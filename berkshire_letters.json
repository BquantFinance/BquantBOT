    "text": "Chairman's Letter - 1977\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Stockholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOperating earnings in 1977 of $21,904,000, or $22.54 per\nshare, were moderately better than anticipated a year ago.\nOf\nthese earnings, $1.43 per share resulted from substantial\nrealized capital gains by Blue Chip Stamps which, to the extent\nof our proportional interest in that company, are included in our\noperating earnings figure.\nCapital gains or losses realized\ndirectly by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. or its insurance subsidiaries\nare not included in our calculation of operating earnings.\nWhile\ntoo much attention should not be paid to the figure for any\nsingle year, over the longer term the record regarding aggregate\ncapital gains or losses obviously is of significance.\nTextile operations came in well below forecast, while the\nresults of the Illinois National Bank as well as the operating\nearnings attributable to our equity interest in Blue Chip Stamps\nwere about as anticipated.\nHowever, insurance operations, led\nagain by the truly outstanding results of Phil Liesches\nmanagerial group at National Indemnity Company, were even better\nthan our optimistic expectations.\nMost companies define record earnings as a new high in\nearnings per share.\nSince businesses customarily add from year\nto year to their equity base, we find nothing particularly\nnoteworthy in a management performance combining, say, a 10%\nincrease in equity capital and a 5% increase in earnings per\nshare.\nAfter all, even a totally dormant savings account will\nproduce steadily rising interest earnings each year because of\ncompounding.\nExcept for special cases (for example, companies with\nunusual debt-equity ratios or those with important assets carried\nat unrealistic balance sheet values), we believe a more\nappropriate measure of managerial economic performance to be\nreturn on equity capital.\nIn 1977 our operating earnings on\nbeginning equity capital amounted to 19%, slightly better than\nlast year and above both our own long-term average and that of\nAmerican industry in aggregate.\nBut, while our operating\nearnings per share were up 37% from the year before, our\nbeginning capital was up 24%, making the gain in earnings per\nshare considerably less impressive than it might appear at first\nglance.\nWe expect difficulty in matching our 1977 rate of return\nduring the forthcoming year.\nBeginning equity capital is up 23%\nfrom a year ago, and we expect the trend of insurance\nunderwriting profit margins to turn down well before the end of\nthe year.\nNevertheless, we expect a reasonably good year and our\npresent estimate, subject to the usual caveats regarding the\nfrailties of forecasts, is that operating earnings will improve\nsomewhat on a per share basis during 1978.\nTextile Operations\nThe textile business again had a very poor year in 1977.\nWe\nhave mistakenly predicted better results in each of the last two\nyears.\nThis may say something about our forecasting abilities,\nthe nature of the textile industry, or both.\nDespite strenuous\nefforts, problems in marketing and manufacturing have persisted.\nMany difficulties experienced in the marketing area are due\nprimarily to industry conditions, but some of the problems have\nbeen of our own making.\nA few shareholders have questioned the wisdom of remaining\nin the textile business which, over the longer term, is unlikely\nto produce returns on capital comparable to those available in\nmany other businesses.\nOur reasons are several: (1) Our mills in\nboth New Bedford and Manchester are among the largest employers\nin each town, utilizing a labor force of high average age\npossessing relatively non-transferable skills.\nOur workers and\nunions have exhibited unusual understanding and effort in\ncooperating with management to achieve a cost structure and\nproduct mix which might allow us to maintain a viable operation.\n(2) Management also has been energetic and straightforward in its\napproach to our textile problems.\nIn particular, Ken Chaces\nefforts after the change in corporate control took place in 1965\ngenerated capital from the textile division needed to finance the\nacquisition and expansion of our profitable insurance operation.\n(3) With hard work and some imagination regarding manufacturing\nand marketing configurations, it seems reasonable that at least\nmodest profits in the textile division can be achieved in the\nfuture.\nInsurance Underwriting\nOur insurance operation continued to grow significantly in\n1977.\nIt was early in 1967 that we made our entry into this\nindustry through the purchase of National Indemnity Company and\nNational Fire and Marine Insurance Company (sister companies) for\napproximately $8.6 million.\nIn that year their premium volume\namounted to $22 million.\nIn 1977 our aggregate insurance premium\nvolume was $151 million.\nNo additional shares of Berkshire\nHathaway stock have been issued to achieve any of this growth.\nRather, this almost 600% increase has been achieved through\nlarge gains in National Indemnitys traditional liability areas\nplus the starting of new companies (Cornhusker Casualty Company\nin 1970, Lakeland Fire and Casualty Company in 1971, Texas United\nInsurance Company in 1972, The Insurance Company of Iowa in 1973,\nand Kansas Fire and Casualty Company in late 1977), the purchase\nfor cash of other insurance companies (Home and Automobile\nInsurance Company in 1971, Kerkling Reinsurance Corporation, now\nnamed Central Fire and Casualty Company, in 1976, and Cypress\nInsurance Company at yearend 1977), and finally through the\nmarketing of additional products, most significantly reinsurance,\nwithin the National Indemnity Company corporate structure.\nIn aggregate, the insurance business has worked out very\nwell.\nBut it hasnt been a one-way street.\nSome major mistakes\nhave been made during the decade, both in products and personnel.\nWe experienced significant problems from (1) a surety operation\ninitiated in 1969, (2) the 1973 expansion of Home and\nAutomobiles urban auto marketing into the Miami, Florida area,\n(3) a still unresolved aviation fronting arrangement, and (4)\nour Workers Compensation operation in California, which we\nbelieve retains an interesting potential upon completion of a\nreorganization now in progress.\nIt is comforting to be in a\nbusiness where some mistakes can be made and yet a quite\nsatisfactory overall performance can be achieved.\nIn a sense,\nthis is the opposite case from our textile business where even\nvery good management probably can average only modest results.\nOne of the lessons your management has learned - and,\nunfortunately, sometimes re-learned - is the importance of being\nin businesses where tailwinds prevail rather than headwinds.\nIn 1977 the winds in insurance underwriting were squarely\nbehind us.\nVery large rate increases were effected throughout\nthe industry in 1976 to offset the disastrous underwriting\nresults of 1974 and 1975.\nBut, because insurance policies\ntypically are written for one-year periods, with pricing mistakes\ncapable of correction only upon renewal, it was 1977 before the\nfull impact was felt upon earnings of those earlier rate\nincreases.\nThe pendulum now is beginning to swing the other way.\nWe\nestimate that costs involved in the insurance areas in which we\noperate rise at close to 1% per month.\nThis is due to continuous\nmonetary inflation affecting the cost of repairing humans and\nproperty, as well as social inflation, a broadening definition\nby society and juries of what is covered by insurance policies.\nUnless rates rise at a comparable 1% per month, underwriting\nprofits must shrink.\nRecently the pace of rate increases has\nslowed dramatically, and it is our expectation that underwriting\nmargins generally will be declining by the second half of the\nyear.\nWe must again give credit to Phil Liesche, greatly assisted\nby Roland Miller in Underwriting and Bill Lyons in Claims, for an\nextraordinary underwriting achievement in National Indemnitys\ntraditional auto and general liability business during 1977.\nLarge volume gains have been accompanied by excellent\nunderwriting margins following contraction or withdrawal by many\ncompetitors in the wake of the 1974-75 crisis period.\nThese\nconditions will reverse before long.\nIn the meantime, National\nIndemnitys underwriting profitability has increased dramatically\nand, in addition, large sums have been made available for\ninvestment.\nAs markets loosen and rates become inadequate, we\nagain will face the challenge of philosophically accepting\nreduced volume.\nUnusual managerial discipline will be required,\nas it runs counter to normal institutional behavior to let the\nother fellow take away business - even at foolish prices.\nOur reinsurance department, managed by George Young,\nimproved its underwriting performance during 1977.\nAlthough the\ncombined ratio (see definition on page 12) of 107.1 was\nunsatisfactory, its trend was downward throughout the year.\nIn\naddition, reinsurance generates unusually high funds for\ninvestment as a percentage of premium volume.\nAt Home and Auto, John Seward continued to make progress on\nall fronts.\nJohn was a battlefield promotion several years ago\nwhen Home and Autos underwriting was awash in red ink and the\ncompany faced possible extinction.\nUnder his management it\ncurrently is sound, profitable, and growing.\nJohn Ringwalts homestate operation now consists of five\ncompanies, with Kansas Fire and Casualty Company becoming\noperational late in 1977 under the direction of Floyd Taylor.\nThe homestate companies had net premium volume of $23 million, up\nfrom $5.5 million just three years ago.\nAll four companies that\noperated throughout the year achieved combined ratios below 100,\nwith Cornhusker Casualty Company, at 93.8, the leader.\nIn\naddition to actively supervising the other four homestate\noperations, John Ringwalt manages the operations of Cornhusker\nwhich has recorded combined ratios below 100 in six of its seven\nfull years of existence and, from a standing start in 1970, has\ngrown to be one of the leading insurance companies operating in\nNebraska utilizing the conventional independent agency system.\nLakeland Fire and Casualty Company, managed by Jim Stodolka, was\nthe winner of the Chairmans Cup in 1977 for achieving the lowest\nloss ratio among the homestate companies.\nAll in all, the\nhomestate operation continues to make excellent progress.\nThe newest addition to our insurance group is Cypress\nInsurance Company of South Pasadena, California.\nThis Workers\nCompensation insurer was purchased for cash in the final days of\n1977 and, therefore, its approximate $12.5 million of volume for\nthat year was not included in our results.\nCypress and National\nIndemnitys present California Workers Compensation operation\nwill not be combined, but will operate independently utilizing\nsomewhat different marketing strategies.\nMilt Thornton,\nPresident of Cypress since 1968, runs a first-class operation for\npolicyholders, agents, employees and owners alike.\nWe look\nforward to working with him.\nInsurance companies offer standardized policies which can be\ncopied by anyone.\nTheir only products are promises.\nIt is not\ndifficult to be licensed, and rates are an open book.\nThere are\nno important advantages from trademarks, patents, location,\ncorporate longevity, raw material sources, etc., and very little\nconsumer differentiation to produce insulation from competition.\nIt is commonplace, in corporate annual reports, to stress the\ndifference that people make.\nSometimes this is true and\nsometimes it isnt.\nBut there is no question that the nature of\nthe insurance business magnifies the effect which individual\nmanagers have on company performance.\nWe are very fortunate to\nhave the group of managers that are associated with us.\nInsurance Investments\nDuring the past two years insurance investments at cost\n(excluding the investment in our affiliate, Blue Chip Stamps)\nhave grown from $134.6 million to $252.8 million.\nGrowth in\ninsurance reserves, produced by our large gain in premium volume,\nplus retained earnings, have accounted for this increase in\nmarketable securities.\nIn turn, net investment income of the\nInsurance Group has improved from $8.4 million pre-tax in 1975 to\n$12.3 million pre-tax in 1977.\nIn addition to this income from dividends and interest, we\nrealized capital gains of $6.9 million before tax, about one-\nquarter from bonds and the balance from stocks.\nOur unrealized\ngain in stocks at yearend 1977 was approximately $74 million but\nthis figure, like any other figure of a single date (we had an\nunrealized loss of $17 million at the end of 1974), should not be\ntaken too seriously.\nMost of our large stock positions are going\nto be held for many years and the scorecard on our investment\ndecisions will be provided by business results over that period,\nand not by prices on any given day.\nJust as it would be foolish\nto focus unduly on short-term prospects when acquiring an entire\ncompany, we think it equally unsound to become mesmerized by\nprospective near term earnings or recent trends in earnings when\npurchasing small pieces of a company; i.e., marketable common\nstocks.\nA little digression illustrating this point may be\ninteresting.\nBerkshire Fine Spinning Associates and Hathaway\nManufacturing were merged in 1955 to form Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\nIn 1948, on a pro forma combined basis, they had earnings after\ntax of almost $18 million and employed 10,000 people at a dozen\nlarge mills throughout New England.\nIn the business world of\nthat period they were an economic powerhouse.\nFor example, in\nthat same year earnings of IBM were $28 million (now $2.7\nbillion), Safeway Stores, $10 million, Minnesota Mining, $13\nmillion, and Time, Inc., $9 million.\nBut, in the decade\nfollowing the 1955 merger aggregate sales of $595 million\nproduced an aggregate loss for Berkshire Hathaway of $10 million.\nBy 1964 the operation had been reduced to two mills and net worth\nhad shrunk to $22 million, from $53 million at the time of the\nmerger.\nSo much for single year snapshots as adequate portrayals\nof a business.\nEquity holdings of our insurance companies with a market\nvalue of over $5 million on December 31, 1977 were as follows:\nNo. of

$106,889\n$181,073\n========\n========\nWe select our marketable equity securities in much the same\nway we would evaluate a business for acquisition in its entirety.\nWe want the business to be (1) one that we can understand, (2)\nwith favorable long-term prospects, (3) operated by honest and\ncompetent people, and (4) available at a very attractive price.\nWe ordinarily make no attempt to buy equities for anticipated\nfavorable stock price behavior in the short term.\nIn fact, if\ntheir business experience continues to satisfy us, we welcome\nlower market prices of stocks we own as an opportunity to acquire\neven more of a good thing at a better price.\nOur experience has been that pro-rata portions of truly\noutstanding businesses sometimes sell in the securities markets\nat very large discounts from the prices they would command in\nnegotiated transactions involving entire companies.\nConsequently, bargains in business ownership, which simply are\nnot available directly through corporate acquisition, can be\nobtained indirectly through stock ownership.\nWhen prices are\nappropriate, we are willing to take very large positions in\nselected companies, not with any intention of taking control and\nnot foreseeing sell-out or merger, but with the expectation that\nexcellent business results by corporations will translate over\nthe long term into correspondingly excellent market value and\ndividend results for owners, minority as well as majority.\nSuch investments initially may have negligible impact on our\noperating earnings.\nFor example, we invested $10.9 million in\nCapital Cities Communications during 1977.\nEarnings attributable\nto the shares we purchased totaled about $1.3 million last year.\nBut only the cash dividend, which currently provides $40,000\nannually, is reflected in our operating earnings figure.\nCapital Cities possesses both extraordinary properties and\nextraordinary management.\nAnd these management skills extend\nequally to operations and employment of corporate capital.\nTo\npurchase, directly, properties such as Capital Cities owns would\ncost in the area of twice our cost of purchase via the stock\nmarket, and direct ownership would offer no important advantages\nto us.\nWhile control would give us the opportunity - and the\nresponsibility - to manage operations and corporate resources, we\nwould not be able to provide management in either of those\nrespects equal to that now in place.\nIn effect, we can obtain a\nbetter management result through non-control than control.\nThis\nis an unorthodox view, but one we believe to be sound.\nBanking\nIn 1977 the Illinois National Bank continued to achieve a\nrate of earnings on assets about three times that of most large\nbanks.\nAs usual, this record was achieved while the bank paid\nmaximum rates to savers and maintained an asset position\ncombining low risk and exceptional liquidity.\nGene Abegg formed\nthe bank in 1931 with $250,000.\nIn its first full year of\noperation, earnings amounted to $8,782.\nSince that time, no new\ncapital has been contributed to the bank; on the contrary, since\nour purchase in 1969, dividends of $20 million have been paid.\nEarnings in 1977 amounted to $3.6 million, more than achieved by\nmany banks two or three times its size.\nLate last year Gene, now 80 and still running a banking\noperation without peer, asked that a successor be brought in.\nAccordingly, Peter Jeffrey, formerly President and Chief\nExecutive Officer of American National Bank of Omaha, has joined\nthe Illinois National Bank effective March 1st as President and\nChief Executive Officer.\nGene continues in good health as Chairman.\nWe expect a\ncontinued successful operation at Rockfords leading bank.\nBlue Chip Stamps\nWe again increased our equity interest in Blue Chip Stamps,\nand owned approximately 36 1/2% at the end of 1977.\nBlue Chip\nhad a fine year, earning approximately $12.9 million from\noperations and, in addition, had realized securities gains of\n$4.1 million.\nBoth Wesco Financial Corp., an 80% owned subsidiary of Blue\nChip Stamps, managed by Louis Vincenti, and Sees Candies, a 99%\nowned subsidiary, managed by Chuck Huggins, made good progress in\n1977.\nSince Sees was purchased by Blue Chip Stamps at the\nbeginning of 1972, pre-tax operating earnings have grown from\n$4.2 million to $12.6 million with little additional capital\ninvestment.\nSees achieved this record while operating in an\nindustry experiencing practically no unit growth.\nShareholders\nof Berkshire Hathaway Inc. may obtain the annual report of Blue\nChip Stamps by requesting it from Mr. Robert H. Bird, Blue Chip\nStamps, 5801 South Eastern Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90040.\nWarren E. Buffett, Chairman\nMarch 14,1978",

    "text": "Chairman's Letter - 1978\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nFirst, a few words about accounting.\nThe merger with\nDiversified Retailing Company, Inc. at yearend adds two new\ncomplications in the presentation of our financial results.\nAfter the merger, our ownership of Blue Chip Stamps increased to\napproximately 58% and, therefore, the accounts of that company\nmust be fully consolidated in the Balance Sheet and Statement of\nEarnings presentation of Berkshire.\nIn previous reports, our\nshare of the net earnings only of Blue Chip had been included as\na single item on Berkshires Statement of Earnings, and there had\nbeen a similar one-line inclusion on our Balance Sheet of our\nshare of their net assets.\nThis full consolidation of sales, expenses, receivables,\ninventories, debt, etc. produces an aggregation of figures from\nmany diverse businesses - textiles, insurance, candy, newspapers,\ntrading stamps - with dramatically different economic\ncharacteristics.\nIn some of these your ownership is 100% but, in\nthose businesses which are owned by Blue Chip but fully\nconsolidated, your ownership as a Berkshire shareholder is only\n58%. (Ownership by others of the balance of these businesses is\naccounted for by the large minority interest item on the\nliability side of the Balance Sheet.) Such a grouping of Balance\nSheet and Earnings items - some wholly owned, some partly owned -\ntends to obscure economic reality more than illuminate it.\nIn\nfact, it represents a form of presentation that we never prepare\nfor internal use during the year and which is of no value to us\nin any management activities.\nFor that reason, throughout the report we provide much\nseparate financial information and commentary on the various\nsegments of the business to help you evaluate Berkshires\nperformance and prospects.\nMuch of this segmented information is\nmandated by SEC disclosure rules and covered in Managements\nDiscussion on pages 29 to 34.\nAnd in this letter we try to\npresent to you a view of our various operating entities from the\nsame perspective that we view them managerially.\nA second complication arising from the merger is that the\n1977 figures shown in this report are different from the 1977\nfigures shown in the report we mailed to you last year.\nAccounting convention requires that when two entities such as\nDiversified and Berkshire are merged, all financial data\nsubsequently must be presented as if the companies had been\nmerged at the time they were formed rather than just recently.\nSo the enclosed financial statements, in effect, pretend that in\n1977 (and earlier years) the Diversified-Berkshire merger already\nhad taken place, even though the actual merger date was December\n30, 1978.\nThis shifting base makes comparative commentary\nconfusing and, from time to time in our narrative report, we will\ntalk of figures and performance for Berkshire shareholders as\nhistorically reported to you rather than as restated after the\nDiversified merger.\nWith that preamble it can be stated that, with or without\nrestated figures, 1978 was a good year.\nOperating earnings,\nexclusive of capital gains, at 19.4% of beginning shareholders\ninvestment were within a fraction of our 1972 record.\nWhile we\nbelieve it is improper to include capital gains or losses in\nevaluating the performance of a single year, they are an\nimportant component of the longer term record.\nBecause of such\ngains, Berkshires long-term growth in equity per share has been\ngreater than would be indicated by compounding the returns from\noperating earnings that we have reported annually.\nFor example, over the last three years - generally a bonanza\nperiod for the insurance industry, our largest profit producer -\nBerkshires per share net worth virtually has doubled, thereby\ncompounding at about 25% annually through a combination of good\noperating earnings and fairly substantial capital gains.\nNeither\nthis 25% equity gain from all sources nor the 19.4% equity gain\nfrom operating earnings in 1978 is sustainable.\nThe insurance\ncycle has turned downward in 1979, and it is almost certain that\noperating earnings measured by return on equity will fall this\nyear.\nHowever, operating earnings measured in dollars are likely\nto increase on the much larger shareholders equity now employed\nin the business.\nIn contrast to this cautious view about near term return\nfrom operations, we are optimistic about prospects for long term\nreturn from major equity investments held by our insurance\ncompanies.\nWe make no attempt to predict how security markets\nwill behave; successfully forecasting short term stock price\nmovements is something we think neither we nor anyone else can\ndo.\nIn the longer run, however, we feel that many of our major\nequity holdings are going to be worth considerably more money\nthan we paid, and that investment gains will add significantly to\nthe operating returns of the insurance group.\nSources of Earnings\nTo give you a better picture of just where Berkshires\nearnings are produced, we show below a table which requires a\nlittle explanation.\nBerkshire owns close to 58% of Blue Chip\nwhich, in addition to 100% ownership of several businesses, owns\n80% of Wesco Financial Corporation.\nThus, Berkshires equity in\nWescos earnings is about 46%.\nIn aggregate, businesses that we\ncontrol have about 7,000 full-time employees and generate\nrevenues of over $500 million.\nThe table shows the overall earnings of each major operating\ncategory on a pre-tax basis (several of the businesses have low\ntax rates because of significant amounts of tax-exempt interest\nand dividend income), as well as the share of those earnings\nbelonging to Berkshire both on a pre-tax and after-tax basis.\nSignificant capital gains or losses attributable to any of the\nbusinesses are not shown in the operating earnings figure, but\nare aggregated on the Realized Securities Gain line at the\nbottom of the table.\nBecause of various accounting and tax\nintricacies, the figures in the table should not be treated as\nholy writ, but rather viewed as close approximations of the 1977\nand 1978 earnings contributions of our constituent businesses.\nNet Earnings\nEarnings Before Income Taxes\nAfter Tax\n--------------------------------------\n------------------\nTotal\nBerkshire Share\nBerkshire Share\n------------------\n------------------\n------------------\n(in thousands of dollars)\n1978\n1977\n1978\n1977\n1978\n1977\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nTotal - all entities ......... $66,180\n$57,089\n$54,350\n$42,234\n$39,242\n$30,393\n========\n========\n========\n========\n========\n========\nEarnings from operations:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting ............. $ 3,001\n$ 5,802\n$ 3,000\n$ 5,802\n$ 1,560\n$ 3,017\nNet investment income ....\n19,705\n12,804\n19,691\n12,804\n16,400\n11,360\nBerkshire-Waumbec textiles\n2,916\n(620)\n2,916\n(620)\n1,342\n(322)\nAssociated Retail\nStores, Inc. ............\n2,757\n2,775\n2,757\n2,775\n1,176\n1,429\nSees Candies ..............\n12,482\n12,840\n7,013\n6,598\n3,049\n2,974\nBuffalo Evening News .......\n(2,913)\n751\n(1,637)\n389\n(738)\n158\nBlue Chip Stamps - Parent ..\n2,133\n1,091\n1,198\n566\n1,382\n892\nIllinois National Bank\nand Trust Company .......\n4,822\n3,800\n4,710\n3,706\n4,262\n3,288\nWesco Financial\nCorporation - Parent ....\n1,771\n2,006\n777\n813\n665\n419\nMutual Savings and\nLoan Association ........\n10,556\n6,779\n4,638\n2,747\n3,042\n1,946\nInterest on Debt ...........\n(5,566)\n(5,302)\n(4,546)\n(4,255)\n(2,349)\n(2,129)\nOther ......................\n720\n165\n438\n102\n261\n48\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nTotal Earnings from\nOperations ............ $52,384\n$42,891\n$40,955\n$31,427\n$30,052\n$23,080\nRealized Securities Gain .....\n13,796\n14,198\n13,395\n10,807\n9,190\n7,313\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nTotal Earnings ........... $66,180\n$57,089\n$54,350\n$42,234\n$39,242\n$30,393\n========\n========\n========\n========\n========\n========\nBlue Chip and Wesco are public companies with reporting\nrequirements of their own.\nLater in this report we are\nreproducing the narrative reports of the principal executives of\nboth companies, describing their 1978 operations.\nSome of the\nfigures they utilize will not match to the penny the ones we use\nin this report, again because of accounting and tax complexities.\nBut their comments should be helpful to you in understanding the\nunderlying economic characteristics of these important partly-\nowned businesses.\nA copy of the full annual report of either\ncompany will be mailed to any shareholder of Berkshire upon\nrequest to Mr. Robert H. Bird for Blue Chips Stamps, 5801 South\nEastern Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90040, or to Mrs. Bette\nDeckard for Wesco Financial Corporation, 315 East Colorado\nBoulevard, Pasadena, California 91109.\nTextiles\nEarnings of $1.3 million in 1978, while much improved from\n1977, still represent a low return on the $17 million of capital\nemployed in this business.\nTextile plant and equipment are on\nthe books for a very small fraction of what it would cost to\nreplace such equipment today.\nAnd, despite the age of the\nequipment, much of it is functionally similar to new equipment\nbeing installed by the industry.\nBut despite this bargain cost\nof fixed assets, capital turnover is relatively low reflecting\nrequired high investment levels in receivables and inventory\ncompared to sales.\nSlow capital turnover, coupled with low\nprofit margins on sales, inevitably produces inadequate returns\non capital.\nObvious approaches to improved profit margins\ninvolve differentiation of product, lowered manufacturing costs\nthrough more efficient equipment or better utilization of people,\nredirection toward fabrics enjoying stronger market trends, etc.\nOur management is diligent in pursuing such objectives.\nThe\nproblem, of course, is that our competitors are just as\ndiligently doing the same thing.\nThe textile industry illustrates in textbook style how\nproducers of relatively undifferentiated goods in capital\nintensive businesses must earn inadequate returns except under\nconditions of tight supply or real shortage.\nAs long as excess\nproductive capacity exists, prices tend to reflect direct\noperating costs rather than capital employed.\nSuch a supply-\nexcess condition appears likely to prevail most of the time in\nthe textile industry, and our expectations are for profits of\nrelatively modest amounts in relation to capital.\nWe hope we dont get into too many more businesses with such\ntough economic characteristics.\nBut, as we have stated before:\n(1) our textile businesses are very important employers in their\ncommunities, (2) management has been straightforward in reporting\non problems and energetic in attacking them, (3) labor has been\ncooperative and understanding in facing our common problems, and\n(4) the business should average modest cash returns relative to\ninvestment.\nAs long as these conditions prevail - and we expect\nthat they will - we intend to continue to support our textile\nbusiness despite more attractive alternative uses for capital.\nInsurance Underwriting\nThe number one contributor to Berkshires overall excellent\nresults in 1978 was the segment of National Indemnity Companys\ninsurance operation run by Phil Liesche.\nOn about $90 million of\nearned premiums, an underwriting profit of approximately $11\nmillion was realized, a truly extraordinary achievement even\nagainst the background of excellent industry conditions.\nUnder\nPhils leadership, with outstanding assistance by Roland Miller\nin Underwriting and Bill Lyons in Claims, this segment of\nNational Indemnity (including National Fire and Marine Insurance\nCompany, which operates as a running mate) had one of its best\nyears in a long history of performances which, in aggregate, far\noutshine those of the industry.\nPresent successes reflect credit\nnot only upon present managers, but equally upon the business\ntalents of Jack Ringwalt, founder of National Indemnity, whose\noperating philosophy remains etched upon the company.\nHome and Automobile Insurance Company had its best year\nsince John Seward stepped in and straightened things out in 1975.\nIts results are combined in this report with those of Phil\nLiesches operation under the insurance category entitled\nSpecialized Auto and General Liability.\nWorkers Compensation was a mixed bag in 1978.\nIn its first\nyear as a subsidiary, Cypress Insurance Company, managed by Milt\nThornton, turned in outstanding results.\nThe workers\ncompensation line can cause large underwriting losses when rapid\ninflation interacts with changing social concepts, but Milt has a\ncautious and highly professional staff to cope with these\nproblems.\nHis performance in 1978 has reinforced our very good\nfeelings about this purchase.\nFrank DeNardo came with us in the spring of 1978 to\nstraighten out National Indemnitys California Workers\nCompensation business which, up to that point, had been a\ndisaster.\nFrank has the experience and intellect needed to\ncorrect the major problems of the Los Angeles office.\nOur volume\nin this department now is running only about 25% of what it was\neighteen months ago, and early indications are that Frank is\nmaking good progress.\nGeorge Youngs reinsurance department continues to produce\nvery large sums for investment relative to premium volume, and\nthus gives us reasonably satisfactory overall results.\nHowever,\nunderwriting results still are not what they should be and can\nbe.\nIt is very easy to fool yourself regarding underwriting\nresults in reinsurance (particularly in casualty lines involving\nlong delays in settlement), and we believe this situation\nprevails with many of our competitors.\nUnfortunately, self-\ndelusion in company reserving almost always leads to inadequate\nindustry rate levels.\nIf major factors in the market dont know\ntheir true costs, the competitive fall-out hits all - even\nthose with adequate cost knowledge.\nGeorge is quite willing to\nreduce volume significantly, if needed, to achieve satisfactory\nunderwriting, and we have a great deal of confidence in the long\nterm soundness of this business under his direction.\nThe homestate operation was disappointing in 1978.\nOur\nunsatisfactory underwriting, even though partially explained by\nan unusual incidence of Midwestern storms, is particularly\nworrisome against the backdrop of very favorable industry results\nin the conventional lines written by our homestate group.\nWe\nhave confidence in John Ringwalts ability to correct this\nsituation.\nThe bright spot in the group was the performance of\nKansas Fire and Casualty in its first full year of business.\nUnder Floyd Taylor, this subsidiary got off to a truly remarkable\nstart.\nOf course, it takes at least several years to evaluate\nunderwriting results, but the early signs are encouraging and\nFloyds operation achieved the best loss ratio among the\nhomestate companies in 1978.\nAlthough some segments were disappointing, overall our\ninsurance operation had an excellent year.\nBut of course we\nshould expect a good year when the industry is flying high, as in\n1978.\nIt is a virtual certainty that in 1979 the combined ratio\n(see definition on page 31) for the industry will move up at\nleast a few points, perhaps enough to throw the industry as a\nwhole into an underwriting loss position.\nFor example, in the\nauto lines - by far the most important area for the industry and\nfor us - CPI figures indicate rates overall were only 3% higher\nin January 1979 than a year ago.\nBut the items that make up loss\ncosts - auto repair and medical care costs - were up over 9%.\nHow different than yearend 1976 when rates had advanced over 22%\nin the preceding twelve months, but costs were up 8%.\nMargins will remain steady only if rates rise as fast as\ncosts.\nThis assuredly will not be the case in 1979, and\nconditions probably will worsen in 1980.\nOur present thinking is\nthat our underwriting performance relative to the industry will\nimprove somewhat in 1979, but every other insurance management\nprobably views its relative prospects with similar optimism -\nsomeone is going to be disappointed.\nEven if we do improve\nrelative to others, we may well have a higher combined ratio and\nlower underwriting profits in 1979 than we achieved last year.\nWe continue to look for ways to expand our insurance\noperation.\nBut your reaction to this intent should not be\nunrestrained joy.\nSome of our expansion efforts - largely\ninitiated by your Chairman have been lackluster, others have been\nexpensive failures.\nWe entered the business in 1967 through\npurchase of the segment which Phil Liesche now manages, and it\nstill remains, by a large margin, the best portion of our\ninsurance business.\nIt is not easy to buy a good insurance\nbusiness, but our experience has been that it is easier to buy\none than create one.\nHowever, we will continue to try both\napproaches, since the rewards for success in this field can be\nexceptional.\nInsurance Investments\nWe confess considerable optimism regarding our insurance\nequity investments.\nOf course, our enthusiasm for stocks is not\nunconditional.\nUnder some circumstances, common stock\ninvestments by insurers make very little sense.\nWe get excited enough to commit a big percentage of\ninsurance company net worth to equities only when we find (1)\nbusinesses we can understand, (2) with favorable long-term\nprospects, (3) operated by honest and competent people, and (4)\npriced very attractively.\nWe usually can identify a small number\nof potential investments meeting requirements (1), (2) and (3),\nbut (4) often prevents action.\nFor example, in 1971 our total\ncommon stock position at Berkshires insurance subsidiaries\namounted to only $10.7 million at cost, and $11.7 million at\nmarket.\nThere were equities of identifiably excellent companies\navailable - but very few at interesting prices. (An irresistible\nfootnote: in 1971, pension fund managers invested a record 122%\nof net funds available in equities - at full prices they couldnt\nbuy enough of them.\nIn 1974, after the bottom had fallen out,\nthey committed a then record low of 21% to stocks.)\nThe past few years have been a different story for us.\nAt\nthe end of 1975 our insurance subsidiaries held common equities\nwith a market value exactly equal to cost of $39.3 million.\nAt\nthe end of 1978 this position had been increased to equities\n(including a convertible preferred) with a cost of $129.1 million\nand a market value of $216.5 million.\nDuring the intervening\nthree years we also had realized pre-tax gains from common\nequities of approximately $24.7 million.\nTherefore, our overall\nunrealized and realized pre-tax gains in equities for the three\nyear period came to approximately $112 million.\nDuring this same\ninterval the Dow-Jones Industrial Average declined from 852 to\n805.\nIt was a marvelous period for the value-oriented equity\nbuyer.\nWe continue to find for our insurance portfolios small\nportions of really outstanding businesses that are available,\nthrough the auction pricing mechanism of security markets, at\nprices dramatically cheaper than the valuations inferior\nbusinesses command on negotiated sales.\nThis program of acquisition of small fractions of businesses\n(common stocks) at bargain prices, for which little enthusiasm\nexists, contrasts sharply with general corporate acquisition\nactivity, for which much enthusiasm exists.\nIt seems quite clear\nto us that either corporations are making very significant\nmistakes in purchasing entire businesses at prices prevailing in\nnegotiated transactions and takeover bids, or that we eventually\nare going to make considerable sums of money buying small\nportions of such businesses at the greatly discounted valuations\nprevailing in the stock market. (A second footnote: in 1978\npension managers, a group that logically should maintain the\nlongest of investment perspectives, put only 9% of net available\nfunds into equities - breaking the record low figure set in 1974\nand tied in 1977.)\nWe are not concerned with whether the market quickly\nrevalues upward securities that we believe are selling at bargain\nprices.\nIn fact, we prefer just the opposite since, in most\nyears, we expect to have funds available to be a net buyer of\nsecurities.\nAnd consistent attractive purchasing is likely to\nprove to be of more eventual benefit to us than any selling\nopportunities provided by a short-term run up in stock prices to\nlevels at which we are unwilling to continue buying.\nOur policy is to concentrate holdings.\nWe try to avoid\nbuying a little of this or that when we are only lukewarm about\nthe business or its price.\nWhen we are convinced as to\nattractiveness, we believe in buying worthwhile amounts.\nEquity holdings of our insurance companies with a market value of\nover $8 million on December 31, 1978 were as follows:\nNo. of\nShares\nCompany\nCost\nMarket\n----------\n-------\n----------\n----------\n(000s omitted)\n246,450\nAmerican Broadcasting Companies, Inc. ... $\n6,082\n$\n8,626\n1,294,308\nGovernment Employees Insurance Company\nCommon Stock .........................\n4,116\n9,060\n1,986,953\nGovernment Employees Insurance Company\nConvertible Preferred ................\n19,417\n28,314\n592,650\nInterpublic Group of Companies, Inc. ....\n4,531\n19,039\n1,066,934\nKaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation\n18,085\n18,671\n453,800\nKnight-Ridder Newspapers, Inc. ..........\n7,534\n10,267\n953,750\nSAFECO Corporation ......................\n23,867\n26,467\n934,300\nThe Washington Post Company .............\n10,628\n43,445\n----------\n----------\nTotal ................................... $ 94,260\n$163,889\nAll Other Holdings ......................\n39,506\n57,040\n----------\n----------\nTotal Equities .......................... $133,766\n$220,929\n==========\n==========\nIn some cases our indirect interest in earning power is\nbecoming quite substantial.\nFor example, note our holdings of\n953,750 shares of SAFECO Corp. SAFECO probably is the best run\nlarge property and casualty insurance company in the United\nStates.\nTheir underwriting abilities are simply superb, their\nloss reserving is conservative, and their investment policies\nmake great sense.\nSAFECO is a much better insurance operation than our own\n(although we believe certain segments of ours are much better\nthan average), is better than one we could develop and,\nsimilarly, is far better than any in which we might negotiate\npurchase of a controlling interest.\nYet our purchase of SAFECO\nwas made at substantially under book value.\nWe paid less than\n100 cents on the dollar for the best company in the business,\nwhen far more than 100 cents on the dollar is being paid for\nmediocre companies in corporate transactions.\nAnd there is no\nway to start a new operation - with necessarily uncertain\nprospects - at less than 100 cents on the dollar.\nOf course, with a minor interest we do not have the right to\ndirect or even influence management policies of SAFECO.\nBut why\nshould we wish to do this?\nThe record would indicate that they\ndo a better job of managing their operations than we could do\nourselves.\nWhile there may be less excitement and prestige in\nsitting back and letting others do the work, we think that is all\none loses by accepting a passive participation in excellent\nmanagement.\nBecause, quite clearly, if one controlled a company\nrun as well as SAFECO, the proper policy also would be to sit\nback and let management do its job.\nEarnings attributable to the shares of SAFECO owned by\nBerkshire at yearend amounted to $6.1 million during 1978, but\nonly the dividends received (about 18% of earnings) are reflected\nin our operating earnings.\nWe believe the balance, although not\nreportable, to be just as real in terms of eventual benefit to us\nas the amount distributed.\nIn fact, SAFECOs retained earnings\n(or those of other well-run companies if they have opportunities\nto employ additional capital advantageously) may well eventually\nhave a value to shareholders greater than 100 cents on the\ndollar.\nWe are not at all unhappy when our wholly-owned businesses\nretain all of their earnings if they can utilize internally those\nfunds at attractive rates.\nWhy should we feel differently about\nretention of earnings by companies in which we hold small equity\ninterests, but where the record indicates even better prospects\nfor profitable employment of capital? (This proposition cuts the\nother way, of course, in industries with low capital\nrequirements, or if management has a record of plowing capital\ninto projects of low profitability; then earnings should be paid\nout or used to repurchase shares - often by far the most\nattractive option for capital utilization.)\nThe aggregate level of such retained earnings attributable\nto our equity interests in fine companies is becoming quite\nsubstantial.\nIt does not enter into our reported operating\nearnings, but we feel it well may have equal long-term\nsignificance to our shareholders.\nOur hope is that conditions\ncontinue to prevail in securities markets which allow our\ninsurance companies to buy large amounts of underlying earning\npower for relatively modest outlays.\nAt some point market\nconditions undoubtedly will again preclude such bargain buying\nbut, in the meantime, we will try to make the most of\nopportunities.\nBanking\nUnder Gene Abegg and Pete Jeffrey, the Illinois National\nBank and Trust Company in Rockford continues to establish new\nrecords.\nLast years earnings amounted to approximately 2.1% of\naverage assets, about three times the level averaged by major\nbanks.\nIn our opinion, this extraordinary level of earnings is\nbeing achieved while maintaining significantly less asset risk\nthan prevails at most of the larger banks.\nWe purchased the Illinois National Bank in March 1969.\nIt\nwas a first-class operation then, just as it had been ever since\nGene Abegg opened the doors in 1931.\nSince 1968, consumer time\ndeposits have quadrupled, net income has tripled and trust\ndepartment income has more than doubled, while costs have been\nclosely controlled.\nOur experience has been that the manager of an already high-\ncost operation frequently is uncommonly resourceful in finding\nnew ways to add to overhead, while the manager of a tightly-run\noperation usually continues to find additional methods to curtail\ncosts, even when his costs are already well below those of his\ncompetitors.\nNo one has demonstrated this latter ability better\nthan Gene Abegg.\nWe are required to divest our bank by December 31, 1980.\nThe most likely approach is to spin it off to Berkshire\nshareholders some time in the second half of 1980.\nRetailing\nUpon merging with Diversified, we acquired 100% ownership of\nAssociated Retail Stores, Inc., a chain of about 75 popular\npriced womens apparel stores.\nAssociated was launched in\nChicago on March 7, 1931 with one store, $3200, and two\nextraordinary partners, Ben Rosner and Leo Simon.\nAfter Mr.\nSimons death, the business was offered to Diversified for cash\nin 1967.\nBen was to continue running the business - and run it,\nhe has.\nAssociateds business has not grown, and it consistently has\nfaced adverse demographic and retailing trends.\nBut Bens\ncombination of merchandising, real estate and cost-containment\nskills has produced an outstanding record of profitability, with\nreturns on capital necessarily employed in the business often in\nthe 20% after-tax area.\nBen is now 75 and, like Gene Abegg, 81, at Illinois National\nand Louie Vincenti, 73, at Wesco, continues daily to bring an\nalmost passionately proprietary attitude to the business.\nThis\ngroup of top managers must appear to an outsider to be an\noverreaction on our part to an OEO bulletin on age\ndiscrimination.\nWhile unorthodox, these relationships have been\nexceptionally rewarding, both financially and personally.\nIt is\na real pleasure to work with managers who enjoy coming to work\neach morning and, once there, instinctively and unerringly think\nlike owners.\nWe are associated with some of the very best.\nWarren E.

    "text": "Chairman's Letter - 1979\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nAgain, we must lead off with a few words about accounting.\nSince our last annual report, the accounting profession has\ndecided that equity securities owned by insurance companies must\nbe carried on the balance sheet at market value.\nWe previously\nhave carried such equity securities at the lower of aggregate\ncost or aggregate market value.\nBecause we have large unrealized\ngains in our insurance equity holdings, the result of this new\npolicy is to increase substantially both the 1978 and 1979\nyearend net worth, even after the appropriate liability is\nestablished for taxes on capital gains that would be payable\nshould equities be sold at such market valuations.\nAs you know, Blue Chip Stamps, our 60% owned subsidiary, is\nfully consolidated in Berkshire Hathaways financial statements.\nHowever, Blue Chip still is required to carry its equity\ninvestments at the lower of aggregate cost or aggregate market\nvalue, just as Berkshire Hathaways insurance subsidiaries did\nprior to this year.\nShould the same equities be purchased at an\nidentical price by an insurance subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway\nand by Blue Chip Stamps, present accounting principles often\nwould require that they end up carried on our consolidated\nbalance sheet at two different values. (That should keep you on\nyour toes.) Market values of Blue Chip Stamps equity holdings\nare given in footnote 3 on page 18.\n1979 Operating Results\nWe continue to feel that the ratio of operating earnings\n(before securities gains or losses) to shareholders equity with\nall securities valued at cost is the most appropriate way to\nmeasure any single years operating performance.\nMeasuring such results against shareholders equity with\nsecurities valued at market could significantly distort the\noperating performance percentage because of wide year-to-year\nmarket value changes in the net worth figure that serves as the\ndenominator.\nFor example, a large decline in securities values\ncould result in a very low market value net worth that, in\nturn, could cause mediocre operating earnings to look\nunrealistically good.\nAlternatively, the more successful that\nequity investments have been, the larger the net worth base\nbecomes and the poorer the operating performance figure appears.\nTherefore, we will continue to report operating performance\nmeasured against beginning net worth, with securities valued at\ncost.\nOn this basis, we had a reasonably good operating\nperformance in 1979 - but not quite as good as that of 1978 -\nwith operating earnings amounting to 18.6% of beginning net\nworth.\nEarnings per share, of course, increased somewhat (about\n20%) but we regard this as an improper figure upon which to\nfocus.\nWe had substantially more capital to work with in 1979\nthan in 1978, and our performance in utilizing that capital fell\nshort of the earlier year, even though per-share earnings rose.\nEarnings per share will rise constantly on a dormant savings\naccount or on a U.S. Savings Bond bearing a fixed rate of return\nsimply because earnings (the stated interest rate) are\ncontinuously plowed back and added to the capital base.\nThus,\neven a stopped clock can look like a growth stock if the\ndividend payout ratio is low.\nThe primary test of managerial economic performance is the\nachievement of a high earnings rate on equity capital employed\n(without undue leverage, accounting gimmickry, etc.) and not the\nachievement of consistent gains in earnings per share.\nIn our\nview, many businesses would be better understood by their\nshareholder owners, as well as the general public, if managements\nand financial analysts modified the primary emphasis they place\nupon earnings per share, and upon yearly changes in that figure.\nLong Term Results\nIn measuring long term economic performance - in contrast to\nyearly performance - we believe it is appropriate to recognize\nfully any realized capital gains or losses as well as\nextraordinary items, and also to utilize financial statements\npresenting equity securities at market value.\nSuch capital gains\nor losses, either realized or unrealized, are fully as important\nto shareholders over a period of years as earnings realized in a\nmore routine manner through operations; it is just that their\nimpact is often extremely capricious in the short run, a\ncharacteristic that makes them inappropriate as an indicator of\nsingle year managerial performance.\nThe book value per share of Berkshire Hathaway on September\n30, 1964 (the fiscal yearend prior to the time that your present\nmanagement assumed responsibility) was $19.46 per share.\nAt\nyearend 1979, book value with equity holdings carried at market\nvalue was $335.85 per share.\nThe gain in book value comes to\n20.5% compounded annually.\nThis figure, of course, is far higher\nthan any average of our yearly operating earnings calculations,\nand reflects the importance of capital appreciation of insurance\nequity investments in determining the overall results for our\nshareholders.\nIt probably also is fair to say that the quoted\nbook value in 1964 somewhat overstated the intrinsic value of the\nenterprise, since the assets owned at that time on either a going\nconcern basis or a liquidating value basis were not worth 100\ncents on the dollar. (The liabilities were solid, however.)\nWe have achieved this result while utilizing a low amount of\nleverage (both financial leverage measured by debt to equity, and\noperating leverage measured by premium volume to capital funds of\nour insurance business), and also without significant issuance or\nrepurchase of shares.\nBasically, we have worked with the capital\nwith which we started.\nFrom our textile base we, or our Blue\nChip and Wesco subsidiaries, have acquired total ownership of\nthirteen businesses through negotiated purchases from private\nowners for cash, and have started six others. (Its worth a\nmention that those who have sold to us have, almost without\nexception, treated us with exceptional honor and fairness, both\nat the time of sale and subsequently.)\nBut before we drown in a sea of self-congratulation, a\nfurther - and crucial - observation must be made.\nA few years\nago, a business whose per-share net worth compounded at 20%\nannually would have guaranteed its owners a highly successful\nreal investment return.\nNow such an outcome seems less certain.\nFor the inflation rate, coupled with individual tax rates, will\nbe the ultimate determinant as to whether our internal operating\nperformance produces successful investment results - i.e., a\nreasonable gain in purchasing power from funds committed - for\nyou as shareholders.\nJust as the original 3% savings bond, a 5% passbook savings\naccount or an 8% U.S. Treasury Note have, in turn, been\ntransformed by inflation into financial instruments that chew up,\nrather than enhance, purchasing power over their investment\nlives, a business earning 20% on capital can produce a negative\nreal return for its owners under inflationary conditions not much\nmore severe than presently prevail.\nIf we should continue to achieve a 20% compounded gain - not\nan easy or certain result by any means - and this gain is\ntranslated into a corresponding increase in the market value of\nBerkshire Hathaway stock as it has been over the last fifteen\nyears, your after-tax purchasing power gain is likely to be very\nclose to zero at a 14% inflation rate.\nMost of the remaining six\npercentage points will go for income tax any time you wish to\nconvert your twenty percentage points of nominal annual gain into\ncash.\nThat combination - the inflation rate plus the percentage of\ncapital that must be paid by the owner to transfer into his own\npocket the annual earnings achieved by the business (i.e.,\nordinary income tax on dividends and capital gains tax on\nretained earnings) - can be thought of as an investors misery\nindex.\nWhen this index exceeds the rate of return earned on\nequity by the business, the investors purchasing power (real\ncapital) shrinks even though he consumes nothing at all.\nWe have\nno corporate solution to this problem; high inflation rates will\nnot help us earn higher rates of return on equity.\nOne friendly but sharp-eyed commentator on Berkshire has\npointed out that our book value at the end of 1964 would have\nbought about one-half ounce of gold and, fifteen years later,\nafter we have plowed back all earnings along with much blood,\nsweat and tears, the book value produced will buy about the same\nhalf ounce.\nA similar comparison could be drawn with Middle\nEastern oil.\nThe rub has been that government has been\nexceptionally able in printing money and creating promises, but\nis unable to print gold or create oil.\nWe intend to continue to do as well as we can in managing\nthe internal affairs of the business.\nBut you should understand\nthat external conditions affecting the stability of currency may\nvery well be the most important factor in determining whether\nthere are any real rewards from your investment in Berkshire\nHathaway.\nSources of Earnings\nWe again present a table showing the sources of Berkshires\nearnings.\nAs explained last year, Berkshire owns about 60% of\nBlue Chip Stamps which, in turn, owns 80% of Wesco Financial\nCorporation.\nThe table shows both aggregate earnings of the\nvarious business entities, as well as Berkshires share.\nAll of\nthe significant capital gains or losses attributable to any of\nthe business entities are aggregated in the realized securities\ngain figure at the bottom of the table, and are not included in\noperating earnings.\nNet Earnings\nEarnings Before Income Taxes\nAfter Tax\n--------------------------------------\n------------------\nTotal\nBerkshire Share\nBerkshire Share\n------------------\n------------------\n------------------\n(in thousands of dollars)\n1979\n1978\n1979\n1978\n1979\n1978\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nTotal - all entities ......... $68,632\n$66,180\n$56,427\n$54,350\n$42,817\n$39,242\n========\n========\n========\n========\n========\n========\nEarnings from Operations:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting ............\n$ 3,742\n$ 3,001\n$ 3,741\n$ 3,000\n$ 2,214\n$ 1,560\nNet Investment Income ...\n24,224\n19,705\n24,216\n19,691\n20,106\n16,400\nBerkshire-Waumbec textiles\n1,723\n2,916\n1,723\n2,916\n848\n1,342\nAssociated Retail\nStores, Inc. ...........\n2,775\n2,757\n2,775\n2,757\n1,280\n1,176\nSees Candies .............\n12,785\n12,482\n7,598\n7,013\n3,448\n3,049\nBuffalo Evening News ......\n(4,617)\n(2,913)\n(2,744)\n(1,637)\n(1,333)\n(738)\nBlue Chip Stamps - Parent\n2,397\n2,133\n1,425\n1,198\n1,624\n1,382\nIllinois National Bank and\nTrust Company ..........\n5,747\n4,822\n5,614\n4,710\n5,027\n4,262\nWesco Financial\nCorporation - Parent ...\n2,413\n1,771\n1,098\n777\n937\n665\nMutual Savings and Loan\nAssociation ............\n10,447\n10,556\n4,751\n4,638\n3,261\n3,042\nPrecision Steel ...........\n3,254\n--\n1,480\n--\n723\n--\nInterest on Debt ..........\n(8,248)\n(5,566)\n(5,860)\n(4,546)\n(2,900)\n(2,349)\nOther .....................\n1,342\n720\n996\n438\n753\n261\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nTotal Earnings from\nOperations ..........\n$57,984\n$52,384\n$46,813\n$40,955\n$35,988\n$30,052\nRealized Securities Gain\n10,648\n13,796\n9,614\n13,395\n6,829\n9,190\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nTotal Earnings .........\n$68,632\n$66,180\n$56,427\n$54,350\n$42,817\n$39,242\n========\n========\n========\n========\n========\n========\nBlue Chip and Wesco are public companies with reporting\nrequirements of their own.\nOn pages 37-43 of this report, we\nhave reproduced the narrative reports of the principal executives\nof both companies, in which they describe 1979 operations.\nSome\nof the numbers they mention in their reports are not precisely\nidentical to those in the above table because of accounting and\ntax complexities. (The Yanomamo Indians employ only three\nnumbers: one, two, and more than two.\nMaybe their time will\ncome.) However, the commentary in those reports should be helpful\nto you in understanding the underlying economic characteristics\nand future prospects of the important businesses that they\nmanage.\nA copy of the full annual report of either company will be\nmailed to any shareholder of Berkshire upon request to Mr.\nRobert H. Bird for Blue Chip Stamps, 5801 South Eastern Avenue,\nLos Angeles, California 90040, or to Mrs. Bette Deckard for Wesco\nFinancial Corporation, 315 East Colorado Boulevard, Pasadena,\nCalifornia 91109.\nTextiles and Retailing\nThe relative significance of these two areas has diminished\nsomewhat over the years as our insurance business has grown\ndramatically in size and earnings.\nBen Rosner, at Associated\nRetail Stores, continues to pull rabbits out of the hat - big\nrabbits from a small hat.\nYear after year, he produces very\nlarge earnings relative to capital employed - realized in cash\nand not in increased receivables and inventories as in many other\nretail businesses - in a segment of the market with little growth\nand unexciting demographics.\nBen is now 76 and, like our other\nup-and-comers, Gene Abegg, 82, at Illinois National and Louis\nVincenti, 74, at Wesco, regularly achieves more each year.\nOur textile business also continues to produce some cash,\nbut at a low rate compared to capital employed.\nThis is not a\nreflection on the managers, but rather on the industry in which\nthey operate.\nIn some businesses - a network TV station, for\nexample - it is virtually impossible to avoid earning\nextraordinary returns on tangible capital employed in the\nbusiness.\nAnd assets in such businesses sell at equally\nextraordinary prices, one thousand cents or more on the dollar, a\nvaluation reflecting the splendid, almost unavoidable, economic\nresults obtainable.\nDespite a fancy price tag, the easy\nbusiness may be the better route to go.\nWe can speak from experience, having tried the other route.\nYour Chairman made the decision a few years ago to purchase\nWaumbec Mills in Manchester, New Hampshire, thereby expanding our\ntextile commitment.\nBy any statistical test, the purchase price\nwas an extraordinary bargain; we bought well below the working\ncapital of the business and, in effect, got very substantial\namounts of machinery and real estate for less than nothing.\nBut\nthe purchase was a mistake.\nWhile we labored mightily, new\nproblems arose as fast as old problems were tamed.\nBoth our operating and investment experience cause us to\nconclude that turnarounds seldom turn, and that the same\nenergies and talent are much better employed in a good business\npurchased at a fair price than in a poor business purchased at a\nbargain price.\nAlthough a mistake, the Waumbec acquisition has\nnot been a disaster.\nCertain portions of the operation are\nproving to be valuable additions to our decorator line (our\nstrongest franchise) at New Bedford, and its possible that we\nmay be able to run profitably on a considerably reduced scale at\nManchester.\nHowever, our original rationale did not prove out.\nInsurance Underwriting\nWe predicted last year that the combined underwriting ratio\n(see definition on page 36) for the insurance industry would\nmove up at least a few points, perhaps enough to throw the\nindustry as a whole into an underwriting loss position.\nThat is\njust about the way it worked out.\nThe industry underwriting\nratio rose in 1979 over three points, from roughly 97.4% to\n100.7%. We also said that we thought our underwriting performance\nrelative to the industry would improve somewhat in 1979 and,\nagain, things worked out as expected.\nOur own underwriting ratio\nactually decreased from 98.2% to 97.1%. Our forecast for 1980 is\nsimilar in one respect; again we feel that the industrys\nperformance will worsen by at least another few points.\nHowever,\nthis year we have no reason to think that our performance\nrelative to the industry will further improve. (Dont worry - we\nwont hold back to try to validate that forecast.)\nReally extraordinary results were turned in by the portion\nof National Indemnity Companys insurance operation run by Phil\nLiesche.\nAided by Roland Miller in Underwriting and Bill Lyons\nin Claims, this section of the business produced an underwriting\nprofit of $8.4 million on about $82 million of earned premiums.\nOnly a very few companies in the entire industry produced a\nresult comparable to this.\nYou will notice that earned premiums in this segment were\ndown somewhat from those of 1978.\nWe hear a great many insurance\nmanagers talk about being willing to reduce volume in order to\nunderwrite profitably, but we find that very few actually do so.\nPhil Liesche is an exception: if business makes sense, he writes\nit; if it doesnt, he rejects it.\nIt is our policy not to lay\noff people because of the large fluctuations in work load\nproduced by such voluntary volume changes.\nWe would rather have\nsome slack in the organization from time to time than keep\neveryone terribly busy writing business on which we are going to\nlose money.\nJack Ringwalt, the founder of National Indemnity\nCompany, instilled this underwriting discipline at the inception\nof the company, and Phil Liesche never has wavered in maintaining\nit.\nWe believe such strong-mindedness is as rare as it is sound\n- and absolutely essential to the running of a first-class\ncasualty insurance operation.\nJohn Seward continues to make solid progress at Home and\nAutomobile Insurance Company, in large part by significantly\nexpanding the marketing scope of that company in general\nliability lines.\nThese lines can be dynamite, but the record to\ndate is excellent and, in John McGowan and Paul Springman, we\nhave two cautious liability managers extending our capabilities.\nOur reinsurance division, led by George Young, continues to\ngive us reasonably satisfactory overall results after allowing\nfor investment income, but underwriting performance remains\nunsatisfactory.\nWe think the reinsurance business is a very\ntough business that is likely to get much tougher.\nIn fact, the\ninflux of capital into the business and the resulting softer\nprice levels for continually increasing exposures may well\nproduce disastrous results for many entrants (of which they may\nbe blissfully unaware until they are in over their heads; much\nreinsurance business involves an exceptionally long tail, a\ncharacteristic that allows catastrophic current loss experience\nto fester undetected for many years).\nIt will be hard for us to\nbe a whole lot smarter than the crowd and thus our reinsurance\nactivity may decline substantially during the projected prolonged\nperiod of extraordinary competition.\nThe Homestate operation was disappointing in 1979.\nExcellent results again were turned in by George Billings at\nTexas United Insurance Company, winner of the annual award for\nthe low loss ratio among Homestate companies, and Floyd Taylor at\nKansas Fire and Casualty Company.\nBut several of the other\noperations, particularly Cornhusker Casualty Company, our first\nand largest Homestate operation and historically a winner, had\npoor underwriting results which were accentuated by data\nprocessing, administrative and personnel problems.\nWe have made\nsome major mistakes in reorganizing our data processing\nactivities, and those mistakes will not be cured immediately or\nwithout cost.\nHowever, John Ringwalt has thrown himself into the\ntask of getting things straightened out and we have confidence\nthat he, aided by several strong people who recently have been\nbrought aboard, will succeed.\nOur performance in Workers Compensation was far, far better\nthan we had any right to expect at the beginning of 1979.\nWe had\na very favorable climate in California for the achievement of\ngood results but, beyond this, Milt Thornton at Cypress Insurance\nCompany and Frank DeNardo at National Indemnitys California\nWorkers Compensation operation both performed in a simply\noutstanding manner.\nWe have admitted - and with good reason -\nsome mistakes on the acquisition front, but the Cypress purchase\nhas turned out to be an absolute gem.\nMilt Thornton, like Phil\nLiesche, follows the policy of sticking with business that he\nunderstands and wants, without giving consideration to the impact\non volume.\nAs a result, he has an outstanding book of business\nand an exceptionally well functioning group of employees.\nFrank\nDeNardo has straightened out the mess he inherited in Los Angeles\nin a manner far beyond our expectations, producing savings\nmeasured in seven figures.\nHe now can begin to build on a sound\nbase.\nAt yearend we entered the specialized area of surety\nreinsurance under the management of Chet Noble.\nAt least\ninitially, this operation will be relatively small since our\npolicy will be to seek client companies who appreciate the need\nfor a long term partnership relationship with their reinsurers.\nWe are pleased by the quality of the insurers we have attracted,\nand hope to add several more of the best primary writers as our\nfinancial strength and stability become better known in the\nsurety field.\nThe conventional wisdom is that insurance underwriting\noverall will be poor in 1980, but that rates will start to firm\nin a year or so, leading to a turn in the cycle some time in\n1981.\nWe disagree with this view.\nPresent interest rates\nencourage the obtaining of business at underwriting loss levels\nformerly regarded as totally unacceptable.\nManagers decry the\nfolly of underwriting at a loss to obtain investment income, but\nwe believe that many will.\nThus we expect that competition will\ncreate a new threshold of tolerance for underwriting losses, and\nthat combined ratios will average higher in the future than in\nthe past.\nTo some extent, the day of reckoning has been postponed\nbecause of marked reduction in the frequency of auto accidents -\nprobably brought on in major part by changes in driving habits\ninduced by higher gas prices.\nIn our opinion, if the habits\nhadnt changed, auto insurance rates would have been very little\nhigher and underwriting results would have been much worse.\nThis\ndosage of serendipity wont last indefinitely.\nOur forecast is for an average combined ratio for the\nindustry in the 105 area over the next five years.\nWhile we have\na high degree of confidence that certain of our operations will\ndo considerably better than average, it will be a challenge to us\nto operate below the industry figure.\nYou can get a lot of\nsurprises in insurance.\nNevertheless, we believe that insurance can be a very good\nbusiness.\nIt tends to magnify, to an unusual degree, human\nmanagerial talent - or the lack of it.\nWe have a number of\nmanagers whose talent is both proven and growing. (And, in\naddition, we have a very large indirect interest in two truly\noutstanding management groups through our investments in SAFECO\nand GEICO.) Thus we expect to do well in insurance over a period\nof years.\nHowever, the business has the potential for really\nterrible results in a single specific year.\nIf accident\nfrequency should turn around quickly in the auto field, we, along\nwith others, are likely to experience such a year.\nInsurance Investments\nIn recent years we have written at length in this section\nabout our insurance equity investments.\nIn 1979 they continued\nto perform well, largely because the underlying companies in\nwhich we have invested, in practically all cases, turned in\noutstanding performances.\nRetained earnings applicable to our\ninsurance equity investments, not reported in our financial\nstatements, continue to mount annually and, in aggregate, now\ncome to a very substantial number.\nWe have faith that the\nmanagements of these companies will utilize those retained\nearnings effectively and will translate a dollar retained by them\ninto a dollar or more of subsequent market value for us.\nIn\npart, our unrealized gains reflect this process.\nBelow we show the equity investments which had a yearend\nmarket value of over $5 million:\nNo. of Sh.\nCompany\nCost\nMarket\n----------\n-------\n----------\n----------\n(000s omitted)\n289,700\nAffiliated Publications, Inc. ........... $\n2,821\n$\n8,800\n112,545\nAmerada Hess ............................\n2,861\n5,487\n246,450\nAmerican Broadcasting Companies, Inc. ...\n6,082\n9,673\n5,730,114\nGEICO Corp.

(Naturally, those views are much clearer and\ndefinite in retrospect; it would be fair for you to ask why we\nwerent writing about this subject last year.)\nOf course, we must hold significant amounts of bonds or\nother fixed dollar obligations in conjunction with our insurance\noperations.\nIn the last several years our net fixed dollar\ncommitments have been limited to the purchase of convertible\nbonds.\nWe believe that the conversion options obtained, in\neffect, give that portion of the bond portfolio a far shorter\naverage life than implied by the maturity terms of the issues\n(i.e., at an appropriate time of our choosing, we can terminate\nthe bond contract by conversion into stock).\nThis bond policy has given us significantly lower unrealized\nlosses than those experienced by the great majority of property\nand casualty insurance companies.\nWe also have been helped by\nour strong preference for equities in recent years that has kept\nour overall bond segment relatively low.\nNevertheless, we are\ntaking our lumps in bonds and feel that, in a sense, our mistakes\nshould be viewed less charitably than the mistakes of those who\nwent about their business unmindful of the developing problems.\nHarking back to our textile experience, we should have\nrealized the futility of trying to be very clever (via sinking\nfunds and other special type issues) in an area where the tide\nwas running heavily against us.\nWe have severe doubts as to whether a very long-term fixed-\ninterest bond, denominated in dollars, remains an appropriate\nbusiness contract in a world where the value of dollars seems\nalmost certain to shrink by the day.\nThose dollars, as well as\npaper creations of other governments, simply may have too many\nstructural weaknesses to appropriately serve as a unit of long\nterm commercial reference.\nIf so, really long bonds may turn out\nto be obsolete instruments and insurers who have bought those\nmaturities of 2010 or 2020 could have major and continuing\nproblems on their hands.\nWe, likewise, will be unhappy with our\nfifteen-year bonds and will annually pay a price in terms of\nearning power that reflects that mistake.\nSome of our convertible bonds appear exceptionally\nattractive to us, and have the same sort of earnings retention\nfactor (applicable to the stock into which they may be converted)\nthat prevails in our conventional equity portfolio.\nWe expect to\nmake money in these bonds (we already have, in a few cases) and\nhave hopes that our profits in this area may offset losses in\nstraight bonds.\nAnd, of course, there is the possibility that our present\nanalysis is much too negative.\nThe chances for very low rates of\ninflation are not nil.\nInflation is man-made; perhaps it can be\nman-mastered.\nThe threat which alarms us may also alarm\nlegislators and other powerful groups, prompting some appropriate\nresponse.\nFurthermore, present interest rates incorporate much higher\ninflation projections than those of a year or two ago.\nSuch\nrates may prove adequate or more than adequate to protect bond\nbuyers.\nWe even may miss large profits from a major rebound in\nbond prices.\nHowever, our unwillingness to fix a price now for a\npound of Sees candy or a yard of Berkshire cloth to be delivered\nin 2010 or 2020 makes us equally unwilling to buy bonds which set\na price on money now for use in those years.\nOverall, we opt for\nPolonius (slightly restated): Neither a short-term borrower nor\na long-term lender be.\nBanking\nThis will be the last year that we can report on the\nIllinois National Bank and Trust Company as a subsidiary of\nBerkshire Hathaway.\nTherefore, it is particularly pleasant to\nreport that, under Gene Abeggs and Pete Jeffreys management,\nthe bank broke all previous records and earned approximately 2.3%\non average assets last year, a level again over three times that\nachieved by the average major bank, and more than double that of\nbanks regarded as outstanding.\nThe record is simply\nextraordinary, and the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway owe a\nstanding ovation to Gene Abegg for the performance this year and\nevery year since our purchase in 1969.\nAs you know, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1969 requires\nthat we divest the bank by December 31, 1980.\nFor some years we\nhave expected to comply by effecting a spin-off during 1980.\nHowever, the Federal Reserve Board has taken the firm position\nthat if the bank is spun off, no officer or director of Berkshire\nHathaway can be an officer or director of the spun-off bank or\nbank holding company, even in a case such as ours in which one\nindividual would own over 40% of both companies.\nUnder these conditions, we are investigating the possible\nsale of between 80% and 100% of the stock of the bank.\nWe will\nbe most choosy about any purchaser, and our selection will not be\nbased solely on price.\nThe bank and its management have treated\nus exceptionally well and, if we have to sell, we want to be sure\nthat they are treated equally as well.\nA spin-off still is a\npossibility if a fair price along with a proper purchaser cannot\nbe obtained by early fall.\nHowever, you should be aware that we do not expect to be\nable to fully, or even in very large part, replace the earning\npower represented by the bank from the proceeds of the sale of\nthe bank.\nYou simply cant buy high quality businesses at the\nsort of price/earnings multiple likely to prevail on our bank\nsale.\nFinancial Reporting\nDuring 1979, NASDAQ trading was initiated in the stock of\nBerkshire Hathaway This means that the stock now is quoted on the\nOver-the-Counter page of the Wall Street journal under\nAdditional OTC Quotes.\nPrior to such listing, the Wall Street\njournal and the Dow-Jones news ticker would not report our\nearnings, even though such earnings were one hundred or more\ntimes the level of some companies whose reports they regularly\npicked up.\nNow, however, the Dow-Jones news ticker reports our\nquarterly earnings promptly after we release them and, in\naddition, both the ticker and the Wall Street journal report our\nannual earnings.\nThis solves a dissemination problem that had\nbothered us.\nIn some ways, our shareholder group is a rather unusual one,\nand this affects our manner of reporting to you.\nFor example, at\nthe end of each year about 98% of the shares outstanding are held\nby people who also were shareholders at the beginning of the\nyear.\nTherefore, in our annual report we build upon what we have\ntold you in previous years instead of restating a lot of\nmaterial.\nYou get more useful information this way, and we dont\nget bored.\nFurthermore, perhaps 90% of our shares are owned by\ninvestors for whom Berkshire is their largest security holding,\nvery often far and away the largest.\nMany of these owners are\nwilling to spend a significant amount of time with the annual\nreport, and we attempt to provide them with the same information\nwe would find useful if the roles were reversed.\nIn contrast, we include no narrative with our quarterly\nreports.\nOur owners and managers both have very long time-\nhorizons in regard to this business, and it is difficult to say\nanything new or meaningful each quarter about events of long-term\nsignificance.\nBut when you do receive a communication from us, it will\ncome from the fellow you are paying to run the business.\nYour\nChairman has a firm belief that owners are entitled to hear\ndirectly from the CEO as to what is going on and how he evaluates\nthe business, currently and prospectively.\nYou would demand that\nin a private company; you should expect no less in a public\ncompany.\nA once-a-year report of stewardship should not be\nturned over to a staff specialist or public relations consultant\nwho is unlikely to be in a position to talk frankly on a manager-\nto-owner basis.\nWe feel that you, as owners, are entitled to the same sort\nof reporting by your manager as we feel is owed to us at\nBerkshire Hathaway by managers of our business units.\nObviously,\nthe degree of detail must be different, particularly where\ninformation would be useful to a business competitor or the like.\nBut the general scope, balance, and level of candor should be\nsimilar.\nWe dont expect a public relations document when our\noperating managers tell us what is going on, and we dont feel\nyou should receive such a document.\nIn large part, companies obtain the shareholder constituency\nthat they seek and deserve.\nIf they focus their thinking and\ncommunications on short-term results or short-term stock market\nconsequences they will, in large part, attract shareholders who\nfocus on the same factors.\nAnd if they are cynical in their\ntreatment of investors, eventually that cynicism is highly likely\nto be returned by the investment community.\nPhil Fisher, a respected investor and author, once likened\nthe policies of the corporation in attracting shareholders to\nthose of a restaurant attracting potential customers.\nA\nrestaurant could seek a given clientele - patrons of fast foods,\nelegant dining, Oriental food, etc. - and eventually obtain an\nappropriate group of devotees.\nIf the job were expertly done,\nthat clientele, pleased with the service, menu, and price level\noffered, would return consistently.\nBut the restaurant could not\nchange its character constantly and end up with a happy and\nstable clientele.\nIf the business vacillated between French\ncuisine and take-out chicken, the result would be a revolving\ndoor of confused and dissatisfied customers.\nSo it is with corporations and the shareholder constituency\nthey seek.\nYou cant be all things to all men, simultaneously\nseeking different owners whose primary interests run from high\ncurrent yield to long-term capital growth to stock market\npyrotechnics, etc.\nThe reasoning of managements that seek large trading\nactivity in their shares puzzles us.\nIn effect, such managements\nare saying that they want a good many of the existing clientele\ncontinually to desert them in favor of new ones - because you\ncant add lots of new owners (with new expectations) without\nlosing lots of former owners.\nWe much prefer owners who like our service and menu and who\nreturn year after year.\nIt would be hard to find a better group\nto sit in the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder seats than those\nalready occupying them.\nSo we hope to continue to have a very\nlow turnover among our owners, reflecting a constituency that\nunderstands our operation, approves of our policies, and shares\nour expectations.\nAnd we hope to deliver on those expectations.\nProspects\nLast year we said that we expected operating earnings in\ndollars to improve but return on equity to decrease.\nThis turned\nout to be correct.\nOur forecast for 1980 is the same.\nIf we are\nwrong, it will be on the downside.\nIn other words, we are\nvirtually certain that our operating earnings expressed as a\npercentage of the new equity base of approximately $236 million,\nvaluing securities at cost, will decline from the 18.6% attained\nin 1979.\nThere is also a fair chance that operating earnings in\naggregate dollars will fall short of 1979; the outcome depends\npartly upon the date of disposition of the bank, partly upon the\ndegree of slippage in insurance underwriting profitability, and\npartly upon the severity of earnings problems in the savings and\nloan industry.\nWe continue to feel very good about our insurance equity\ninvestments.\nOver a period of years, we expect to develop very\nlarge and growing amounts of underlying earning power\nattributable to our fractional ownership of these companies.\nIn\nmost cases they are splendid businesses, splendidly managed,\npurchased at highly attractive prices.\nYour company is run on the principle of centralization of\nfinancial decisions at the top (the very top, it might be added),\nand rather extreme delegation of operating authority to a number\nof key managers at the individual company or business unit level.\nWe could just field a basketball team with our corporate\nheadquarters group (which utilizes only about 1500 square feet of\nspace).\nThis approach produces an occasional major mistake that\nmight have been eliminated or minimized through closer operating\ncontrols.\nBut it also eliminates large layers of costs and\ndramatically speeds decision-making.\nBecause everyone has a\ngreat deal to do, a very great deal gets done.\nMost important of\nall, it enables us to attract and retain some extraordinarily\ntalented individuals - people who simply cant be hired in the\nnormal course of events - who find working for Berkshire to be\nalmost identical to running their own show.\nWe have placed much trust in them - and their achievements\nhave far exceeded that trust.\nWarren E. Buffett, Chairman\nMarch 3, 1980",

    "text": "Chairman's Letter - 1980\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOperating earnings improved to $41.9 million in 1980 from\n$36.0 million in 1979, but return on beginning equity capital\n(with securities valued at cost) fell to 17.8% from 18.6%. We\nbelieve the latter yardstick to be the most appropriate measure\nof single-year managerial economic performance.\nInformed use of\nthat yardstick, however, requires an understanding of many\nfactors, including accounting policies, historical carrying\nvalues of assets, financial leverage, and industry conditions.\nIn your evaluation of our economic performance, we suggest\nthat two factors should receive your special attention - one of a\npositive nature peculiar, to a large extent, to our own\noperation, and one of a negative nature applicable to corporate\nperformance generally.\nLets look at the bright side first.\nNon-Controlled Ownership Earnings\nWhen one company owns part of another company, appropriate\naccounting procedures pertaining to that ownership interest must\nbe selected from one of three major categories.\nThe percentage\nof voting stock that is owned, in large part, determines which\ncategory of accounting principles should be utilized.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles require (subject to\nexceptions, naturally, as with our former bank subsidiary) full\nconsolidation of sales, expenses, taxes, and earnings of business\nholdings more than 50% owned.\nBlue Chip Stamps, 60% owned by\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc., falls into this category.\nTherefore,\nall Blue Chip income and expense items are included in full in\nBerkshires Consolidated Statement of Earnings, with the 40%\nownership interest of others in Blue Chips net earnings\nreflected in the Statement as a deduction for minority\ninterest.\nFull inclusion of underlying earnings from another class of\nholdings, companies owned 20% to 50% (usually called\ninvestees), also normally occurs.\nEarnings from such companies\n- for example, Wesco Financial, controlled by Berkshire but only\n48% owned - are included via a one-line entry in the owners\nStatement of Earnings.\nUnlike the over-50% category, all items\nof revenue and expense are omitted; just the proportional share\nof net income is included.\nThus, if Corporation A owns one-third\nof Corporation B, one-third of Bs earnings, whether or not\ndistributed by B, will end up in As earnings.\nThere are some\nmodifications, both in this and the over-50% category, for\nintercorporate taxes and purchase price adjustments, the\nexplanation of which we will save for a later day. (We know you\ncan hardly wait.)\nFinally come holdings representing less than 20% ownership\nof another corporations voting securities.\nIn these cases,\naccounting rules dictate that the owning companies include in\ntheir earnings only dividends received from such holdings.\nUndistributed earnings are ignored.\nThus, should we own 10% of\nCorporation X with earnings of $10 million in 1980, we would\nreport in our earnings (ignoring relatively minor taxes on\nintercorporate dividends) either (a) $1 million if X declared the\nfull $10 million in dividends; (b) $500,000 if X paid out 50%, or\n$5 million, in dividends; or (c) zero if X reinvested all\nearnings.\nWe impose this short - and over-simplified - course in\naccounting upon you because Berkshires concentration of\nresources in the insurance field produces a corresponding\nconcentration of its assets in companies in that third (less than\n20% owned) category.\nMany of these companies pay out relatively\nsmall proportions of their earnings in dividends.\nThis means\nthat only a small proportion of their current earning power is\nrecorded in our own current operating earnings.\nBut, while our\nreported operating earnings reflect only the dividends received\nfrom such companies, our economic well-being is determined by\ntheir earnings, not their dividends.\nOur holdings in this third category of companies have\nincreased dramatically in recent years as our insurance business\nhas prospered and as securities markets have presented\nparticularly attractive opportunities in the common stock area.\nThe large increase in such holdings, plus the growth of earnings\nexperienced by those partially-owned companies, has produced an\nunusual result; the part of our earnings that these companies\nretained last year (the part not paid to us in dividends)\nexceeded the total reported annual operating earnings of\nBerkshire Hathaway.\nThus, conventional accounting only allows\nless than half of our earnings iceberg to appear above the\nsurface, in plain view.\nWithin the corporate world such a result\nis quite rare; in our case it is likely to be recurring.\nOur own analysis of earnings reality differs somewhat from\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, particularly when those\nprinciples must be applied in a world of high and uncertain rates\nof inflation. (But its much easier to criticize than to improve\nsuch accounting rules.\nThe inherent problems are monumental.) We\nhave owned 100% of businesses whose reported earnings were not\nworth close to 100 cents on the dollar to us even though, in an\naccounting sense, we totally controlled their disposition. (The\ncontrol was theoretical.\nUnless we reinvested all earnings,\nmassive deterioration in the value of assets already in place\nwould occur.\nBut those reinvested earnings had no prospect of\nearning anything close to a market return on capital.) We have\nalso owned small fractions of businesses with extraordinary\nreinvestment possibilities whose retained earnings had an\neconomic value to us far in excess of 100 cents on the dollar.\nThe value to Berkshire Hathaway of retained earnings is not\ndetermined by whether we own 100%, 50%, 20% or 1% of the\nbusinesses in which they reside.\nRather, the value of those\nretained earnings is determined by the use to which they are put\nand the subsequent level of earnings produced by that usage.\nThis is true whether we determine the usage, or whether managers\nwe did not hire - but did elect to join - determine that usage.\n(Its the act that counts, not the actors.) And the value is in\nno way affected by the inclusion or non-inclusion of those\nretained earnings in our own reported operating earnings.\nIf a\ntree grows in a forest partially owned by us, but we dont record\nthe growth in our financial statements, we still own part of the\ntree.\nOur view, we warn you, is non-conventional.\nBut we would\nrather have earnings for which we did not get accounting credit\nput to good use in a 10%-owned company by a management we did not\npersonally hire, than have earnings for which we did get credit\nput into projects of more dubious potential by another management\n- even if we are that management.\n(We cant resist pausing here for a short commercial.\nOne\nusage of retained earnings we often greet with special enthusiasm\nwhen practiced by companies in which we have an investment\ninterest is repurchase of their own shares.\nThe reasoning is\nsimple: if a fine business is selling in the market place for far\nless than intrinsic value, what more certain or more profitable\nutilization of capital can there be than significant enlargement\nof the interests of all owners at that bargain price?\nThe\ncompetitive nature of corporate acquisition activity almost\nguarantees the payment of a full - frequently more than full\nprice when a company buys the entire ownership of another\nenterprise.\nBut the auction nature of security markets often\nallows finely-run companies the opportunity to purchase portions\nof their own businesses at a price under 50% of that needed to\nacquire the same earning power through the negotiated acquisition\nof another enterprise.)\nLong-Term Corporate Results\nAs we have noted, we evaluate single-year corporate\nperformance by comparing operating earnings to shareholders\nequity with securities valued at cost.\nOur long-term yardstick\nof performance, however, includes all capital gains or losses,\nrealized or unrealized.\nWe continue to achieve a long-term\nreturn on equity that considerably exceeds the average of our\nyearly returns.\nThe major factor causing this pleasant result is\na simple one: the retained earnings of those non-controlled\nholdings we discussed earlier have been translated into gains in\nmarket value.\nOf course, this translation of retained earnings into market\nprice appreciation is highly uneven (it goes in reverse some\nyears), unpredictable as to timing, and unlikely to materialize\non a precise dollar-for-dollar basis.\nAnd a silly purchase price\nfor a block of stock in a corporation can negate the effects of a\ndecade of earnings retention by that corporation.\nBut when\npurchase prices are sensible, some long-term market recognition\nof the accumulation of retained earnings almost certainly will\noccur.\nPeriodically you even will receive some frosting on the\ncake, with market appreciation far exceeding post-purchase\nretained earnings.\nIn the sixteen years since present management assumed\nresponsibility for Berkshire, book value per share with\ninsurance-held equities valued at market has increased from\n$19.46 to $400.80, or 20.5% compounded annually. (Youve done\nbetter: the value of the mineral content in the human body\ncompounded at 22% annually during the past decade.) It is\nencouraging, moreover, to realize that our record was achieved\ndespite many mistakes.\nThe list is too painful and lengthy to\ndetail here.\nBut it clearly shows that a reasonably competitive\ncorporate batting average can be achieved in spite of a lot of\nmanagerial strikeouts.\nOur insurance companies will continue to make large\ninvestments in well-run, favorably-situated, non-controlled\ncompanies that very often will pay out in dividends only small\nproportions of their earnings.\nFollowing this policy, we would\nexpect our long-term returns to continue to exceed the returns\nderived annually from reported operating earnings.\nOur\nconfidence in this belief can easily be quantified: if we were to\nsell the equities that we hold and replace them with long-term\ntax-free bonds, our reported operating earnings would rise\nimmediately by over $30 million annually.\nSuch a shift tempts us\nnot at all.\nSo much for the good news.\nResults for Owners\nUnfortunately, earnings reported in corporate financial\nstatements are no longer the dominant variable that determines\nwhether there are any real earnings for you, the owner.\nFor only\ngains in purchasing power represent real earnings on investment.\nIf you (a) forego ten hamburgers to purchase an investment; (b)\nreceive dividends which, after tax, buy two hamburgers; and (c)\nreceive, upon sale of your holdings, after-tax proceeds that will\nbuy eight hamburgers, then (d) you have had no real income from\nyour investment, no matter how much it appreciated in dollars.\nYou may feel richer, but you wont eat richer.\nHigh rates of inflation create a tax on capital that makes\nmuch corporate investment unwise - at least if measured by the\ncriterion of a positive real investment return to owners.\nThis\nhurdle rate the return on equity that must be achieved by a\ncorporation in order to produce any real return for its\nindividual owners - has increased dramatically in recent years.\nThe average tax-paying investor is now running up a down\nescalator whose pace has accelerated to the point where his\nupward progress is nil.\nFor example, in a world of 12% inflation a business earning\n20% on equity (which very few manage consistently to do) and\ndistributing it all to individuals in the 50% bracket is chewing\nup their real capital, not enhancing it. (Half of the 20% will go\nfor income tax; the remaining 10% leaves the owners of the\nbusiness with only 98% of the purchasing power they possessed at\nthe start of the year - even though they have not spent a penny\nof their earnings).\nThe investors in this bracket would\nactually be better off with a combination of stable prices and\ncorporate earnings on equity capital of only a few per cent.\nExplicit income taxes alone, unaccompanied by any implicit\ninflation tax, never can turn a positive corporate return into a\nnegative owner return. (Even if there were 90% personal income\ntax rates on both dividends and capital gains, some real income\nwould be left for the owner at a zero inflation rate.) But the\ninflation tax is not limited by reported income.\nInflation rates\nnot far from those recently experienced can turn the level of\npositive returns achieved by a majority of corporations into\nnegative returns for all owners, including those not required to\npay explicit taxes. (For example, if inflation reached 16%,\nowners of the 60% plus of corporate America earning less than\nthis rate of return would be realizing a negative real return -\neven if income taxes on dividends and capital gains were\neliminated.)\nOf course, the two forms of taxation co-exist and interact\nsince explicit taxes are levied on nominal, not real, income.\nThus you pay income taxes on what would be deficits if returns to\nstockholders were measured in constant dollars.\nAt present inflation rates, we believe individual owners in\nmedium or high tax brackets (as distinguished from tax-free\nentities such as pension funds, eleemosynary institutions, etc.)\nshould expect no real long-term return from the average American\ncorporation, even though these individuals reinvest the entire\nafter-tax proceeds from all dividends they receive.\nThe average\nreturn on equity of corporations is fully offset by the\ncombination of the implicit tax on capital levied by inflation\nand the explicit taxes levied both on dividends and gains in\nvalue produced by retained earnings.\nAs we said last year, Berkshire has no corporate solution to\nthe problem. (Well say it again next year, too.) Inflation does\nnot improve our return on equity.\nIndexing is the insulation that all seek against inflation.\nBut the great bulk (although there are important exceptions) of\ncorporate capital is not even partially indexed.\nOf course,\nearnings and dividends per share usually will rise if significant\nearnings are saved by a corporation; i.e., reinvested instead\nof paid as dividends.\nBut that would be true without inflation.\nA thrifty wage earner, likewise, could achieve regular annual\nincreases in his total income without ever getting a pay increase\n- if he were willing to take only half of his paycheck in cash\n(his wage dividend) and consistently add the other half (his\nretained earnings) to a savings account.\nNeither this high-\nsaving wage earner nor the stockholder in a high-saving\ncorporation whose annual dividend rate increases while its rate\nof return on equity remains flat is truly indexed.\nFor capital to be truly indexed, return on equity must rise,\ni.e., business earnings consistently must increase in proportion\nto the increase in the price level without any need for the\nbusiness to add to capital - including working capital -\nemployed.\n(Increased earnings produced by increased investment\ndont count.) Only a few businesses come close to exhibiting this\nability.\nAnd Berkshire Hathaway isnt one of them.\nWe, of course, have a corporate policy of reinvesting\nearnings for growth, diversity and strength, which has the\nincidental effect of minimizing the current imposition of\nexplicit taxes on our owners.\nHowever, on a day-by-day basis,\nyou will be subjected to the implicit inflation tax, and when you\nwish to transfer your investment in Berkshire into another form\nof investment, or into consumption, you also will face explicit\ntaxes.\nSources of Earnings\nThe table below shows the sources of Berkshires reported\nearnings.\nBerkshire owns about 60% of Blue Chip Stamps, which in\nturn owns 80% of Wesco Financial Corporation.\nThe table shows\naggregate earnings of the various business entities, as well as\nBerkshires share of those earnings.\nAll of the significant\ncapital gains and losses attributable to any of the business\nentities are aggregated in the realized securities gains figure\nat the bottom of the table, and are not included in operating\nearnings.\nOur calculation of operating earnings also excludes\nthe gain from sale of Mutuals branch offices.\nIn this respect\nit differs from the presentation in our audited financial\nstatements that includes this item in the calculation of\nEarnings Before Realized Investment Gain.\nNet Earnings\nEarnings Before Income Taxes\nAfter Tax\n--------------------------------------\n------------------\nTotal\nBerkshire Share\nBerkshire Share\n------------------\n------------------\n------------------\n(in thousands of dollars)\n1980\n1979\n1980\n1979\n1980\n1979\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nTotal Earnings - all entities $ 85,945\n$ 68,632\n$ 70,146\n$ 56,427\n$ 53,122\n$ 42,817\n========\n========\n========\n========\n========\n========\nEarnings from Operations:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting ............ $\n6,738\n$\n3,742\n$\n6,737\n$\n3,741\n$\n3,637\n$\n2,214\nNet Investment Income ...\n30,939\n24,224\n30,927\n24,216\n25,607\n20,106\nBerkshire-Waumbec Textiles\n(508)\n1,723\n(508)\n1,723\n202\n848\nAssociated Retail Stores ..\n2,440\n2,775\n2,440\n2,775\n1,169\n1,280\nSees Candies .............\n15,031\n12,785\n8,958\n7,598\n4,212\n3,448\nBuffalo Evening News ......\n(2,805)\n(4,617)\n(1,672)\n(2,744)\n(816)\n(1,333)\nBlue Chip Stamps - Parent\n7,699\n2,397\n4,588\n1,425\n3,060\n1,624\nIllinois National Bank ....\n5,324\n5,747\n5,200\n5,614\n4,731\n5,027\nWesco Financial - Parent ..\n2,916\n2,413\n1,392\n1,098\n1,044\n937\nMutual Savings and Loan ...\n5,814\n10,447\n2,775\n4,751\n1,974\n3,261\nPrecision Steel ...........\n2,833\n3,254\n1,352\n1,480\n656\n723\nInterest on Debt ..........\n(12,230)\n(8,248)\n(9,390)\n(5,860)\n(4,809)\n(2,900)\nOther .....................\n2,170\n1,342\n1,590\n996\n1,255\n753\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nTotal Earnings from\nOperations ........... $ 66,361\n$ 57,984\n$ 54,389\n$ 46,813\n$ 41,922\n$ 35,988\nMutual Savings and Loan -\nsale of branches .......\n5,873\n--\n2,803\n--\n1,293\n--\nRealized Securities Gain ....\n13,711\n10,648\n12,954\n9,614\n9,907\n6,829\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nTotal Earnings - all entities $ 85,945\n$ 68,632\n$ 70,146\n$ 56,427\n$ 53,122\n$ 42,817\n========\n========\n========\n========\n========\n========\nBlue Chip Stamps and Wesco are public companies with\nreporting requirements of their own.\nOn pages 40 to 53 of this\nreport we have reproduced the narrative reports of the principal\nexecutives of both companies, in which they describe 1980\noperations.\nWe recommend a careful reading, and suggest that you\nparticularly note the superb job done by Louie Vincenti and\nCharlie Munger in repositioning Mutual Savings and Loan.\nA copy\nof the full annual report of either company will be mailed to any\nBerkshire shareholder upon request to Mr. Robert H.

(If translated dollar for\ndollar into a combination of eventual market value gain and\ndividends, this figure would have to be reduced by a significant,\nbut not precisely determinable, amount of tax; perhaps 25% would\nbe a fair assumption.) Thus, we have a much larger economic\ninterest in the aluminum business than in practically any of the\noperating businesses we control and on which we report in more\ndetail.\nIf we maintain our holdings, our long-term performance\nwill be more affected by the future economics of the aluminum\nindustry than it will by direct operating decisions we make\nconcerning most companies over which we exercise managerial\ncontrol.\nGEICO Corp.\nOur largest non-controlled holding is 7.2 million shares of\nGEICO Corp., equal to about a 33% equity interest.\nNormally, an\ninterest of this magnitude (over 20%) would qualify as an\ninvestee holding and would require us to reflect a\nproportionate share of GEICOs earnings in our own.\nHowever, we\npurchased our GEICO stock pursuant to special orders of the\nDistrict of Columbia and New York Insurance Departments, which\nrequired that the right to vote the stock be placed with an\nindependent party.\nAbsent the vote, our 33% interest does not\nqualify for investee treatment. (Pinkertons is a similar\nsituation.)\nOf course, whether or not the undistributed earnings of\nGEICO are picked up annually in our operating earnings figure has\nnothing to do with their economic value to us, or to you as\nowners of Berkshire.\nThe value of these retained earnings will\nbe determined by the skill with which they are put to use by\nGEICO management.\nOn this score, we simply couldnt feel better.\nGEICO\nrepresents the best of all investment worlds - the coupling of a\nvery important and very hard to duplicate business advantage with\nan extraordinary management whose skills in operations are\nmatched by skills in capital allocation.\nAs you can see, our holdings cost us $47 million, with about\nhalf of this amount invested in 1976 and most of the remainder\ninvested in 1980.\nAt the present dividend rate, our reported\nearnings from GEICO amount to a little over $3 million annually.\nBut we estimate our share of its earning power is on the order of\n$20 million annually.\nThus, undistributed earnings applicable to\nthis holding alone may amount to 40% of total reported operating\nearnings of Berkshire.\nWe should emphasize that we feel as comfortable with GEICO\nmanagement retaining an estimated $17 million of earnings\napplicable to our ownership as we would if that sum were in our\nown hands.\nIn just the last two years GEICO, through repurchases\nof its own stock, has reduced the share equivalents it has\noutstanding from 34.2 million to 21.6 million, dramatically\nenhancing the interests of shareholders in a business that simply\ncant be replicated.\nThe owners could not have been better\nserved.\nWe have written in past reports about the disappointments\nthat usually result from purchase and operation of turnaround\nbusinesses.\nLiterally hundreds of turnaround possibilities in\ndozens of industries have been described to us over the years\nand, either as participants or as observers, we have tracked\nperformance against expectations.\nOur conclusion is that, with\nfew exceptions, when a management with a reputation for\nbrilliance tackles a business with a reputation for poor\nfundamental economics, it is the reputation of the business that\nremains intact.\nGEICO may appear to be an exception, having been turned\naround from the very edge of bankruptcy in 1976.\nIt certainly is\ntrue that managerial brilliance was needed for its resuscitation,\nand that Jack Byrne, upon arrival in that year, supplied that\ningredient in abundance.\nBut it also is true that the fundamental business advantage\nthat GEICO had enjoyed - an advantage that previously had\nproduced staggering success - was still intact within the\ncompany, although submerged in a sea of financial and operating\ntroubles.\nGEICO was designed to be the low-cost operation in an\nenormous marketplace (auto insurance) populated largely by\ncompanies whose marketing structures restricted adaptation.\nRun\nas designed, it could offer unusual value to its customers while\nearning unusual returns for itself.\nFor decades it had been run\nin just this manner.\nIts troubles in the mid-70s were not\nproduced by any diminution or disappearance of this essential\neconomic advantage.\nGEICOs problems at that time put it in a position analogous\nto that of American Express in 1964 following the salad oil\nscandal.\nBoth were one-of-a-kind companies, temporarily reeling\nfrom the effects of a fiscal blow that did not destroy their\nexceptional underlying economics.\nThe GEICO and American Express\nsituations, extraordinary business franchises with a localized\nexcisable cancer (needing, to be sure, a skilled surgeon), should\nbe distinguished from the true turnaround situation in which\nthe managers expect - and need - to pull off a corporate\nPygmalion.\nWhatever the appellation, we are delighted with our GEICO\nholding which, as noted, cost us $47 million.\nTo buy a similar\n$20 million of earning power in a business with first-class\neconomic characteristics and bright prospects would cost a\nminimum of $200 million (much more in some industries) if it had\nto be accomplished through negotiated purchase of an entire\ncompany.\nA 100% interest of that kind gives the owner the\noptions of leveraging the purchase, changing managements,\ndirecting cash flow, and selling the business.\nIt may also\nprovide some excitement around corporate headquarters (less\nfrequently mentioned).\nWe find it perfectly satisfying that the nature of our\ninsurance business dictates we buy many minority portions of\nalready well-run businesses (at prices far below our share of the\ntotal value of the entire business) that do not need management\nchange, re-direction of cash flow, or sale.\nThere arent many\nJack Byrnes in the managerial world, or GEICOs in the business\nworld.\nWhat could be better than buying into a partnership with\nboth of them?\nInsurance Industry Conditions\nThe insurance industrys underwriting picture continues to\nunfold about as we anticipated, with the combined ratio (see\ndefinition on page 37) rising from 100.6 in 1979 to an estimated\n103.5 in 1980.\nIt is virtually certain that this trend will\ncontinue and that industry underwriting losses will mount,\nsignificantly and progressively, in 1981 and 1982.\nTo understand\nwhy, we recommend that you read the excellent analysis of\nproperty-casualty competitive dynamics done by Barbara Stewart of\nChubb Corp. in an October 1980 paper. (Chubbs annual report\nconsistently presents the most insightful, candid and well-\nwritten discussion of industry conditions; you should get on the\ncompanys mailing list.) Mrs. Stewarts analysis may not be\ncheerful, but we think it is very likely to be accurate.\nAnd, unfortunately, a largely unreported but particularly\npernicious problem may well prolong and intensify the coming\nindustry agony.\nIt is not only likely to keep many insurers\nscrambling for business when underwriting losses hit record\nlevels - it is likely to cause them at such a time to redouble\ntheir efforts.\nThis problem arises from the decline in bond prices and the\ninsurance accounting convention that allows companies to carry\nbonds at amortized cost, regardless of market value.\nMany\ninsurers own long-term bonds that, at amortized cost, amount to\ntwo to three times net worth.\nIf the level is three times, of\ncourse, a one-third shrink from cost in bond prices - if it were\nto be recognized on the books - would wipe out net worth.\nAnd\nshrink they have.\nSome of the largest and best known property-\ncasualty companies currently find themselves with nominal, or\neven negative, net worth when bond holdings are valued at market.\nOf course their bonds could rise in price, thereby partially, or\nconceivably even fully, restoring the integrity of stated net\nworth.\nOr they could fall further. (We believe that short-term\nforecasts of stock or bond prices are useless.\nThe forecasts may\ntell you a great deal about the forecaster; they tell you nothing\nabout the future.)\nIt might strike some as strange that an insurance companys\nsurvival is threatened when its stock portfolio falls\nsufficiently in price to reduce net worth significantly, but that\nan even greater decline in bond prices produces no reaction at\nall.\nThe industry would respond by pointing out that, no matter\nwhat the current price, the bonds will be paid in full at\nmaturity, thereby eventually eliminating any interim price\ndecline.\nIt may take twenty, thirty, or even forty years, this\nargument says, but, as long as the bonds dont have to be sold,\nin the end theyll all be worth face value.\nOf course, if they\nare sold even if they are replaced with similar bonds offering\nbetter relative value - the loss must be booked immediately.\nAnd, just as promptly, published net worth must be adjusted\ndownward by the amount of the loss.\nUnder such circumstances, a great many investment options\ndisappear, perhaps for decades.\nFor example, when large\nunderwriting losses are in prospect, it may make excellent\nbusiness logic for some insurers to shift from tax-exempt bonds\ninto taxable bonds.\nUnwillingness to recognize major bond losses\nmay be the sole factor that prevents such a sensible move.\nBut the full implications flowing from massive unrealized\nbond losses are far more serious than just the immobilization of\ninvestment intellect.\nFor the source of funds to purchase and\nhold those bonds is a pool of money derived from policyholders\nand claimants (with changing faces) - money which, in effect, is\ntemporarily on deposit with the insurer.\nAs long as this pool\nretains its size, no bonds must be sold.\nIf the pool of funds\nshrinks - which it will if the volume of business declines\nsignificantly - assets must be sold to pay off the liabilities.\nAnd if those assets consist of bonds with big unrealized losses,\nsuch losses will rapidly become realized, decimating net worth in\nthe process.\nThus, an insurance company with a bond market value\nshrinkage approaching stated net worth (of which there are now\nmany) and also faced with inadequate rate levels that are sure to\ndeteriorate further has two options.\nOne option for management\nis to tell the underwriters to keep pricing according to the\nexposure involved - be sure to get a dollar of premium for every\ndollar of expense cost plus expectable loss cost.\nThe consequences of this directive are predictable: (a) with\nmost business both price sensitive and renewable annually, many\npolicies presently on the books will be lost to competitors in\nrather short order; (b) as premium volume shrinks significantly,\nthere will be a lagged but corresponding decrease in liabilities\n(unearned premiums and claims payable); (c) assets (bonds) must\nbe sold to match the decrease in liabilities; and (d) the\nformerly unrecognized disappearance of net worth will become\npartially recognized (depending upon the extent of such sales) in\nthe insurers published financial statements.\nVariations of this depressing sequence involve a smaller\npenalty to stated net worth.\nThe reaction of some companies at\n(c) would be to sell either stocks that are already carried at\nmarket values or recently purchased bonds involving less severe\nlosses.\nThis ostrich-like behavior - selling the better assets\nand keeping the biggest losers - while less painful in the short\nterm, is unlikely to be a winner in the long term.\nThe second option is much simpler: just keep writing\nbusiness regardless of rate levels and whopping prospective\nunderwriting losses, thereby maintaining the present levels of\npremiums, assets and liabilities - and then pray for a better\nday, either for underwriting or for bond prices.\nThere is much\ncriticism in the trade press of cash flow underwriting; i.e.,\nwriting business regardless of prospective underwriting losses in\norder to obtain funds to invest at current high interest rates.\nThis second option might properly be termed asset maintenance\nunderwriting - the acceptance of terrible business just to keep\nthe assets you now have.\nOf course you know which option will be selected.\nAnd it\nalso is clear that as long as many large insurers feel compelled\nto choose that second option, there will be no better day for\nunderwriting.\nFor if much of the industry feels it must maintain\npremium volume levels regardless of price adequacy, all insurers\nwill have to come close to meeting those prices.\nRight behind\nhaving financial problems yourself, the next worst plight is to\nhave a large group of competitors with financial problems that\nthey can defer by a sell-at-any-price policy.\nWe mentioned earlier that companies that were unwilling -\nfor any of a number of reasons, including public reaction,\ninstitutional pride, or protection of stated net worth - to sell\nbonds at price levels forcing recognition of major losses might\nfind themselves frozen in investment posture for a decade or\nlonger.\nBut, as noted, thats only half of the problem.\nCompanies that have made extensive commitments to long-term bonds\nmay have lost, for a considerable period of time, not only many\nof their investment options, but many of their underwriting\noptions as well.\nOur own position in this respect is satisfactory.\nWe\nbelieve our net worth, valuing bonds of all insurers at amortized\ncost, is the strongest relative to premium volume among all large\nproperty-casualty stockholder-owned groups.\nWhen bonds are\nvalued at market, our relative strength becomes far more\ndramatic. (But lest we get too puffed up, we remind ourselves\nthat our asset and liability maturities still are far more\nmismatched than we would wish and that we, too, lost important\nsums in bonds because your Chairman was talking when he should\nhave been acting.)\nOur abundant capital and investment flexibility will enable\nus to do whatever we think makes the most sense during the\nprospective extended period of inadequate pricing.\nBut troubles\nfor the industry mean troubles for us.\nOur financial strength\ndoesnt remove us from the hostile pricing environment now\nenveloping the entire property-casualty insurance industry.\nIt\njust gives us more staying power and more options.\nInsurance Operations\nThe National Indemnity managers, led by Phil Liesche with\nthe usual able assistance of Roland Miller and Bill Lyons, outdid\nthemselves in 1980.\nWhile volume was flat, underwriting margins\nrelative to the industry were at an all-time high.\nWe expect\ndecreased volume from this operation in 1981.\nBut its managers\nwill hear no complaints from corporate headquarters, nor will\nemployment or salaries suffer.\nWe enormously admire the National\nIndemnity underwriting discipline - embedded from origin by the\nfounder, Jack Ringwalt - and know that this discipline, if\nsuspended, probably could not be fully regained.\nJohn Seward at Home and Auto continues to make good progress\nin replacing a diminishing number of auto policies with volume\nfrom less competitive lines, primarily small-premium general\nliability.\nOperations are being slowly expanded, both\ngeographically and by product line, as warranted by underwriting\nresults.\nThe reinsurance business continues to reflect the excesses\nand problems of the primary writers.\nWorse yet, it has the\npotential for magnifying such excesses.\nReinsurance is\ncharacterized by extreme ease of entry, large premium payments in\nadvance, and much-delayed loss reports and loss payments.\nInitially, the morning mail brings lots of cash and few claims.\nThis state of affairs can produce a blissful, almost euphoric,\nfeeling akin to that experienced by an innocent upon receipt of\nhis first credit card.\nThe magnetic lure of such cash-generating characteristics,\ncurrently enhanced by the presence of high interest rates, is\ntransforming the reinsurance market into amateur night.\nWithout a super catastrophe, industry underwriting will be poor\nin the next few years.\nIf we experience such a catastrophe,\nthere could be a bloodbath with some companies not able to live\nup to contractual commitments.\nGeorge Young continues to do a\nfirst-class job for us in this business.\nResults, with\ninvestment income included, have been reasonably profitable.\nWe\nwill retain an active reinsurance presence but, for the\nforeseeable future, we expect no premium growth from this\nactivity.\nWe continue to have serious problems in the Homestate\noperation.\nFloyd Taylor in Kansas has done an outstanding job\nbut our underwriting record elsewhere is considerably below\naverage.\nOur poorest performer has been Insurance Company of\nIowa, at which large losses have been sustained annually since\nits founding in 1973.\nLate in the fall we abandoned underwriting\nin that state, and have merged the company into Cornhusker\nCasualty.\nThere is potential in the homestate concept, but much\nwork needs to be done in order to realize it.\nOur Workers Compensation operation suffered a severe loss\nwhen Frank DeNardo died last year at 37. Frank instinctively\nthought like an underwriter.\nHe was a superb technician and a\nfierce competitor; in short order he had straightened out major\nproblems at the California Workers Compensation Division of\nNational Indemnity.\nDan Grossman, who originally brought Frank\nto us, stepped in immediately after Franks death to continue\nthat operation, which now utilizes Redwood Fire and Casualty,\nanother Berkshire subsidiary, as the insuring vehicle.\nOur major Workers Compensation operation, Cypress Insurance\nCompany, run by Milt Thornton, continues its outstanding record.\nYear after year Milt, like Phil Liesche, runs an underwriting\noperation that far outpaces his competition.\nIn the industry he\nis admired and copied, but not matched.\nOverall, we look for a significant decline in insurance\nvolume in 1981 along with a poorer underwriting result.\nWe\nexpect underwriting experience somewhat superior to that of the\nindustry but, of course, so does most of the industry.\nThere\nwill be some disappointments.\nTextile and Retail Operations\nDuring the past year we have cut back the scope of our\ntextile business.\nOperations at Waumbec Mills have been\nterminated, reluctantly but necessarily.\nSome equipment was\ntransferred to New Bedford but most has been sold, or will be,\nalong with real estate.\nYour Chairman made a costly mistake in\nnot facing the realities of this situation sooner.\nAt New Bedford we have reduced the number of looms operated\nby about one-third, abandoning some high-volume lines in which\nproduct differentiation was insignificant.\nEven assuming\neverything went right - which it seldom did - these lines could\nnot generate adequate returns related to investment.\nAnd, over a\nfull industry cycle, losses were the most likely result.\nOur remaining textile operation, still sizable, has been\ndivided into a manufacturing and a sales division, each free to\ndo business independent of the other.\nThus, distribution\nstrengths and mill capabilities will not be wedded to each other.\nWe have more than doubled capacity in our most profitable textile\nsegment through a recent purchase of used 130-inch Saurer looms.\nCurrent conditions indicate another tough year in textiles, but\nwith substantially less capital employed in the operation.\nBen Rosners record at Associated Retail Stores continues to\namaze us.\nIn a poor retailing year, Associateds earnings\ncontinued excellent - and those earnings all were translated into\ncash.\nOn March 7, 1981 Associated will celebrate its 50th\nbirthday.\nBen has run the business (along with Leo Simon, his\npartner from 1931 to 1966) in each of those fifty years.\nDisposition of Illinois National Bank and Trust of Rockford\nOn December 31, 1980 we completed the exchange of 41,086\nshares of Rockford Bancorp Inc. (which owns 97.7% of Illinois\nNational Bank) for a like number of shares of Berkshire Hathaway\nInc.\nOur method of exchange allowed all Berkshire shareholders to\nmaintain their proportional interest in the Bank (except for me;\nI was permitted 80% of my proportional share).\nThey were thus\nguaranteed an ownership position identical to that they would\nhave attained had we followed a more conventional spinoff\napproach.\nTwenty-four shareholders (of our approximate 1300)\nchose this proportional exchange option.\nWe also allowed overexchanges, and thirty-nine additional\nshareholders accepted this option, thereby increasing their\nownership in the Bank and decreasing their proportional ownership\nin Berkshire.\nAll got the full amount of Bancorp stock they\nrequested, since the total shares desired by these thirty-nine\nholders was just slightly less than the number left available by\nthe remaining 1200-plus holders of Berkshire who elected not to\npart with any Berkshire shares at all.\nAs the exchanger of last\nresort, I took the small balance (3% of Bancorps stock).\nThese\nshares, added to shares I received from my basic exchange\nallotment (80% of normal), gave me a slightly reduced\nproportional interest in the Bank and a slightly enlarged\nproportional interest in Berkshire.\nManagement of the Bank is pleased with the outcome.\nBancorp\nwill operate as an inexpensive and uncomplicated holding company\nowned by 65 shareholders.\nAnd all of those shareholders will\nhave become Bancorp owners through a conscious affirmative\ndecision.\nFinancing\nIn August we sold $60 million of 12 3/4% notes due August 1,\n2005, with a sinking fund to begin in 1991.\nThe managing underwriters, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette\nSecurities Corporation, represented by Bill Fisher, and Chiles,\nHeider & Company, Inc., represented by Charlie Heider, did an\nabsolutely first-class job from start to finish of the financing.\nUnlike most businesses, Berkshire did not finance because of\nany specific immediate needs.\nRather, we borrowed because we\nthink that, over a period far shorter than the life of the loan,\nwe will have many opportunities to put the money to good use.\nThe most attractive opportunities may present themselves at a\ntime when credit is extremely expensive - or even unavailable.\nAt such a time we want to have plenty of financial firepower.\nOur acquisition preferences run toward businesses that\ngenerate cash, not those that consume it.\nAs inflation\nintensifies, more and more companies find that they must spend\nall funds they generate internally just to maintain their\nexisting physical volume of business.\nThere is a certain mirage-\nlike quality to such operations.\nHowever attractive the earnings\nnumbers, we remain leery of businesses that never seem able to\nconvert such pretty numbers into no-strings-attached cash.\nBusinesses meeting our standards are not easy to find. (Each\nyear we read of hundreds of corporate acquisitions; only a\nhandful would have been of interest to us.) And logical expansion\nof our present operations is not easy to implement.\nBut well\ncontinue to utilize both avenues in our attempts to further\nBerkshires growth.\nUnder all circumstances we plan to operate with plenty of\nliquidity, with debt that is moderate in size and properly\nstructured, and with an abundance of capital strength.\nOur\nreturn on equity is penalized somewhat by this conservative\napproach, but it is the only one with which we feel comfortable.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nGene Abegg, founder of our long-owned bank in Rockford, died\non July 2, 1980 at the age of 82.\nAs a friend, banker and\ncitizen, he was unsurpassed.\nYou learn a great deal about a person when you purchase a\nbusiness from him and he then stays on to run it as an employee\nrather than as an owner.\nBefore the purchase the seller knows\nthe business intimately, whereas you start from scratch.\nThe\nseller has dozens of opportunities to mislead the buyer - through\nomissions, ambiguities, and misdirection.\nAfter the check has\nchanged hands, subtle (and not so subtle) changes of attitude can\noccur and implicit understandings can evaporate.\nAs in the\ncourtship-marriage sequence, disappointments are not infrequent.\nFrom the time we first met, Gene shot straight 100% of the\ntime - the only behavior pattern he had within him.\nAt the\noutset of negotiations, he laid all negative factors face up on\nthe table; on the other hand, for years after the transaction was\ncompleted he would tell me periodically of some previously\nundiscussed items of value that had come with our purchase.\nThough he was already 71 years of age when he sold us the\nBank, Gene subsequently worked harder for us than he had for\nhimself.\nHe never delayed reporting a problem for a minute, but\nproblems were few with Gene.\nWhat else would you expect from a\nman who, at the time of the bank holiday in 1933, had enough cash\non the premises to pay all depositors in full?\nGene never forgot\nhe was handling other peoples money.\nThough this fiduciary\nattitude was always dominant, his superb managerial skills\nenabled the Bank to regularly achieve the top position nationally\nin profitability.\nGene was in charge of the Illinois National for close to\nfifty years - almost one-quarter of the lifetime of our country.\nGeorge Mead, a wealthy industrialist, brought him in from Chicago\nto open a new bank after a number of other banks in Rockford had\nfailed.\nMr. Mead put up the money and Gene ran the show.\nHis\ntalent for leadership soon put its stamp on virtually every major\ncivic activity in Rockford.\nDozens of Rockford citizens have told me over the years of\nhelp Gene extended to them.\nIn some cases this help was\nfinancial; in all cases it involved much wisdom, empathy and\nfriendship.\nHe always offered the same to me.\nBecause of our\nrespective ages and positions I was sometimes the junior partner,\nsometimes the senior.\nWhichever the relationship, it always was\na special one, and I miss it.\nWarren E.

    "text": "Chairman's Letter - 1981\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nFebruary 26, 1982\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOperating earnings of $39.7 million in 1981 amounted to\n15.2% of beginning equity capital (valuing securities at cost)\ncompared to 17.8% in 1980.\nOur new plan that allows stockholders\nto designate corporate charitable contributions (detailed later)\nreduced earnings by about $900,000 in 1981.\nThis program, which\nwe expect to continue subject to annual evaluation of our\ncorporate tax position, had not been initiated in 1980.\nNon-Controlled Ownership Earnings\nIn the 1980 annual report we discussed extensively the\nconcept of non-controlled ownership earnings, i.e., Berkshires\nshare of the undistributed earnings of companies we dont control\nor significantly influence but in which we, nevertheless, have\nimportant investments. (We will be glad to make available to new\nor prospective shareholders copies of that discussion or others\nfrom earlier reports to which we refer in this report.) No\nportion of those undistributed earnings is included in the\noperating earnings of Berkshire.\nHowever, our belief is that, in aggregate, those\nundistributed and, therefore, unrecorded earnings will be\ntranslated into tangible value for Berkshire shareholders just as\nsurely as if subsidiaries we control had earned, retained - and\nreported - similar earnings.\nWe know that this translation of non-controlled ownership\nearnings into corresponding realized and unrealized capital gains\nfor Berkshire will be extremely irregular as to time of\noccurrence.\nWhile market values track business values quite well\nover long periods, in any given year the relationship can gyrate\ncapriciously.\nMarket recognition of retained earnings also will\nbe unevenly realized among companies.\nIt will be disappointingly\nlow or negative in cases where earnings are employed non-\nproductively, and far greater than dollar-for-dollar of retained\nearnings in cases of companies that achieve high returns with\ntheir augmented capital.\nOverall, if a group of non-controlled\ncompanies is selected with reasonable skill, the group result\nshould be quite satisfactory.\nIn aggregate, our non-controlled business interests have\nmore favorable underlying economic characteristics than our\ncontrolled businesses.\nThats understandable; the area of choice\nhas been far wider.\nSmall portions of exceptionally good\nbusinesses are usually available in the securities markets at\nreasonable prices.\nBut such businesses are available for\npurchase in their entirety only rarely, and then almost always at\nhigh prices.\nGeneral Acquisition Behavior\nAs our history indicates, we are comfortable both with total\nownership of businesses and with marketable securities\nrepresenting small portions of businesses.\nWe continually look\nfor ways to employ large sums in each area. (But we try to avoid\nsmall commitments - If somethings not worth doing at all, its\nnot worth doing well.) Indeed, the liquidity requirements of our\ninsurance and trading stamp businesses mandate major investments\nin marketable securities.\nOur acquisition decisions will be aimed at maximizing real\neconomic benefits, not at maximizing either managerial domain or\nreported numbers for accounting purposes. (In the long run,\nmanagements stressing accounting appearance over economic\nsubstance usually achieve little of either.)\nRegardless of the impact upon immediately reportable\nearnings, we would rather buy 10% of Wonderful Business T at X\nper share than 100% of T at 2X per share.\nMost corporate\nmanagers prefer just the reverse, and have no shortage of stated\nrationales for their behavior.\nHowever, we suspect three motivations - usually unspoken -\nto be, singly or in combination, the important ones in most high-\npremium takeovers:\n(1) Leaders, business or otherwise, seldom are deficient in\nanimal spirits and often relish increased activity and\nchallenge.\nAt Berkshire, the corporate pulse never\nbeats faster than when an acquisition is in prospect.\n(2) Most organizations, business or otherwise, measure\nthemselves, are measured by others, and compensate their\nmanagers far more by the yardstick of size than by any\nother yardstick. (Ask a Fortune 500 manager where his\ncorporation stands on that famous list and, invariably,\nthe number responded will be from the list ranked by\nsize of sales; he may well not even know where his\ncorporation places on the list Fortune just as\nfaithfully compiles ranking the same 500 corporations by\nprofitability.)\n(3) Many managements apparently were overexposed in\nimpressionable childhood years to the story in which the\nimprisoned handsome prince is released from a toads\nbody by a kiss from a beautiful princess.\nConsequently,\nthey are certain their managerial kiss will do wonders\nfor the profitability of Company T(arget).\nSuch optimism is essential.\nAbsent that rosy view,\nwhy else should the shareholders of Company A(cquisitor)\nwant to own an interest in T at the 2X takeover cost\nrather than at the X market price they would pay if they\nmade direct purchases on their own?\nIn other words, investors can always buy toads at the\ngoing price for toads.\nIf investors instead bankroll\nprincesses who wish to pay double for the right to kiss\nthe toad, those kisses had better pack some real\ndynamite.\nWeve observed many kisses but very few\nmiracles.\nNevertheless, many managerial princesses\nremain serenely confident about the future potency of\ntheir kisses - even after their corporate backyards are\nknee-deep in unresponsive toads.\nIn fairness, we should acknowledge that some acquisition\nrecords have been dazzling.\nTwo major categories stand out.\nThe first involves companies that, through design or\naccident, have purchased only businesses that are particularly\nwell adapted to an inflationary environment.\nSuch favored\nbusiness must have two characteristics: (1) an ability to\nincrease prices rather easily (even when product demand is flat\nand capacity is not fully utilized) without fear of significant\nloss of either market share or unit volume, and (2) an ability to\naccommodate large dollar volume increases in business (often\nproduced more by inflation than by real growth) with only minor\nadditional investment of capital.\nManagers of ordinary ability,\nfocusing solely on acquisition possibilities meeting these tests,\nhave achieved excellent results in recent decades.\nHowever, very\nfew enterprises possess both characteristics, and competition to\nbuy those that do has now become fierce to the point of being\nself-defeating.\nThe second category involves the managerial superstars - men\nwho can recognize that rare prince who is disguised as a toad,\nand who have managerial abilities that enable them to peel away\nthe disguise.\nWe salute such managers as Ben Heineman at\nNorthwest Industries, Henry Singleton at Teledyne, Erwin Zaban at\nNational Service Industries, and especially Tom Murphy at Capital\nCities Communications (a real managerial twofer, whose\nacquisition efforts have been properly focused in Category 1 and\nwhose operating talents also make him a leader of Category 2).\nFrom both direct and vicarious experience, we recognize the\ndifficulty and rarity of these executives achievements. (So do\nthey; these champs have made very few deals in recent years, and\noften have found repurchase of their own shares to be the most\nsensible employment of corporate capital.)\nYour Chairman, unfortunately, does not qualify for Category\n2.\nAnd, despite a reasonably good understanding of the economic\nfactors compelling concentration in Category 1, our actual\nacquisition activity in that category has been sporadic and\ninadequate.\nOur preaching was better than our performance. (We\nneglected the Noah principle: predicting rain doesnt count,\nbuilding arks does.)\nWe have tried occasionally to buy toads at bargain prices\nwith results that have been chronicled in past reports.\nClearly\nour kisses fell flat.\nWe have done well with a couple of princes\n- but they were princes when purchased.\nAt least our kisses\ndidnt turn them into toads.\nAnd, finally, we have occasionally\nbeen quite successful in purchasing fractional interests in\neasily-identifiable princes at toad-like prices.\nBerkshire Acquisition Objectives\nWe will continue to seek the acquisition of businesses in\ntheir entirety at prices that will make sense, even should the\nfuture of the acquired enterprise develop much along the lines of\nits past.\nWe may very well pay a fairly fancy price for a\nCategory 1 business if we are reasonably confident of what we are\ngetting.\nBut we will not normally pay a lot in any purchase for\nwhat we are supposed to bring to the party - for we find that we\nordinarily dont bring a lot.\nDuring 1981 we came quite close to a major purchase\ninvolving both a business and a manager we liked very much.\nHowever, the price finally demanded, considering alternative uses\nfor the funds involved, would have left our owners worse off than\nbefore the purchase.\nThe empire would have been larger, but the\ncitizenry would have been poorer.\nAlthough we had no success in 1981, from time to time in the\nfuture we will be able to purchase 100% of businesses meeting our\nstandards.\nAdditionally, we expect an occasional offering of a\nmajor non-voting partnership as discussed under the Pinkertons\nheading on page 47 of this report.\nWe welcome suggestions\nregarding such companies where we, as a substantial junior\npartner, can achieve good economic results while furthering the\nlong-term objectives of present owners and managers.\nCurrently, we find values most easily obtained through the\nopen-market purchase of fractional positions in companies with\nexcellent business franchises and competent, honest managements.\nWe never expect to run these companies, but we do expect to\nprofit from them.\nWe expect that undistributed earnings from such companies\nwill produce full value (subject to tax when realized) for\nBerkshire and its shareholders.\nIf they dont, we have made\nmistakes as to either: (1) the management we have elected to\njoin; (2) the future economics of the business; or (3) the price\nwe have paid.\nWe have made plenty of such mistakes - both in the purchase\nof non-controlling and controlling interests in businesses.\nCategory (2) miscalculations are the most common.\nOf course, it\nis necessary to dig deep into our history to find illustrations\nof such mistakes - sometimes as deep as two or three months back.\nFor example, last year your Chairman volunteered his expert\nopinion on the rosy future of the aluminum business.\nSeveral\nminor adjustments to that opinion - now aggregating approximately\n180 degrees - have since been required.\nFor personal as well as more objective reasons, however, we\ngenerally have been able to correct such mistakes far more\nquickly in the case of non-controlled businesses (marketable\nsecurities) than in the case of controlled subsidiaries.\nLack of\ncontrol, in effect, often has turned out to be an economic plus.\nAs we mentioned last year, the magnitude of our non-recorded\nownership earnings has grown to the point where their total is\ngreater than our reported operating earnings.\nWe expect this\nsituation will continue.\nIn just four ownership positions in\nthis category - GEICO Corporation, General Foods Corporation, R.\nJ. Reynolds Industries, Inc. and The Washington Post Company -\nour share of undistributed and therefore unrecorded earnings\nprobably will total well over $35 million in 1982.\nThe\naccounting rules that entirely ignore these undistributed\nearnings diminish the utility of our annual return on equity\ncalculation, or any other single year measure of economic\nperformance.\nLong-Term Corporate Performance\nIn measuring long-term economic performance, equities held\nby our insurance subsidiaries are valued at market subject to a\ncharge reflecting the amount of taxes that would have to be paid\nif unrealized gains were actually realized.\nIf we are correct in\nthe premise stressed in the preceding section of this report, our\nunreported ownership earnings will find their way, irregularly\nbut inevitably, into our net worth.\nTo date, this has been the\ncase.\nAn even purer calculation of performance would involve a\nvaluation of bonds and non-insurance held equities at market.\nHowever, GAAP accounting does not prescribe this procedure, and\nthe added purity would change results only very slightly.\nShould\nany valuation difference widen to significant proportions, as it\nhas at most major insurance companies, we will report its effect\nto you.\nOn a GAAP basis, during the present managements term of\nseventeen years, book value has increased from $19.46 per share\nto $526.02 per share, or 21.1% compounded annually.\nThis rate of\nreturn number is highly likely to drift downward in future years.\nWe hope, however, that it can be maintained significantly above\nthe rate of return achieved by the average large American\ncorporation.\nOver half of the large gain in Berkshires net worth during\n1981 - it totaled $124 million, or about 31% - resulted from the\nmarket performance of a single investment, GEICO Corporation.\nIn\naggregate, our market gain from securities during the year\nconsiderably outstripped the gain in underlying business values.\nSuch market variations will not always be on the pleasant side.\nIn past reports we have explained how inflation has caused\nour apparently satisfactory long-term corporate performance to be\nillusory as a measure of true investment results for our owners.\nWe applaud the efforts of Federal Reserve Chairman Volcker and\nnote the currently more moderate increases in various price\nindices.\nNevertheless, our views regarding long-term\ninflationary trends are as negative as ever.\nLike virginity, a\nstable price level seems capable of maintenance, but not of\nrestoration.\nDespite the overriding importance of inflation in the\ninvestment equation, we will not punish you further with another\nfull recital of our views; inflation itself will be punishment\nenough. (Copies of previous discussions are available for\nmasochists.) But, because of the unrelenting destruction of\ncurrency values, our corporate efforts will continue to do a much\nbetter job of filling your wallet than of filling your stomach.\nEquity Value-Added\nAn additional factor should further subdue any residual\nenthusiasm you may retain regarding our long-term rate of return.\nThe economic case justifying equity investment is that, in\naggregate, additional earnings above passive investment returns -\ninterest on fixed-income securities - will be derived through the\nemployment of managerial and entrepreneurial skills in\nconjunction with that equity capital.\nFurthermore, the case says\nthat since the equity capital position is associated with greater\nrisk than passive forms of investment, it is entitled to higher\nreturns.\nA value-added bonus from equity capital seems natural\nand certain.\nBut is it?\nSeveral decades back, a return on equity of as\nlittle as 10% enabled a corporation to be classified as a good\nbusiness - i.e., one in which a dollar reinvested in the business\nlogically could be expected to be valued by the market at more\nthan one hundred cents.\nFor, with long-term taxable bonds\nyielding 5% and long-term tax-exempt bonds 3%, a business\noperation that could utilize equity capital at 10% clearly was\nworth some premium to investors over the equity capital employed.\nThat was true even though a combination of taxes on dividends and\non capital gains would reduce the 10% earned by the corporation\nto perhaps 6%-8% in the hands of the individual investor.\nInvestment markets recognized this truth.\nDuring that\nearlier period, American business earned an average of 11% or so\non equity capital employed and stocks, in aggregate, sold at\nvaluations far above that equity capital (book value), averaging\nover 150 cents on the dollar.\nMost businesses were good\nbusinesses because they earned far more than their keep (the\nreturn on long-term passive money).\nThe value-added produced by\nequity investment, in aggregate, was substantial.\nThat day is gone.\nBut the lessons learned during its\nexistence are difficult to discard.\nWhile investors and managers\nmust place their feet in the future, their memories and nervous\nsystems often remain plugged into the past.\nIt is much easier\nfor investors to utilize historic p/e ratios or for managers to\nutilize historic business valuation yardsticks than it is for\neither group to rethink their premises daily.\nWhen change is\nslow, constant rethinking is actually undesirable; it achieves\nlittle and slows response time.\nBut when change is great,\nyesterdays assumptions can be retained only at great cost.\nAnd\nthe pace of economic change has become breathtaking.\nDuring the past year, long-term taxable bond yields exceeded\n16% and long-term tax-exempts 14%.\nThe total return achieved\nfrom such tax-exempts, of course, goes directly into the pocket\nof the individual owner.\nMeanwhile, American business is\nproducing earnings of only about 14% on equity.\nAnd this 14%\nwill be substantially reduced by taxation before it can be banked\nby the individual owner.\nThe extent of such shrinkage depends\nupon the dividend policy of the corporation and the tax rates\napplicable to the investor.\nThus, with interest rates on passive investments at late\n1981 levels, a typical American business is no longer worth one\nhundred cents on the dollar to owners who are individuals. (If\nthe business is owned by pension funds or other tax-exempt\ninvestors, the arithmetic, although still unenticing, changes\nsubstantially for the better.) Assume an investor in a 50% tax\nbracket; if our typical company pays out all earnings, the income\nreturn to the investor will be equivalent to that from a 7% tax-\nexempt bond.\nAnd, if conditions persist - if all earnings are\npaid out and return on equity stays at 14% - the 7% tax-exempt\nequivalent to the higher-bracket individual investor is just as\nfrozen as is the coupon on a tax-exempt bond.\nSuch a perpetual\n7% tax-exempt bond might be worth fifty cents on the dollar as\nthis is written.\nIf, on the other hand, all earnings of our typical American\nbusiness are retained and return on equity again remains\nconstant, earnings will grow at 14% per year.\nIf the p/e ratio\nremains constant, the price of our typical stock will also grow\nat 14% per year.\nBut that 14% is not yet in the pocket of the\nshareholder.\nPutting it there will require the payment of a\ncapital gains tax, presently assessed at a maximum rate of 20%.\nThis net return, of course, works out to a poorer rate of return\nthan the currently available passive after-tax rate.\nUnless passive rates fall, companies achieving 14% per year\ngains in earnings per share while paying no cash dividend are an\neconomic failure for their individual shareholders.\nThe returns\nfrom passive capital outstrip the returns from active capital.\nThis is an unpleasant fact for both investors and corporate\nmanagers and, therefore, one they may wish to ignore.\nBut facts\ndo not cease to exist, either because they are unpleasant or\nbecause they are ignored.\nMost American businesses pay out a significant portion of\ntheir earnings and thus fall between the two examples.\nAnd most\nAmerican businesses are currently bad businesses economically -\nproducing less for their individual investors after-tax than the\ntax-exempt passive rate of return on money.\nOf course, some\nhigh-return businesses still remain attractive, even under\npresent conditions.\nBut American equity capital, in aggregate,\nproduces no value-added for individual investors.\nIt should be stressed that this depressing situation does\nnot occur because corporations are jumping, economically, less\nhigh than previously.\nIn fact, they are jumping somewhat higher:\nreturn on equity has improved a few points in the past decade.\nBut the crossbar of passive return has been elevated much faster.\nUnhappily, most companies can do little but hope that the bar\nwill be lowered significantly; there are few industries in which\nthe prospects seem bright for substantial gains in return on\nequity.\nInflationary experience and expectations will be major (but\nnot the only) factors affecting the height of the crossbar in\nfuture years.\nIf the causes of long-term inflation can be\ntempered, passive returns are likely to fall and the intrinsic\nposition of American equity capital should significantly improve.\nMany businesses that now must be classified as economically bad\nwould be restored to the good category under such\ncircumstances.\nA further, particularly ironic, punishment is inflicted by\nan inflationary environment upon the owners of the bad\nbusiness.\nTo continue operating in its present mode, such a low-\nreturn business usually must retain much of its earnings - no\nmatter what penalty such a policy produces for shareholders.\nReason, of course, would prescribe just the opposite policy.\nAn individual, stuck with a 5% bond with many years to run before\nmaturity, does not take the coupons from that bond and pay one\nhundred cents on the dollar for more 5% bonds while similar bonds\nare available at, say, forty cents on the dollar.\nInstead, he\ntakes those coupons from his low-return bond and - if inclined to\nreinvest - looks for the highest return with safety currently\navailable.\nGood money is not thrown after bad.\nWhat makes sense for the bondholder makes sense for the\nshareholder.\nLogically, a company with historic and prospective\nhigh returns on equity should retain much or all of its earnings\nso that shareholders can earn premium returns on enhanced\ncapital.\nConversely, low returns on corporate equity would\nsuggest a very high dividend payout so that owners could direct\ncapital toward more attractive areas. (The Scriptures concur.\nIn\nthe parable of the talents, the two high-earning servants are\nrewarded with 100% retention of earnings and encouraged to expand\ntheir operations.\nHowever, the non-earning third servant is not\nonly chastised - wicked and slothful - but also is required to\nredirect all of his capital to the top performer.\nMatthew 25:\n14-30)\nBut inflation takes us through the looking glass into the\nupside-down world of Alice in Wonderland.\nWhen prices\ncontinuously rise, the bad business must retain every nickel\nthat it can.\nNot because it is attractive as a repository for\nequity capital, but precisely because it is so unattractive, the\nlow-return business must follow a high retention policy.\nIf it\nwishes to continue operating in the future as it has in the past\n- and most entities, including businesses, do - it simply has no\nchoice.\nFor inflation acts as a gigantic corporate tapeworm.\nThat\ntapeworm preemptively consumes its requisite daily diet of\ninvestment dollars regardless of the health of the host organism.\nWhatever the level of reported profits (even if nil), more\ndollars for receivables, inventory and fixed assets are\ncontinuously required by the business in order to merely match\nthe unit volume of the previous year.\nThe less prosperous the\nenterprise, the greater the proportion of available sustenance\nclaimed by the tapeworm.\nUnder present conditions, a business earning 8% or 10% on\nequity often has no leftovers for expansion, debt reduction or\nreal dividends.\nThe tapeworm of inflation simply cleans the\nplate. (The low-return companys inability to pay dividends,\nunderstandably, is often disguised.\nCorporate America\nincreasingly is turning to dividend reinvestment plans, sometimes\neven embodying a discount arrangement that all but forces\nshareholders to reinvest.\nOther companies sell newly issued\nshares to Peter in order to pay dividends to Paul.\nBeware of\ndividends that can be paid out only if someone promises to\nreplace the capital distributed.)\nBerkshire continues to retain its earnings for offensive,\nnot defensive or obligatory, reasons.\nBut in no way are we\nimmune from the pressures that escalating passive returns exert\non equity capital.\nWe continue to clear the crossbar of after-\ntax passive return - but barely.\nOur historic 21% return - not\nat all assured for the future - still provides, after the current\ncapital gain tax rate (which we expect to rise considerably in\nfuture years), a modest margin over current after-tax rates on\npassive money.\nIt would be a bit humiliating to have our\ncorporate value-added turn negative.\nBut it can happen here as\nit has elsewhere, either from events outside anyones control or\nfrom poor relative adaptation on our part.\nSources of Reported Earnings\nThe table below shows the sources of Berkshires reported\nearnings.\nBerkshire owns about 60% of Blue Chip Stamps which, in\nturn, owns 80% of Wesco Financial Corporation.\nThe table\ndisplays aggregate operating earnings of the various business\nentities, as well as Berkshires share of those earnings.\nAll of\nthe significant gains and losses attributable to unusual sales of\nassets by any of the business entities are aggregated with\nsecurities transactions in the line near the bottom of the table\nand are not included in operating earnings.\nNet Earnings\nEarnings Before Income Taxes\nAfter Tax\n--------------------------------------\n------------------\nTotal\nBerkshire Share\nBerkshire Share\n------------------\n------------------\n------------------\n1981\n1980\n1981\n1980\n1981\n1980\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n(000s omitted)\nOperating Earnings:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting ............ $\n1,478\n$\n6,738\n$\n1,478\n$\n6,737\n$\n798\n$ 3,637\nNet Investment Income ...\n38,823\n30,939\n38,823\n30,927\n32,401\n25,607\nBerkshire-Waumbec Textiles\n(2,669)\n(508)\n(2,669)\n(508)\n(1,493)\n202\nAssociated Retail Stores ..\n1,763\n2,440\n1,763\n2,440\n759\n1,169\nSees Candies .............\n21,891\n15,475\n13,046\n9,223\n6,289\n4,459\nBuffalo Evening News ......\n(1,057)\n(2,777)\n(630)\n(1,655)\n(276)\n(800)\nBlue Chip Stamps - Parent\n3,642\n7,699\n2,171\n4,588\n2,134\n3,060\nWesco Financial - Parent ..\n4,495\n2,916\n2,145\n1,392\n1,590\n1,044\nMutual Savings and Loan ...\n1,605\n5,814\n766\n2,775\n1,536\n1,974\nPrecision Steel ...........\n3,453\n2,833\n1,648\n1,352\n841\n656\nInterest on Debt ..........\n(14,656)\n(12,230)\n(12,649)\n(9,390)\n(6,671)\n(4,809)\nOther* ....................\n1,895\n1,698\n1,344\n1,308\n1,513\n992\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nSub-total - Continuing\nOperations ............. $ 60,663\n$ 61,037\n$ 47,236\n$ 49,189\n$ 39,421\n$ 37,191\nIllinois National Bank** ..\n--\n5,324\n--\n5,200\n--\n4,731\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nOperating Earnings ..........\n60,663\n66,361\n47,236\n54,389\n39,421\n41,922\nSales of securities and\nunusual sales of assets ..\n37,801\n19,584\n33,150\n15,757\n23,183\n11,200\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nTotal Earnings - all entities $ 98,464\n$ 85,945\n$ 80,386\n$ 70,146\n$ 62,604\n$ 53,122\n========\n========\n========\n========\n========\n========\n*Amortization of intangibles arising in accounting for\npurchases of businesses (i.e. Sees, Mutual and Buffalo\nEvening News) is reflected in the category designated as\nOther.\n**Berkshire divested itself of its ownership of the Illinois\nNational Bank on December 31, 1980.\nBlue Chip Stamps and Wesco are public companies with\nreporting requirements of their own.\nOn pages 38-50 of this\nreport we have reproduced the narrative reports of the principal\nexecutives of both companies, in which they describe 1981\noperations.\nA copy of the full annual report of either company\nwill be mailed to any Berkshire shareholder upon request to Mr.\nRobert H.

a ratio below\n100 indicates an underwriting profit, and one above 100 indicates\na loss.\nYearly Change\nYearly Change\nCombined Ratio\nin Premium\nin Premium\nafter Policy-\nWritten (%)\nEarned (%)\nholder Dividends\n-------------\n-------------\n----------------\n1972 ...............\n10.2\n10.9\n96.2\n1973 ...............\n8.0\n8.8\n99.2\n1974 ...............\n6.2\n6.9\n105.4\n1975 ...............\n11.0\n9.6\n107.9\n1976 ...............\n21.9\n19.4\n102.4\n1977 ...............\n19.8\n20.5\n97.2\n1978 ...............\n12.8\n14.3\n97.5\n1979 ...............\n10.3\n10.4\n100.6\n1980 ...............\n6.0\n7.8\n103.1\n1981 ...............\n3.6\n4.1\n105.7\nSource:\nBests Aggregates and Averages.\nAs Pogo would say, The future isnt what it used to be.\nCurrent pricing practices promise devastating results,\nparticularly if the respite from major natural disasters that the\nindustry has enjoyed in recent years should end.\nFor\nunderwriting experience has been getting worse in spite of good\nluck, not because of bad luck.\nIn recent years hurricanes have\nstayed at sea and motorists have reduced their driving.\nThey\nwont always be so obliging.\nAnd, of course the twin inflations, monetary and social\n(the tendency of courts and juries to stretch the coverage of\npolicies beyond what insurers, relying upon contract terminology\nand precedent, had expected), are unstoppable.\nCosts of\nrepairing both property and people - and the extent to which\nthese repairs are deemed to be the responsibility of the insurer\n- will advance relentlessly.\nAbsent any bad luck (catastrophes, increased driving, etc.),\nan immediate industry volume gain of at least 10% per year\nprobably is necessary to stabilize the record level of\nunderwriting losses that will automatically prevail in mid-1982.\n(Most underwriters expect incurred losses in aggregate to rise at\nleast 10% annually; each, of course, counts on getting less than\nhis share.) Every percentage point of annual premium growth below\nthe 10% equilibrium figure quickens the pace of deterioration.\nQuarterly data in 1981 underscore the conclusion that a terrible\nunderwriting picture is worsening at an accelerating rate.\nIn the 1980 annual report we discussed the investment\npolicies that have destroyed the integrity of many insurers\nbalance sheets, forcing them to abandon underwriting discipline\nand write business at any price in order to avoid negative cash\nflow.\nIt was clear that insurers with large holdings of bonds\nvalued, for accounting purposes, at nonsensically high prices\nwould have little choice but to keep the money revolving by\nselling large numbers of policies at nonsensically low prices.\nSuch insurers necessarily fear a major decrease in volume more\nthan they fear a major underwriting loss.\nBut, unfortunately, all insurers are affected; its\ndifficult to price much differently than your most threatened\ncompetitor.\nThis pressure continues unabated and adds a new\nmotivation to the others that drive many insurance managers to\npush for business; worship of size over profitability, and the\nfear that market share surrendered never can be regained.\nWhatever the reasons, we believe it is true that virtually\nno major property-casualty insurer - despite protests by the\nentire industry that rates are inadequate and great selectivity\nshould be exercised - has been willing to turn down business to\nthe point where cash flow has turned significantly negative.\nAbsent such a willingness, prices will remain under severe\npressure.\nCommentators continue to talk of the underwriting cycle,\nusually implying a regularity of rhythm and a relatively constant\nmidpoint of profitability Our own view is different.\nWe believe\nthat very large, although obviously varying, underwriting losses\nwill be the norm for the industry, and that the best underwriting\nyears in the future decade may appear substandard against the\naverage year of the past decade.\nWe have no magic formula to insulate our controlled\ninsurance companies against this deteriorating future.\nOur\nmanagers, particularly Phil Liesche, Bill Lyons, Roland Miller,\nFloyd Taylor and Milt Thornton, have done a magnificent job of\nswimming against the tide.\nWe have sacrificed much volume, but\nhave maintained a substantial underwriting superiority in\nrelation to industry-wide results.\nThe outlook at Berkshire is\nfor continued low volume.\nOur financial position offers us\nmaximum flexibility, a very rare condition in the property-\ncasualty insurance industry.\nAnd, at some point, should fear\never prevail throughout the industry, our financial strength\ncould become an operational asset of immense value.\nWe believe that GEICO Corporation, our major non-controlled\nbusiness operating in this field, is, by virtue of its extreme\nand improving operating efficiency, in a considerably more\nprotected position than almost any other major insurer.\nGEICO is\na brilliantly run implementation of a very important business\nidea.\nShareholder Designated Contributions\nOur new program enabling shareholders to designate the\nrecipients of corporate charitable contributions was greeted with\nextraordinary enthusiasm.\nA copy of the letter sent October 14,\n1981 describing this program appears on pages 51-53.\nOf 932,206\nshares eligible for participation (shares where the name of the\nactual owner appeared on our stockholder record), 95.6%\nresponded.\nEven excluding Buffet-related shares, the response\ntopped 90%.\nIn addition, more than 3% of our shareholders voluntarily\nwrote letters or notes, all but one approving of the program.\nBoth the level of participation and of commentary surpass any\nshareholder response we have witnessed, even when such response\nhas been intensively solicited by corporate staff and highly paid\nprofessional proxy organizations.\nIn contrast, your\nextraordinary level of response occurred without even the nudge\nof a company-provided return envelope.\nThis self-propelled\nbehavior speaks well for the program, and speaks well for our\nshareholders.\nApparently the owners of our corporation like both\npossessing and exercising the ability to determine where gifts of\ntheir funds shall be made.\nThe father-knows-best school of\ncorporate governance will be surprised to find that none of our\nshareholders sent in a designation sheet with instructions that\nthe officers of Berkshire - in their superior wisdom, of course -\nmake the decision on charitable funds applicable to his shares.\nNor did anyone suggest that his share of our charitable funds be\nused to match contributions made by our corporate directors to\ncharities of the directors choice (a popular, proliferating and\nnon-publicized policy at many large corporations).\nAll told, $1,783,655 of shareholder-designed contributions\nwere distributed to about 675 charities.\nIn addition, Berkshire\nand subsidiaries continue to make certain contributions pursuant\nto local level decisions made by our operating managers.\nThere will be some years, perhaps two or three out of ten,\nwhen contributions by Berkshire will produce substandard tax\ndeductions - or none at all.\nIn those years we will not effect\nour shareholder designated charitable program.\nIn all other\nyears we expect to inform you about October 10th of the amount\nper share that you may designate.\nA reply form will accompany\nthe notice, and you will be given about three weeks to respond\nwith your designation.\nTo qualify, your shares must be\nregistered in your own name or the name of an owning trust,\ncorporation, partnership or estate, if applicable, on our\nstockholder list of September 30th, or the Friday preceding if\nsuch date falls on a Saturday or Sunday.\nOur only disappointment with this program in 1981 was that\nsome of our shareholders, through no fault of their own, missed\nthe opportunity to participate.\nThe Treasury Department ruling\nallowing us to proceed without tax uncertainty was received early\nin October.\nThe ruling did not cover participation by\nshareholders whose stock was registered in the name of nominees,\nsuch as brokers, and additionally required that the owners of all\ndesignating shares make certain assurances to Berkshire.\nThese\nassurances could not be given us in effective form by nominee\nholders.\nUnder these circumstances, we attempted to communicate with\nall of our owners promptly (via the October 14th letter) so that,\nif they wished, they could prepare themselves to participate by\nthe November 13th record date.\nIt was particularly important\nthat this information be communicated promptly to stockholders\nwhose holdings were in nominee name, since they would not be\neligible unless they took action to re-register their shares\nbefore the record date.\nUnfortunately, communication to such non-record shareholders\ncould take place only through the nominees.\nWe therefore\nstrongly urged those nominees, mostly brokerage houses, to\npromptly transmit our letter to the real owners.\nWe explained\nthat their failure to do so could deprive such owners of an\nimportant benefit.\nThe results from our urgings would not strengthen the case\nfor private ownership of the U.S. Postal Service.\nMany of our\nshareholders never heard from their brokers (as some shareholders\ntold us after reading news accounts of the program).\nOthers were\nforwarded our letter too late for action.\nOne of the largest brokerage houses claiming to hold stock\nfor sixty of its clients (about 4% of our shareholder\npopulation), apparently transmitted our letter about three weeks\nafter receipt - too late for any of the sixty to participate.\n(Such lassitude did not pervade all departments of that firm; it\nbilled Berkshire for mailing services within six days of that\nbelated and ineffectual action.)\nWe recite such horror stories for two reasons: (1) if you\nwish to participate in future designated contribution programs,\nbe sure to have your stock registered in your name well before\nSeptember 30th; and (2) even if you dont care to participate and\nprefer to leave your stock in nominee form, it would be wise to\nhave at least one share registered in your own name.\nBy so\ndoing, you can be sure that you will be notified of any important\ncorporate news at the same time as all other shareholders.\nThe designated-contributions idea, along with many other\nideas that have turned out well for us, was conceived by Charlie\nMunger, Vice Chairman of Berkshire and Chairman of Blue Chip.\nIrrespective of titles, Charlie and I work as partners in\nmanaging all controlled companies.\nTo almost a sinful degree, we\nenjoy our work as managing partners.\nAnd we enjoy having you as\nour financial partners.\nWarren E.

    "text": "Chairman's Letter - 1982\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nMarch 3, 1983\nTo the Stockholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOperating earnings of $31.5 million in 1982 amounted to only\n9.8% of beginning equity capital (valuing securities at cost),\ndown from 15.2% in 1981 and far below our recent high of 19.4% in\n1978.\nThis decline largely resulted from:\n(1) a significant deterioration in insurance underwriting\nresults;\n(2) a considerable expansion of equity capital without a\ncorresponding growth in the businesses we operate\ndirectly; and\n(3) a continually-enlarging commitment of our resources to\ninvestment in partially-owned, nonoperated businesses;\naccounting rules dictate that a major part of our\npro-rata share of earnings from such businesses must be\nexcluded from Berkshires reported earnings.\nIt was only a few years ago that we told you that the\noperating earnings/equity capital percentage, with proper\nallowance for a few other variables, was the most important\nyardstick of single-year managerial performance.\nWhile we still\nbelieve this to be the case with the vast majority of companies,\nwe believe its utility in our own case has greatly diminished.\nYou should be suspicious of such an assertion.\nYardsticks seldom\nare discarded while yielding favorable readings.\nBut when\nresults deteriorate, most managers favor disposition of the\nyardstick rather than disposition of the manager.\nTo managers faced with such deterioration, a more flexible\nmeasurement system often suggests itself: just shoot the arrow of\nbusiness performance into a blank canvas and then carefully draw\nthe bullseye around the implanted arrow.\nWe generally believe in\npre-set, long-lived and small bullseyes.\nHowever, because of the\nimportance of item (3) above, further explained in the following\nsection, we believe our abandonment of the operating\nearnings/equity capital bullseye to be warranted.\nNon-Reported Ownership Earnings\nThe appended financial statements reflect accounting\nearnings that generally include our proportionate share of\nearnings from any underlying business in which our ownership is\nat least 20%.\nBelow the 20% ownership figure, however, only our\nshare of dividends paid by the underlying business units is\nincluded in our accounting numbers; undistributed earnings of\nsuch less-than-20%-owned businesses are totally ignored.\nThere are a few exceptions to this rule; e.g., we own about\n35% of GEICO Corporation but, because we have assigned our voting\nrights, the company is treated for accounting purposes as a less-\nthan-20% holding.\nThus, dividends received from GEICO in 1982 of\n$3.5 million after tax are the only item included in our\naccountingearnings.\nAn additional $23 million that represents\nour share of GEICOs undistributed operating earnings for 1982 is\ntotally excluded from our reported operating earnings.\nIf GEICO\nhad earned less money in 1982 but had paid an additional $1\nmillion in dividends, our reported earnings would have been\nlarger despite the poorer business results.\nConversely, if GEICO\nhad earned an additional $100 million - and retained it all - our\nreported earnings would have been unchanged.\nClearly\naccounting earnings can seriously misrepresent economic\nreality.\nWe prefer a concept of economic earnings that includes all\nundistributed earnings, regardless of ownership percentage.\nIn\nour view, the value to all owners of the retained earnings of a\nbusiness enterprise is determined by the effectiveness with which\nthose earnings are used - and not by the size of ones ownership\npercentage.\nIf you have owned .01 of 1% of Berkshire during the\npast decade, you have benefited economically in full measure from\nyour share of our retained earnings, no matter what your\naccounting system.\nProportionately, you have done just as well\nas if you had owned the magic 20%.\nBut if you have owned 100% of\na great many capital-intensive businesses during the decade,\nretained earnings that were credited fully and with painstaking\nprecision to you under standard accounting methods have resulted\nin minor or zero economic value.\nThis is not a criticism of\naccounting procedures.\nWe would not like to have the job of\ndesigning a better system.\nIts simply to say that managers and\ninvestors alike must understand that accounting numbers are the\nbeginning, not the end, of business valuation.\nIn most corporations, less-than-20% ownership positions are\nunimportant (perhaps, in part, because they prevent maximization\nof cherished reported earnings) and the distinction between\naccounting and economic results we have just discussed matters\nlittle.\nBut in our own case, such positions are of very large\nand growing importance.\nTheir magnitude, we believe, is what\nmakes our reported operating earnings figure of limited\nsignificance.\nIn our 1981 annual report we predicted that our share of\nundistributed earnings from four of our major non-controlled\nholdings would aggregate over $35 million in 1982.\nWith no\nchange in our holdings of three of these companies - GEICO,\nGeneral Foods and The Washington Post - and a considerable\nincrease in our ownership of the fourth, R. J. Reynolds\nIndustries, our share of undistributed 1982 operating earnings of\nthis group came to well over $40 million.\nThis number - not\nreflected at all in our earnings - is greater than our total\nreported earnings, which include only the $14 million in\ndividends received from these companies.\nAnd, of course, we have\na number of smaller ownership interests that, in aggregate, had\nsubstantial additional undistributed earnings.\nWe attach real significance to the general magnitude of\nthese numbers, but we dont believe they should be carried to ten\ndecimal places.\nRealization by Berkshire of such retained\nearnings through improved market valuations is subject to very\nsubstantial, but indeterminate, taxation.\nAnd while retained\nearnings over the years, and in the aggregate, have translated\ninto at least equal market value for shareholders, the\ntranslation has been both extraordinarily uneven among companies\nand irregular and unpredictable in timing.\nHowever, this very unevenness and irregularity offers\nadvantages to the value-oriented purchaser of fractional portions\nof businesses.\nThis investor may select from almost the entire\narray of major American corporations, including many far superior\nto virtually any of the businesses that could be bought in their\nentirety in a negotiated deal.\nAnd fractional-interest purchases\ncan be made in an auction market where prices are set by\nparticipants with behavior patterns that sometimes resemble those\nof an army of manic-depressive lemmings.\nWithin this gigantic auction arena, it is our job to select\nbusinesses with economic characteristics allowing each dollar of\nretained earnings to be translated eventually into at least a\ndollar of market value.\nDespite a lot of mistakes, we have so\nfar achieved this goal.\nIn doing so, we have been greatly\nassisted by Arthur Okuns patron saint for economists - St.\nOffset.\nIn some cases, that is, retained earnings attributable\nto our ownership position have had insignificant or even negative\nimpact on market value, while in other major positions a dollar\nretained by an investee corporation has been translated into two\nor more dollars of market value.\nTo date, our corporate over-\nachievers have more than offset the laggards.\nIf we can continue\nthis record, it will validate our efforts to maximize economic\nearnings, regardless of the impact upon accounting earnings.\nSatisfactory as our partial-ownership approach has been,\nwhat really makes us dance is the purchase of 100% of good\nbusinesses at reasonable prices.\nWeve accomplished this feat a\nfew times (and expect to do so again), but it is an\nextraordinarily difficult job - far more difficult than the\npurchase at attractive prices of fractional interests.\nAs we look at the major acquisitions that others made during\n1982, our reaction is not envy, but relief that we were non-\nparticipants.\nFor in many of these acquisitions, managerial\nintellect wilted in competition with managerial adrenaline The\nthrill of the chase blinded the pursuers to the consequences of\nthe catch.\nPascals observation seems apt: It has struck me\nthat all mens misfortunes spring from the single cause that they\nare unable to stay quietly in one room.\n(Your Chairman left the room once too often last year and\nalmost starred in the Acquisition Follies of 1982.\nIn\nretrospect, our major accomplishment of the year was that a very\nlarge purchase to which we had firmly committed was unable to be\ncompleted for reasons totally beyond our control.\nHad it come\noff, this transaction would have consumed extraordinary amounts\nof time and energy, all for a most uncertain payoff.\nIf we were\nto introduce graphics to this report, illustrating favorable\nbusiness developments of the past year, two blank pages depicting\nthis blown deal would be the appropriate centerfold.)\nOur partial-ownership approach can be continued soundly only\nas long as portions of attractive businesses can be acquired at\nattractive prices.\nWe need a moderately-priced stock market to\nassist us in this endeavor.\nThe market, like the Lord, helps\nthose who help themselves.\nBut, unlike the Lord, the market does\nnot forgive those who know not what they do.\nFor the investor, a\ntoo-high purchase price for the stock of an excellent company can\nundo the effects of a subsequent decade of favorable business\ndevelopments.\nShould the stock market advance to considerably higher\nlevels, our ability to utilize capital effectively in partial-\nownership positions will be reduced or eliminated.\nThis will\nhappen periodically: just ten years ago, at the height of the\ntwo-tier market mania (with high-return-on-equity businesses bid\nto the sky by institutional investors), Berkshires insurance\nsubsidiaries owned only $18 million in market value of equities,\nexcluding their interest in Blue Chip Stamps.\nAt that time, such\nequity holdings amounted to about 15% of our insurance company\ninvestments versus the present 80%.\nThere were as many good\nbusinesses around in 1972 as in 1982, but the prices the stock\nmarket placed upon those businesses in 1972 looked absurd.\nWhile\nhigh stock prices in the future would make our performance look\ngood temporarily, they would hurt our long-term business\nprospects rather than help them.\nWe currently are seeing early\ntraces of this problem.\nLong-Term Corporate Performance\nOur gain in net worth during 1982, valuing equities held by\nour insurance subsidiaries at market value (less capital gain\ntaxes payable if unrealized gains were actually realized)\namounted to $208 million.\nOn a beginning net worth base of $519\nmillion, the percentage gain was 40%.\nDuring the 18-year tenure of present management, book value\nhas grown from $19.46 per share to $737.43 per share, or 22.0%\ncompounded annually.\nYou can be certain that this percentage\nwill diminish in the future.\nGeometric progressions eventually\nforge their own anchors.\nBerkshires economic goal remains to produce a long-term\nrate of return well above the return achieved by the average\nlarge American corporation.\nOur willingness to purchase either\npartial or total ownership positions in favorably-situated\nbusinesses, coupled with reasonable discipline about the prices\nwe are willing to pay, should give us a good chance of achieving\nour goal.\nAgain this year the gain in market valuation of partially-\nowned businesses outpaced the gain in underlying economic value\nof those businesses.\nFor example, $79 million of our $208\nmillion gain is attributable to an increased market price for\nGEICO.\nThis company continues to do exceptionally well, and we\nare more impressed than ever by the strength of GEICOs basic\nbusiness idea and by the management skills of Jack Byrne.\n(Although not found in the catechism of the better business\nschools, Let Jack Do It works fine as a corporate creed for\nus.)\nHowever, GEICOs increase in market value during the past\ntwo years has been considerably greater than the gain in its\nintrinsic business value, impressive as the latter has been.\nWe\nexpected such a favorable variation at some point, as the\nperception of investors converged with business reality.\nAnd we\nlook forward to substantial future gains in underlying business\nvalue accompanied by irregular, but eventually full, market\nrecognition of such gains.\nYear-to-year variances, however, cannot consistently be in\nour favor.\nEven if our partially-owned businesses continue to\nperform well in an economic sense, there will be years when they\nperform poorly in the market.\nAt such times our net worth could\nshrink significantly.\nWe will not be distressed by such a\nshrinkage; if the businesses continue to look attractive and we\nhave cash available, we simply will add to our holdings at even\nmore favorable prices.\nSources of Reported Earnings\nThe table below shows the sources of Berkshires reported\nearnings.\nIn 1981 and 1982 Berkshire owned about 60% of Blue\nChip Stamps which, in turn, owned 80% of Wesco Financial\nCorporation.\nThe table displays aggregate operating earnings of\nthe various business entities, as well as Berkshires share of\nthose earnings.\nAll of the significant gains and losses\nattributable to unusual sales of assets by any of the business\nentities are aggregated with securities transactions in the line\nnear the bottom of the table, and are not included in operating\nearnings.\nNet Earnings\nEarnings Before Income Taxes\nAfter

describe 1982 operations.\nA copy of the\nfull annual report of either company will be mailed to any\nBerkshire shareholder upon request to Mr. Robert H. Bird for\nBlue Chip Stamps, 5801 South Eastern Avenue, Los Angeles,\nCalifornia 90040, or to Mrs. Jeanne Leach for Wesco Financial\nCorporation, 315 East Colorado Boulevard, Pasadena, California\n91109.\nI believe you will find the Blue Chip chronicle of\ndevelopments in the Buffalo newspaper situation particularly\ninteresting.\nThere are now only 14 cities in the United States\nwith a daily newspaper whose weekday circulation exceeds that of\nthe Buffalo News.\nBut the real story has been the growth in\nSunday circulation.\nSix years ago, prior to introduction of a\nSunday edition of the News, the long-established Courier-Express,\nas the only Sunday newspaper published in Buffalo, had\ncirculation of 272,000.\nThe News now has Sunday circulation of\n367,000, a 35% gain - even though the number of households within\nthe primary circulation area has shown little change during the\nsix years.\nWe know of no city in the United States with a long\nhistory of seven-day newspaper publication in which the\npercentage of households purchasing the Sunday newspaper has\ngrown at anything like this rate.\nTo the contrary, in most\ncities household penetration figures have grown negligibly, or\nnot at all.\nOur key managers in Buffalo - Henry Urban, Stan\nLipsey, Murray Light, Clyde Pinson, Dave Perona and Dick Feather\n- deserve great credit for this unmatched expansion in Sunday\nreadership.\nAs we indicated earlier, undistributed earnings in companies\nwe do not control are now fully as important as the reported\noperating earnings detailed in the preceding table.\nThe\ndistributed portion of non-controlled earnings, of course, finds\nits way into that table primarily through the net investment\nincome segment of Insurance Group earnings.\nWe show below Berkshires proportional holdings in those\nnon-controlled businesses for which only distributed earnings\n(dividends) are included in our earnings.\nNo. of Shares\nor Share Equiv.\nCost\nMarket\n---------------\n----------\n----------\n(000s omitted)\n460,650 (a)\nAffiliated Publications, Inc. ......\n$\n3,516\n$ 16,929\n908,800 (c)\nCrum & Forster .....................\n47,144\n48,962\n2,101,244 (b)\nGeneral Foods, Inc. ................\n66,277\n83,680\n7,200,000 (a)\nGEICO Corporation ..................\n47,138\n309,600\n2,379,200 (a)\nHandy & Harman .....................\n27,318\n46,692\n711,180 (a)\nInterpublic Group of Companies, Inc.\n4,531\n34,314\n282,500 (a)\nMedia General ......................\n4,545\n12,289\n391,400 (a)\nOgilvy & Mather Intl.

(Its difficult for an empty sack to\nstand upright.)\nThe great majority of managements, however, try to play it\nstraight.\nBut even managements of integrity may subconsciously\nbe less willing in poor profit years to fully recognize adverse\nloss trends.\nIndustry statistics indicate some deterioration in\nloss reserving practices during 1982 and the true combined ratio\nis likely to be modestly worse than indicated by our table.\nThe conventional wisdom is that 1983 or 1984 will see the\nworst of underwriting experience and then, as in the past, the\ncycle will move, significantly and steadily, toward better\nresults.\nWe disagree because of a pronounced change in the\ncompetitive environment, hard to see for many years but now quite\nvisible.\nTo understand the change, we need to look at some major\nfactors that affect levels of corporate profitability generally.\nBusinesses in industries with both substantial over-capacity and\na commodity product (undifferentiated in any customer-important\nway by factors such as performance, appearance, service support,\netc.) are prime candidates for profit troubles.\nThese may be\nescaped, true, if prices or costs are administered in some manner\nand thereby insulated at least partially from normal market\nforces.\nThis administration can be carried out (a) legally\nthrough government intervention (until recently, this category\nincluded pricing for truckers and deposit costs for financial\ninstitutions), (b) illegally through collusion, or (c) extra-\nlegally through OPEC-style foreign cartelization (with tag-along\nbenefits for domestic non-cartel operators).\nIf, however, costs and prices are determined by full-bore\ncompetition, there is more than ample capacity, and the buyer\ncares little about whose product or distribution services he\nuses, industry economics are almost certain to be unexciting.\nThey may well be disastrous.\nHence the constant struggle of every vendor to establish and\nemphasize special qualities of product or service.\nThis works\nwith candy bars (customers buy by brand name, not by asking for a\ntwo-ounce candy bar) but doesnt work with sugar (how often do\nyou hear, Ill have a cup of coffee with cream and C & H sugar,\nplease).\nIn many industries, differentiation simply cant be made\nmeaningful.\nA few producers in such industries may consistently\ndo well if they have a cost advantage that is both wide and\nsustainable.\nBy definition such exceptions are few, and, in many\nindustries, are non-existent.\nFor the great majority of\ncompanies selling commodityproducts, a depressing equation of\nbusiness economics prevails: persistent over-capacity without\nadministered prices (or costs) equals poor profitability.\nOf course, over-capacity may eventually self-correct, either\nas capacity shrinks or demand expands.\nUnfortunately for the\nparticipants, such corrections often are long delayed.\nWhen they\nfinally occur, the rebound to prosperity frequently produces a\npervasive enthusiasm for expansion that, within a few years,\nagain creates over-capacity and a new profitless environment.\nIn\nother words, nothing fails like success.\nWhat finally determines levels of long-term profitability in\nsuch industries is the ratio of supply-tight to supply-ample\nyears.\nFrequently that ratio is dismal. (It seems as if the most\nrecent supply-tight period in our textile business - it occurred\nsome years back - lasted the better part of a morning.)\nIn some industries, however, capacity-tight conditions can\nlast a long time.\nSometimes actual growth in demand will outrun\nforecasted growth for an extended period.\nIn other cases, adding\ncapacity requires very long lead times because complicated\nmanufacturing facilities must be planned and built.\nBut in the insurance business, to return to that subject,\ncapacity can be instantly created by capital plus an\nunderwriters willingness to sign his name. (Even capital is less\nimportant in a world in which state-sponsored guaranty funds\nprotect many policyholders against insurer insolvency.) Under\nalmost all conditions except that of fear for survival -\nproduced, perhaps, by a stock market debacle or a truly major\nnatural disaster - the insurance industry operates under the\ncompetitive sword of substantial overcapacity.\nGenerally, also,\ndespite heroic attempts to do otherwise, the industry sells a\nrelatively undifferentiated commodity-type product. (Many\ninsureds, including the managers of large businesses, do not even\nknow the names of their insurers.) Insurance, therefore, would\nseem to be a textbook case of an industry usually faced with the\ndeadly combination of excess capacity and a commodity product.\nWhy, then, was underwriting, despite the existence of\ncycles, generally profitable over many decades? (From 1950\nthrough 1970, the industry combined ratio averaged 99.0.\nallowing all investment income plus 1% of premiums to flow\nthrough to profits.) The answer lies primarily in the historic\nmethods of regulation and distribution.\nFor much of this\ncentury, a large portion of the industry worked, in effect,\nwithin a legal quasi-administered pricing system fostered by\ninsurance regulators.\nWhile price competition existed, it was\nnot pervasive among the larger companies.\nThe main competition\nwas for agents, who were courted via various non-price-related\nstrategies.\nFor the giants of the industry, most rates were set through\nnegotiations between industry bureaus (or through companies\nacting in accord with their recommendations) and state\nregulators.\nDignified haggling occurred, but it was between\ncompany and regulator rather than between company and customer.\nWhen the dust settled, Giant A charged the same price as Giant B\n- and both companies and agents were prohibited by law from\ncutting such filed rates.\nThe company-state negotiated prices included specific profit\nallowances and, when loss data indicated that current prices were\nunprofitable, both company managements and state regulators\nexpected that they would act together to correct the situation.\nThus, most of the pricing actions of the giants of the industry\nwere gentlemanly, predictable, and profit-producing.\nOf prime\nimportance - and in contrast to the way most of the business\nworld operated - insurance companies could legally price their\nway to profitability even in the face of substantial over-\ncapacity.\nThat day is gone.\nAlthough parts of the old structure\nremain, far more than enough new capacity exists outside of that\nstructure to force all parties, old and new, to respond.\nThe new\ncapacity uses various methods of distribution and is not\nreluctant to use price as a prime competitive weapon.\nIndeed, it\nrelishes that use.\nIn the process, customers have learned that\ninsurance is no longer a one-price business.\nThey wont forget.\nFuture profitability of the industry will be determined by\ncurrent competitive characteristics, not past ones.\nMany\nmanagers have been slow to recognize this.\nIts not only\ngenerals that prefer to fight the last war.\nMost business and\ninvestment analysis also comes from the rear-view mirror.\nIt\nseems clear to us, however, that only one condition will allow\nthe insurance industry to achieve significantly improved\nunderwriting results.\nThat is the same condition that will allow\nbetter results for the aluminum, copper, or corn producer - a\nmajor narrowing of the gap between demand and supply.\nUnfortunately, there can be no surge in demand for insurance\npolicies comparable to one that might produce a market tightness\nin copper or aluminum.\nRather, the supply of available insurance\ncoverage must be curtailed.\nSupply, in this context, is mental\nrather than physical: plants or companies need not be shut; only\nthe willingness of underwriters to sign their names need be\ncurtailed.\nThis contraction will not happen because of generally poor\nprofit levels.\nBad profits produce much hand-wringing and\nfinger-pointing.\nBut they do not lead major sources of insurance\ncapacity to turn their backs on very large chunks of business,\nthereby sacrificing market share and industry significance.\nInstead, major capacity withdrawals require a shock factor\nsuch as a natural or financial megadisaster.\nOne might occur\ntomorrow - or many years from now.\nThe insurance business - even\ntaking investment income into account - will not be particularly\nprofitable in the meantime.\nWhen supply ultimately contracts, large amounts of business\nwill be available for the few with large capital capacity, a\nwillingness to commit it, and an in-place distribution system.\nWe would expect great opportunities for our insurance\nsubsidiaries at such a time.\nDuring 1982, our insurance underwriting deteriorated far\nmore than did the industrys.\nFrom a profit position well above\naverage, we, slipped to a performance modestly below average.\nThe biggest swing was in National Indemnitys traditional\ncoverages.\nLines that have been highly profitable for us in the\npast are now priced at levels that guarantee underwriting losses.\nIn 1983 we expect our insurance group to record an average\nperformance in an industry in which average is very poor.\nTwo of our stars, Milt Thornton at Cypress and Floyd Taylor\nat Kansas Fire and Casualty, continued their outstanding records\nof producing an underwriting profit every year since joining us.\nBoth Milt and Floyd simply are incapable of being average.\nThey\nmaintain a passionately proprietary attitude toward their\noperations and have developed a business culture centered upon\nunusual cost-consciousness and customer service.\nIt shows on\ntheir scorecards.\nDuring 1982, parent company responsibility for most of our\ninsurance operations was given to Mike Goldberg.\nPlanning,\nrecruitment, and monitoring all have shown significant\nimprovement since Mike replaced me in this role.\nGEICO continues to be managed with a zeal for efficiency and\nvalue to the customer that virtually guarantees unusual success.\nJack Byrne and Bill Snyder are achieving the most elusive of\nhuman goals - keeping things simple and remembering what you set\nout to do.\nIn Lou Simpson, additionally, GEICO has the best\ninvestment manager in the property-casualty business.\nWe are\nhappy with every aspect of this operation.\nGEICO is a\nmagnificent illustration of the high-profit exception we\ndescribed earlier in discussing commodity industries with over-\ncapacity - a company with a wide and sustainable cost advantage.\nOur 35% interest in GEICO represents about $250 million of\npremium volume, an amount considerably greater than all of the\ndirect volume we produce.\nIssuance of Equity\nBerkshire and Blue Chip are considering merger in 1983.\nIf\nit takes place, it will involve an exchange of stock based upon\nan identical valuation method applied to both companies.\nThe one\nother significant issuance of shares by Berkshire or its\naffiliated companies that occurred during present managements\ntenure was in the 1978 merger of Berkshire with Diversified\nRetailing Company.\nOur share issuances follow a simple basic rule: we will not\nissue shares unless we receive as much intrinsic business value\nas we give.\nSuch a policy might seem axiomatic.\nWhy, you might\nask, would anyone issue dollar bills in exchange for fifty-cent\npieces?\nUnfortunately, many corporate managers have been willing\nto do just that.\nThe first choice of these managers in making acquisitions\nmay be to use cash or debt.\nBut frequently the CEOs cravings\noutpace cash and credit resources (certainly mine always have).\nFrequently, also, these cravings occur when his own stock is\nselling far below intrinsic business value.\nThis state of\naffairs produces a moment of truth.\nAt that point, as Yogi Berra\nhas said, You can observe a lot just by watching. For\nshareholders then will find which objective the management truly\nprefers - expansion of domain or maintenance of owners wealth.\nThe need to choose between these objectives occurs for some\nsimple reasons.\nCompanies often sell in the stock market below\ntheir intrinsic business value.\nBut when a company wishes to\nsell out completely, in a negotiated transaction, it inevitably\nwants to - and usually can - receive full business value in\nwhatever kind of currency the value is to be delivered.\nIf cash\nis to be used in payment, the sellers calculation of value\nreceived couldnt be easier.\nIf stock of the buyer is to be the\ncurrency, the sellers calculation is still relatively easy: just\nfigure the market value in cash of what is to be received in\nstock.\nMeanwhile, the buyer wishing to use his own stock as\ncurrency for the purchase has no problems if the stock is selling\nin the market at full intrinsic value.\nBut suppose it is selling at only half intrinsic value.\nIn\nthat case, the buyer is faced with the unhappy prospect of using\na substantially undervalued currency to make its purchase.\nIronically, were the buyer to instead be a seller of its\nentire business, it too could negotiate for, and probably get,\nfull intrinsic business value.\nBut when the buyer makes a\npartial sale of itself - and that is what the issuance of shares\nto make an acquisition amounts to - it can customarily get no\nhigher value set on its shares than the market chooses to grant\nit.\nThe acquirer who nevertheless barges ahead ends up using an\nundervalued (market value) currency to pay for a fully valued\n(negotiated value) property.\nIn effect, the acquirer must give\nup $2 of value to receive $1 of value.\nUnder such circumstances,\na marvelous business purchased at a fair sales price becomes a\nterrible buy.\nFor gold valued as gold cannot be purchased\nintelligently through the utilization of gold - or even silver -\nvalued as lead.\nIf, however, the thirst for size and action is strong\nenough, the acquirers manager will find ample rationalizations\nfor such a value-destroying issuance of stock.\nFriendly\ninvestment bankers will reassure him as to the soundness of his\nactions. (Dont ask the barber whether you need a haircut.)\nA few favorite rationalizations employed by stock-issuing\nmanagements follow:\n(a) The company were buying is going to be worth a lot\nmore in the future. (Presumably so is the interest in\nthe old business that is being traded away; future\nprospects are implicit in the business valuation\nprocess.\nIf 2X is issued for X, the imbalance still\nexists when both parts double in business value.)\n(b) We have to grow. (Who, it might be asked, is the we?\nFor present shareholders, the reality is that all\nexisting businesses shrink when shares are issued.\nWere\nBerkshire to issue shares tomorrow for an acquisition,\nBerkshire would own everything that it now owns plus the\nnew business, but your interest in such hard-to-match\nbusinesses as Sees Candy Shops, National Indemnity,\netc. would automatically be reduced.\nIf (1) your family\nowns a 120-acre farm and (2)\nyou invite a neighbor with\n60 acres of comparable land to merge his farm into an\nequal partnership - with you to be managing partner,\nthen (3) your managerial domain will have grown to 180\nacres but you will have permanently shrunk by 25% your\nfamilys ownership interest in both acreage and crops.\nManagers who want to expand their domain at the expense\nof owners might better consider a career in government.)\n(c) Our stock is undervalued and weve minimized its use in\nthis deal - but we need to give the selling shareholders\n51% in stock and 49% in cash so that certain of those\nshareholders can get the tax-free exchange they want.\n(This argument acknowledges that it is beneficial to the\nacquirer to hold down the issuance of shares, and we like\nthat.\nBut if it hurts the old owners to utilize shares\non a 100% basis, it very likely hurts on a 51% basis.\nAfter all, a man is not charmed if a spaniel defaces his\nlawn, just because its a spaniel and not a St. Bernard.\nAnd the wishes of sellers cant be the determinant of the\nbest interests of the buyer - what would happen if,\nheaven forbid, the seller insisted that as a condition of\nmerger the CEO of the acquirer be replaced?)\nThere are three ways to avoid destruction of value for old\nowners when shares are issued for acquisitions.\nOne is to have a\ntrue business-value-for-business-value merger, such as the\nBerkshire-Blue Chip combination is intended to be.\nSuch a merger\nattempts to be fair to shareholders of both parties, with each\nreceiving just as much as it gives in terms of intrinsic business\nvalue.\nThe Dart Industries-Kraft and Nabisco Standard Brands\nmergers appeared to be of this type, but they are the exceptions.\nIts not that acquirers wish to avoid such deals; its just that\nthey are very hard to do.\nThe second route presents itself when the acquirers stock\nsells at or above its intrinsic business value.\nIn that\nsituation, the use of stock as currency actually may enhance the\nwealth of the acquiring companys owners.\nMany mergers were\naccomplished on this basis in the 1965-69 period.\nThe results\nwere the converse of most of the activity since 1970: the\nshareholders of the acquired company received very inflated\ncurrency (frequently pumped up by dubious accounting and\npromotional techniques) and were the losers of wealth through\nsuch transactions.\nDuring recent years the second solution has been available\nto very few large companies.\nThe exceptions have primarily been\nthose companies in glamorous or promotional businesses to which\nthe market temporarily attaches valuations at or above intrinsic\nbusiness valuation.\nThe third solution is for the acquirer to go ahead with the\nacquisition, but then subsequently repurchase a quantity of\nshares equal to the number issued in the merger.\nIn this manner,\nwhat originally was a stock-for-stock merger can be converted,\neffectively, into a cash-for-stock acquisition.\nRepurchases of\nthis kind are damage-repair moves.\nRegular readers will\ncorrectly guess that we much prefer repurchases that directly\nenhance the wealth of owners instead of repurchases that merely\nrepair previous damage.\nScoring touchdowns is more exhilarating\nthan recovering ones fumbles.\nBut, when a fumble has occurred,\nrecovery is important and we heartily recommend damage-repair\nrepurchases that turn a bad stock deal into a fair cash deal.\nThe language utilized in mergers tends to confuse the issues\nand encourage irrational actions by managers.\nFor example,\ndilution is usually carefully calculated on a pro forma basis\nfor both book value and current earnings per share.\nParticular\nemphasis is given to the latter item.\nWhen that calculation is\nnegative (dilutive) from the acquiring companys standpoint, a\njustifying explanation will be made (internally, if not\nelsewhere) that the lines will cross favorably at some point in\nthe future. (While deals often fail in practice, they never fail\nin projections - if the CEO is visibly panting over a prospective\nacquisition, subordinates and consultants will supply the\nrequisite projections to rationalize any price.) Should the\ncalculation produce numbers that are immediately positive - that\nis, anti-dilutive - for the acquirer, no comment is thought to be\nnecessary.\nThe attention given this form of dilution is overdone:\ncurrent earnings per share (or even earnings per share of the\nnext few years) are an important variable in most business\nvaluations, but far from all powerful.\nThere have been plenty of mergers, non-dilutive in this\nlimited sense, that were instantly value destroying for the\nacquirer.\nAnd some mergers that have diluted current and near-\nterm earnings per share have in fact been value-enhancing.\nWhat\nreally counts is whether a merger is dilutive or anti-dilutive in\nterms of intrinsic business value (a judgment involving\nconsideration of many variables).\nWe believe calculation of\ndilution from this viewpoint to be all-important (and too seldom\nmade).\nA second language problem relates to the equation of\nexchange.\nIf Company A announces that it will issue shares to\nmerge with Company B, the process is customarily described as\nCompany A to Acquire Company B, or B Sells to A.\nClearer\nthinking about the matter would result if a more awkward but more\naccurate description were used: Part of A sold to acquire B, or\nOwners of B to receive part of A in exchange for their\nproperties.\nIn a trade, what you are giving is just as\nimportant as what you are getting.\nThis remains true even when\nthe final tally on what is being given is delayed.\nSubsequent\nsales of common stock or convertible issues, either to complete\nthe financing for a deal or to restore balance sheet strength,\nmust be fully counted in evaluating the fundamental mathematics\nof the original acquisition. (If corporate pregnancy is going to\nbe the consequence of corporate mating, the time to face that\nfact is before the moment of ecstasy.)\nManagers and directors might sharpen their thinking by\nasking themselves if they would sell 100% of their business on\nthe same basis they are being asked to sell part of it.\nAnd if\nit isnt smart to sell all on such a basis, they should ask\nthemselves why it is smart to sell a portion.\nA cumulation of\nsmall managerial stupidities will produce a major stupidity - not\na major triumph. (Las Vegas has been built upon the wealth\ntransfers that occur when people engage in seemingly-small\ndisadvantageous capital transactions.)\nThe giving versus getting factor can most easily be\ncalculated in the case of registered investment companies.\nAssume Investment Company X, selling at 50% of asset value,\nwishes to merge with Investment Company Y.\nAssume, also, that\nCompany X therefore decides to issue shares equal in market value\nto 100% of Ys asset value.\nSuch a share exchange would leave X trading $2 of its\nprevious intrinsic value for $1 of Ys intrinsic value.\nProtests\nwould promptly come forth from both Xs shareholders and the SEC,\nwhich rules on the fairness of registered investment company\nmergers.\nSuch a transaction simply would not be allowed.\nIn the case of manufacturing, service, financial companies,\netc., values are not normally as precisely calculable as in the\ncase of investment companies.\nBut we have seen mergers in these\nindustries that just as dramatically destroyed value for the\nowners of the acquiring company as was the case in the\nhypothetical illustration above.\nThis destruction could not\nhappen if management and directors would assess the fairness of\nany transaction by using the same yardstick in the measurement of\nboth businesses.\nFinally, a word should be said about the double whammy\neffect upon owners of the acquiring company when value-diluting\nstock issuances occur.\nUnder such circumstances, the first blow\nis the loss of intrinsic business value that occurs through the\nmerger itself.\nThe second is the downward revision in market\nvaluation that, quite rationally, is given to that now-diluted\nbusiness value.\nFor current and prospective owners\nunderstandably will not pay as much for assets lodged in the\nhands of a management that has a record of wealth-destruction\nthrough unintelligent share issuances as they will pay for assets\nentrusted to a management with precisely equal operating talents,\nbut a known distaste for anti-owner actions.\nOnce management\nshows itself insensitive to the interests of owners, shareholders\nwill suffer a long time from the price/value ratio afforded their\nstock (relative to other stocks), no matter what assurances\nmanagement gives that the value-diluting action taken was a one-\nof-a-kind event.\nThose assurances are treated by the market much as one-bug-\nin-the-salad explanations are treated at restaurants.\nSuch\nexplanations, even when accompanied by a new waiter, do not\neliminate a drop in the demand (and hence market value) for\nsalads, both on the part of the offended customer and his\nneighbors pondering what to order.\nOther things being equal, the\nhighest stock market prices relative to intrinsic business value\nare given to companies whose managers have demonstrated their\nunwillingness to issue shares at any time on terms unfavorable to\nthe owners of the business.\nAt Berkshire, or any company whose policies we determine\n(including Blue Chip and Wesco), we will issue shares only if our\nowners receive in business value as much as we give.\nWe will not\nequate activity with progress or corporate size with owner-\nwealth.\nMiscellaneous\nThis annual report is read by a varied audience, and it is\npossible that some members of that audience may be helpful to us\nin our acquisition program.\nWe prefer:\n(1) large purchases (at least $5 million of after-tax\nearnings),\n(2) demonstrated consistent earning power (future\nprojections are of little interest to us, nor are\nturn-around situations),\n(3) businesses earning good returns on equity while\nemploying little or no debt,\n(4) management in place (we cant supply it),\n(5) simple businesses (if theres lots of technology, we\nwont understand it),\n(6) an offering price (we dont want to waste our time or\nthat of the seller by talking, even preliminarily,\nabout a transaction when price is unknown).\nWe will not engage in unfriendly transactions.\nWe can\npromise complete confidentiality and a very fast answer as to\npossible interest - customarily within five minutes.\nCash\npurchases are preferred, but we will consider the use of stock\nwhen it can be done on the basis described in the previous\nsection.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nOur shareholder-designated contributions program met with\nenthusiasm again this year; 95.8% of eligible shares\nparticipated.\nThis response was particularly encouraging since\nonly $1 per share was made available for designation, down from\n$2 in 1981.\nIf the merger with Blue Chip takes place, a probable\nby-product will be the attainment of a consolidated tax position\nthat will significantly enlarge our contribution base and give us\na potential for designating bigger per-share amounts in the\nfuture.\nIf you wish to participate in future programs, we strongly\nurge that you immediately make sure that your shares are\nregistered in the actual owners name, not a street or nominee\nname.\nFor new shareholders, a more complete description of the\nprogram is on pages 62-63.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nIn a characteristically rash move, we have expanded World\nHeadquarters by 252 square feet (17%), coincidental with the\nsigning of a new five-year lease at 1440 Kiewit Plaza.\nThe five\npeople who work here with me - Joan Atherton, Mike Goldberg,\nGladys Kaiser, Verne McKenzie and Bill Scott - outproduce\ncorporate groups many times their number.\nA compact organization\nlets all of us spend our time managing the business rather than\nmanaging each other.\nCharlie Munger, my partner in management, will continue to\noperate from Los Angeles whether or not the Blue Chip merger\noccurs.\nCharlie and I are interchangeable in business decisions.\nDistance impedes us not at all: weve always found a telephone\ncall to be more productive than a half-day committee meeting.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nTwo of our managerial stars retired this year: Phil Liesche\nat 65 from National Indemnity Company, and Ben Rosner at 79 from\nAssociated Retail Stores.\nBoth of these men made you, as\nshareholders of Berkshire, a good bit wealthier than you\notherwise would have been.\nNational Indemnity has been the most\nimportant operation in Berkshires growth.\nPhil and Jack\nRingwalt, his predecessor, were the two prime movers in National\nIndemnitys success.\nBen Rosner sold Associated Retail Stores to\nDiversified Retailing Company for cash in 1967, promised to stay\non only until the end of the year, and then hit business home\nruns for us for the next fifteen years.\nBoth Ben and Phil ran their businesses for Berkshire with\nevery bit of the care and drive that they would have exhibited\nhad they personally owned 100% of these businesses.\nNo rules\nwere necessary to enforce or even encourage this attitude; it was\nembedded in the character of these men long before we came on the\nscene.\nTheir good character became our good fortune.\nIf we can\ncontinue to attract managers with the qualities of Ben and Phil,\nyou need not worry about Berkshires future.\nWarren E.

    "text": "Chairman's Letter - 1983\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nThis past year our registered shareholders increased from\nabout 1900 to about 2900.\nMost of this growth resulted from our\nmerger with Blue Chip Stamps, but there also was an acceleration\nin the pace of natural increase that has raised us from the\n1000 level a few years ago.\nWith so many new shareholders, its appropriate to summarize\nthe major business principles we follow that pertain to the\nmanager-owner relationship:\no Although our form is corporate, our attitude is\npartnership.\nCharlie Munger and I think of our shareholders as\nowner-partners, and of ourselves as managing partners.\n(Because\nof the size of our shareholdings we also are, for better or\nworse, controlling partners.) We do not view the company itself\nas the ultimate owner of our business assets but, instead, view\nthe company as a conduit through which our shareholders own the\nassets.\no In line with this owner-orientation, our directors are all\nmajor shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway.\nIn the case of at\nleast four of the five, over 50% of family net worth is\nrepresented by holdings of Berkshire.\nWe eat our own cooking.\no Our long-term economic goal (subject to some qualifications\nmentioned later) is to maximize the average annual rate of gain\nin intrinsic business value on a per-share basis.\nWe do not\nmeasure the economic significance or performance of Berkshire by\nits size; we measure by per-share progress.\nWe are certain that\nthe rate of per-share progress will diminish in the future - a\ngreatly enlarged capital base will see to that.\nBut we will be\ndisappointed if our rate does not exceed that of the average\nlarge American corporation.\no Our preference would be to reach this goal by directly\nowning a diversified group of businesses that generate cash and\nconsistently earn above-average returns on capital.\nOur second\nchoice is to own parts of similar businesses, attained primarily\nthrough purchases of marketable common stocks by our insurance\nsubsidiaries.\nThe price and availability of businesses and the\nneed for insurance capital determine any given years capital\nallocation.\no Because of this two-pronged approach to business ownership\nand because of the limitations of conventional accounting,\nconsolidated reported earnings may reveal relatively little about\nour true economic performance.\nCharlie and I, both as owners and\nmanagers, virtually ignore such consolidated numbers.\nHowever,\nwe will also report to you the earnings of each major business we\ncontrol, numbers we consider of great importance.\nThese figures,\nalong with other information we will supply about the individual\nbusinesses, should generally aid you in making judgments about\nthem.\no Accounting consequences do not influence our operating or\ncapital-allocation decisions.\nWhen acquisition costs are\nsimilar, we much prefer to purchase $2 of earnings that is not\nreportable by us under standard accounting principles than to\npurchase $1 of earnings that is reportable.\nThis is precisely\nthe choice that often faces us since entire businesses (whose\nearnings will be fully reportable) frequently sell for double the\npro-rata price of small portions (whose earnings will be largely\nunreportable).\nIn aggregate and over time, we expect the\nunreported earnings to be fully reflected in our intrinsic\nbusiness value through capital gains.\no We rarely use much debt and, when we do, we attempt to\nstructure it on a long-term fixed rate basis.\nWe will reject\ninteresting opportunities rather than over-leverage our balance\nsheet.\nThis conservatism has penalized our results but it is the\nonly behavior that leaves us comfortable, considering our\nfiduciary obligations to policyholders, depositors, lenders and\nthe many equity holders who have committed unusually large\nportions of their net worth to our care.\no A managerial wish list will not be filled at shareholder\nexpense.\nWe will not diversify by purchasing entire businesses\nat control prices that ignore long-term economic consequences to\nour shareholders.\nWe will only do with your money what we would\ndo with our own, weighing fully the values you can obtain by\ndiversifying your own portfolios through direct purchases in the\nstock market.\no We feel noble intentions should be checked periodically\nagainst results.\nWe test the wisdom of retaining earnings by\nassessing whether retention, over time, delivers shareholders at\nleast $1 of market value for each $1 retained.\nTo date, this\ntest has been met.\nWe will continue to apply it on a five-year\nrolling basis.\nAs our net worth grows, it is more difficult to\nuse retained earnings wisely.\no We will issue common stock only when we receive as much in\nbusiness value as we give.\nThis rule applies to all forms of\nissuance - not only mergers or public stock offerings, but stock\nfor-debt swaps, stock options, and convertible securities as\nwell.\nWe will not sell small portions of your company - and that\nis what the issuance of shares amounts to - on a basis\ninconsistent with the value of the entire enterprise.\no You should be fully aware of one attitude Charlie and I\nshare that hurts our financial performance: regardless of price,\nwe have no interest at all in selling any good businesses that\nBerkshire owns, and are very reluctant to sell sub-par businesses\nas long as we expect them to generate at least some cash and as\nlong as we feel good about their managers and labor relations.\nWe hope not to repeat the capital-allocation mistakes that led us\ninto such sub-par businesses.\nAnd we react with great caution to\nsuggestions that our poor businesses can be restored to\nsatisfactory profitability by major capital expenditures.\n(The\nprojections will be dazzling - the advocates will be sincere -\nbut, in the end, major additional investment in a terrible\nindustry usually is about as rewarding as struggling in\nquicksand.) Nevertheless, gin rummy managerial behavior (discard\nyour least promising business at each turn) is not our style.\nWe\nwould rather have our overall results penalized a bit than engage\nin it.\no We will be candid in our reporting to you, emphasizing the\npluses and minuses important in appraising business value.\nOur\nguideline is to tell you the business facts that we would want to\nknow if our positions were reversed.\nWe owe you no less.\nMoreover, as a company with a major communications business, it\nwould be inexcusable for us to apply lesser standards of\naccuracy, balance and incisiveness when reporting on ourselves\nthan we would expect our news people to apply when reporting on\nothers.\nWe also believe candor benefits us as managers: the CEO\nwho misleads others in public may eventually mislead himself in\nprivate.\no Despite our policy of candor, we will discuss our\nactivities in marketable securities only to the extent legally\nrequired.\nGood investment ideas are rare, valuable and subject\nto competitive appropriation just as good product or business\nacquisition ideas are.\nTherefore, we normally will not talk\nabout our investment ideas.\nThis ban extends even to securities\nwe have sold (because we may purchase them again) and to stocks\nwe are incorrectly rumored to be buying.\nIf we deny those\nreports but say no comment on other occasions, the no-comments\nbecome confirmation.\nThat completes the catechism, and we can now move on to the\nhigh point of 1983 - the acquisition of a majority interest in\nNebraska Furniture Mart and our association with Rose Blumkin and\nher family.\nNebraska Furniture Mart\nLast year, in discussing how managers with bright, but\nadrenalin-soaked minds scramble after foolish acquisitions, I\nquoted Pascal: It has struck me that all the misfortunes of men\nspring from the single cause that they are unable to stay quietly\nin one room.\nEven Pascal would have left the room for Mrs. Blumkin.\nAbout 67 years ago Mrs. Blumkin, then 23, talked her way\npast a border guard to leave Russia for America.\nShe had no\nformal education, not even at the grammar school level, and knew\nno English.\nAfter some years in this country, she learned the\nlanguage when her older daughter taught her, every evening, the\nwords she had learned in school during the day.\nIn 1937, after many years of selling used clothing, Mrs.\nBlumkin had saved $500 with which to realize her dream of opening\na furniture store.\nUpon seeing the American Furniture Mart in\nChicago - then the center of the nations wholesale furniture\nactivity - she decided to christen her dream Nebraska Furniture\nMart.\nShe met every obstacle you would expect (and a few you\nwouldnt) when a business endowed with only $500 and no\nlocational or product advantage goes up against rich, long-\nentrenched competition.\nAt one early point, when her tiny\nresources ran out, Mrs.\nB (a personal trademark now as well\nrecognized in Greater Omaha as Coca-Cola or Sanka) coped in a way\nnot taught at business schools: she simply sold the furniture and\nappliances from her home in order to pay creditors precisely as\npromised.\nOmaha retailers began to recognize that Mrs. B would offer\ncustomers far better deals than they had been giving, and they\npressured furniture and carpet manufacturers not to sell to her.\nBut by various strategies she obtained merchandise and cut prices\nsharply.\nMrs. B was then hauled into court for violation of Fair\nTrade laws.\nShe not only won all the cases, but received\ninvaluable publicity.\nAt the end of one case, after\ndemonstrating to the court that she could profitably sell carpet\nat a huge discount from the prevailing price, she sold the judge\n$1400 worth of carpet.\nToday Nebraska Furniture Mart generates over $100 million of\nsales annually out of one 200,000 square-foot store.\nNo other\nhome furnishings store in the country comes close to that volume.\nThat single store also sells more furniture, carpets, and\nappliances than do all Omaha competitors combined.\nOne question I always ask myself in appraising a business is\nhow I would like, assuming I had ample capital and skilled\npersonnel, to compete with it.\nId rather wrestle grizzlies than\ncompete with Mrs. B and her progeny.\nThey buy brilliantly, they\noperate at expense ratios competitors dont even dream about, and\nthey then pass on to their customers much of the savings.\nIts\nthe ideal business - one built upon exceptional value to the\ncustomer that in turn translates into exceptional economics for\nits owners.\nMrs. B is wise as well as smart and, for far-sighted family\nreasons, was willing to sell the business last year.\nI had\nadmired both the family and the business for decades, and a deal\nwas quickly made.\nBut Mrs. B, now 90, is not one to go home and\nrisk, as she puts it, losing her marbles.\nShe remains Chairman\nand is on the sales floor seven days a week.\nCarpet sales are\nher specialty.\nShe personally sells quantities that would be a\ngood departmental total for other carpet retailers.\nWe purchased 90% of the business - leaving 10% with members\nof the family who are involved in management - and have optioned\n10% to certain key young family managers.\nAnd what managers they are.\nGeneticists should do\nhandsprings over the Blumkin family.\nLouie Blumkin, Mrs.\nBs\nson, has been President of Nebraska Furniture Mart for many years\nand is widely regarded as the shrewdest buyer of furniture and\nappliances in the country.\nLouie says he had the best teacher,\nand Mrs. B says she had the best student.\nTheyre both right.\nLouie and his three sons all have the Blumkin business ability,\nwork ethic, and, most important, character.\nOn top of that, they\nare really nice people.\nWe are delighted to be in partnership\nwith them.\nCorporate Performance\nDuring 1983 our book value increased from $737.43 per share\nto $975.83 per share, or by 32%.\nWe never take the one-year\nfigure very seriously.\nAfter all, why should the time required\nfor a planet to circle the sun synchronize precisely with the\ntime required for business actions to pay off?\nInstead, we\nrecommend not less than a five-year test as a rough yardstick of\neconomic performance.\nRed lights should start flashing if the\nfive-year average annual gain falls much below the return on\nequity earned over the period by American industry in aggregate.\n(Watch out for our explanation if that occurs as Goethe observed,\nWhen ideas fail, words come in very handy.)\nDuring the 19-year tenure of present management, book value\nhas grown from $19.46 per share to $975.83, or 22.6% compounded\nannually.\nConsidering our present size, nothing close to this\nrate of return can be sustained.\nThose who believe otherwise\nshould pursue a career in sales, but avoid one in mathematics.\nWe report our progress in terms of book value because in our\ncase (though not, by any means, in all cases) it is a\nconservative but reasonably adequate proxy for growth in\nintrinsic business value - the measurement that really counts.\nBook values virtue as a score-keeping measure is that it is easy\nto calculate and doesnt involve the subjective (but important)\njudgments employed in calculation of intrinsic business value.\nIt is important to understand, however, that the two terms - book\nvalue and intrinsic business value - have very different\nmeanings.\nBook value is an accounting concept, recording the\naccumulated financial input from both contributed capital and\nretained earnings.\nIntrinsic business value is an economic\nconcept, estimating future cash output discounted to present\nvalue.\nBook value tells you what has been put in; intrinsic\nbusiness value estimates what can be taken out.\nAn analogy will suggest the difference.\nAssume you spend\nidentical amounts putting each of two children through college.\nThe book value (measured by financial input) of each childs\neducation would be the same.\nBut the present value of the future\npayoff (the intrinsic business value) might vary enormously -\nfrom zero to many times the cost of the education.\nSo, also, do\nbusinesses having equal financial input end up with wide\nvariations in value.\nAt Berkshire, at the beginning of fiscal 1965 when the\npresent management took over, the $19.46 per share book value\nconsiderably overstated intrinsic business value.\nAll of that\nbook value consisted of textile assets that could not earn, on\naverage, anything close to an appropriate rate of return.\nIn the\nterms of our analogy, the investment in textile assets resembled\ninvestment in a largely-wasted education.\nNow, however, our intrinsic business value considerably\nexceeds book value.\nThere are two major reasons:\n(1) Standard accounting principles require that common\nstocks held by our insurance subsidiaries be stated on\nour books at market value, but that other stocks we own\nbe carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market.\nAt the end of 1983, the market value of this latter\ngroup exceeded carrying value by $70 million pre-tax,\nor about $50 million after tax.\nThis excess belongs in\nour intrinsic business value, but is not included in\nthe calculation of book value;\n(2) More important, we own several businesses that possess\neconomic Goodwill (which is properly includable in\nintrinsic business value) far larger than the\naccounting Goodwill that is carried on our balance\nsheet and reflected in book value.\nGoodwill, both economic and accounting, is an arcane subject\nand requires more explanation than is appropriate here.\nThe\nappendix that follows this letter - Goodwill and its\nAmortization: The Rules and The Realities - explains why\neconomic and accounting Goodwill can, and usually do, differ\nenormously.\nYou can live a full and rewarding life without ever thinking\nabout Goodwill and its amortization.\nBut students of investment\nand management should understand the nuances of the subject.\nMy\nown thinking has changed drastically from 35 years ago when I was\ntaught to favor tangible assets and to shun businesses whose\nvalue depended largely upon economic Goodwill.\nThis bias caused\nme to make many important business mistakes of omission, although\nrelatively few of commission.\nKeynes identified my problem: The difficulty lies not in\nthe new ideas but in escaping from the old ones. My escape was\nlong delayed, in part because most of what I had been taught by\nthe same teacher had been (and continues to be) so\nextraordinarily valuable.\nUltimately, business experience,\ndirect and vicarious, produced my present strong preference for\nbusinesses that possess large amounts of enduring Goodwill and\nthat utilize a minimum of tangible assets.\nI recommend the Appendix to those who are comfortable with\naccounting terminology and who have an interest in understanding\nthe business aspects of Goodwill.\nWhether or not you wish to\ntackle the Appendix, you should be aware that Charlie and I\nbelieve that Berkshire possesses very significant economic\nGoodwill value above that reflected in our book value.\nSources of Reported Earnings\nThe table below shows the sources of Berkshires reported\nearnings.\nIn 1982, Berkshire owned about 60% of Blue Chip Stamps\nwhereas, in 1983, our ownership was 60% throughout the first six\nmonths and 100% thereafter.\nIn turn, Berkshires net interest in\nWesco was 48% during 1982 and the first six months of 1983, and\n80% for the balance of 1983.\nBecause of these changed ownership\npercentages, the first two columns of the table provide the best\nmeasure of underlying business performance.\nAll of the significant gains and losses attributable to\nunusual sales of assets by any of the business entities are\naggregated with securities transactions on the line near the\nbottom of the table, and are not included in operating earnings.\n(We regard any annual figure for realized capital gains or losses\nas meaningless, but we regard the aggregate realized and\nunrealized capital gains over a period of years as very\nimportant.) Furthermore, amortization of Goodwill is not charged\nagainst the specific businesses but, for reasons outlined in the\nAppendix, is set forth as a separate item.\nNet Earnings\nEarnings Before Income Taxes\nAfter Tax\n--------------------------------------\n------------------\nTotal\nBerkshire Share\nBerkshire Share\n------------------\n------------------\n------------------\n1983\n1982\n1983\n1982\n1983\n1982\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n(000s omitted)\nOperating Earnings:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting ............ $(33,872) $(21,558) $(33,872) $(21,558) $(18,400) $(11,345)\nNet Investment Income ...\n43,810\n41,620\n43,810\n41,620\n39,114\n35,270\nBerkshire-Waumbec Textiles\n(100)\n(1,545)\n(100)\n(1,545)\n(63)\n(862)\nAssociated Retail Stores ..\n697\n914\n697\n914\n355\n446\nNebraska Furniture Mart(1)\n3,812\n--\n3,049\n--\n1,521\n--\nSees Candies .............\n27,411\n23,884\n24,526\n14,235\n12,212\n6,914\nBuffalo Evening News ......\n19,352\n(1,215)\n16,547\n(724)\n8,832\n(226)\nBlue Chip Stamps(2) .......\n(1,422)\n4,182\n(1,876)\n2,492\n(353)\n2,472\nWesco Financial - Parent ..\n7,493\n6,156\n4,844\n2,937\n3,448\n2,210\nMutual Savings and Loan ...\n(798)\n(6)\n(467)\n(2)\n1,917\n1,524\nPrecision Steel ...........\n3,241\n1,035\n2,102\n493\n1,136\n265\nInterest on Debt ..........\n(15,104)\n(14,996)\n(13,844)\n(12,977)\n(7,346)\n(6,951)\nSpecial GEICO Distribution\n21,000\n--\n21,000\n--\n19,551\n--\nShareholder-Designated\nContributions ..........\n(3,066)\n(891)\n(3,066)\n(891)\n(1,656)\n(481)\nAmortization of Goodwill ..\n(532)\n151\n(563)\n90\n(563)\n90\nOther .....................\n10,121\n3,371\n9,623\n2,658\n8,490\n2,171\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nOperating Earnings ..........\n82,043\n41,102\n72,410\n27,742\n68,195\n31,497\nSales of securities and\nunusual sales of assets ..\n67,260\n36,651\n65,089\n21,875\n45,298\n14,877\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nTotal Earnings .............. $149,303\n$ 77,753\n$137,499\n$ 49,617\n$113,493\n$ 46,374\n========\n========\n========\n========\n========\n========\n(1) October through December\n(2) 1982 and 1983 are not comparable;

some will disappoint us,\nothers will deliver pleasant surprises.\nTo date our experience\nhas been better than we originally anticipated, In aggregate, we\nhave received far more than a dollar of market value gain for\nevery dollar of earnings retained.\nThe following table shows our 1983 yearend net holdings in\nmarketable equities.\nAll numbers represent 100% of Berkshires\nholdings, and 80% of Wescos holdings.\nThe portion attributable\nto minority shareholders of Wesco has been excluded.\nNo. of Shares\nCost\nMarket\n-------------\n----------\n----------\n(000s omitted)\n690,975\nAffiliated Publications, Inc. ....\n$\n3,516\n$\n26,603\n4,451,544\nGeneral Foods Corporation(a) .....\n163,786\n228,698\n6,850,000\nGEICO Corporation ................\n47,138\n398,156\n2,379,200\nHandy & Harman ...................\n27,318\n42,231\n636,310\nInterpublic Group of Companies, Inc.\n4,056\n33,088\n197,200\nMedia General ....................\n3,191\n11,191\n250,400\nOgilvy & Mather International ....\n2,580\n12,833\n5,618,661\nR.

Below we show Sunday circulation in Buffalo in\nthe years prior to 1977 compared with the present period.\nIn\nthat earlier period the Sunday paper was the Courier-Express (the\nNews was not then publishing a Sunday paper).\nNow, of course, it\nis the News.\nAverage Sunday Circulation\n--------------------------\nYear\nCirculation\n----\n-----------\n1970\n314,000\n1971\n306,000\n1972\n302,000\n1973\n290,000\n1974\n278,000\n1975\n269,000\n1976\n270,000\n1984 (Current)\n376,000\nWe believe a papers penetration ratio to be the best\nmeasure of the strength of its franchise.\nPapers with unusually\nhigh penetration in the geographical area that is of prime\ninterest to major local retailers, and with relatively little\ncirculation elsewhere, are exceptionally efficient buys for those\nretailers.\nLow-penetration papers have a far less compelling\nmessage to present to advertisers.\nIn our opinion, three factors largely account for the\nunusual acceptance of the News in the community.\nAmong these,\npoints 2 and 3 also may explain the popularity of the Sunday News\ncompared to that of the Sunday Courier-Express when it was the\nsole Sunday paper:\n(1) The first point has nothing to do with merits of the\nNews.\nBoth emigration and immigration are relatively\nlow in Buffalo.\nA stable population is more interested\nand involved in the activities of its community than is\na shifting population - and, as a result, is more\ninterested in the content of the local daily paper.\nIncrease the movement in and out of a city and\npenetration ratios will fall.\n(2) The News has a reputation for editorial quality and\nintegrity that was honed by our longtime editor, the\nlegendary Alfred Kirchhofer, and that has been preserved\nand extended by Murray Light.\nThis reputation was\nenormously important to our success in establishing a\nSunday paper against entrenched competition.\nAnd without\na Sunday edition, the News would not have survived in the\nlong run.\n(3) The News lives up to its name - it delivers a very\nunusual amount of news.\nDuring 1983, our news hole\n(editorial material - not ads) amounted to 50% of the\nnewspapers content (excluding preprinted inserts).\nAmong papers that dominate their markets and that are of\ncomparable or larger size, we know of only one whose news\nhole percentage exceeds that of the News.\nComprehensive\nfigures are not available, but a sampling indicates an\naverage percentage in the high 30s.\nIn other words, page\nfor page, our mix gives readers over 25% more news than\nthe typical paper.\nThis news-rich mixture is by intent.\nSome publishers, pushing for higher profit margins, have\ncut their news holes during the past decade.\nWe have\nmaintained ours and will continue to do so.\nProperly\nwritten and edited, a full serving of news makes our\npaper more valuable to the reader and contributes to our\nunusual penetration ratio.\nDespite the strength of the News franchise, gains in ROP\nlinage (advertising printed within the newspaper pages as\ncontrasted to preprinted inserts) are going to be very difficult\nto achieve.\nWe had an enormous gain in preprints during 1983:\nlines rose from 9.3 million to 16.4 million, revenues from $3.6\nmillion to $8.1 million.\nThese gains are consistent with\nnational trends, but exaggerated in our case by business we\npicked up when the Courier-Express closed.\nOn balance, the shift from ROP to preprints has negative\neconomic implications for us.\nProfitability on preprints is less\nand the business is more subject to competition from alternative\nmeans of delivery.\nFurthermore, a reduction in ROP linage means\nless absolute space devoted to news (since the news hole\npercentage remains constant), thereby reducing the utility of the\npaper to the reader.\nStan Lipsey became Publisher of the Buffalo News at midyear\nupon the retirement of Henry Urban.\nHenry never flinched during\nthe dark days of litigation and losses following our introduction\nof the Sunday paper - an introduction whose wisdom was questioned\nby many in the newspaper business, including some within our own\nbuilding.\nHenry is admired by the Buffalo business community,\nhes admired by all who worked for him, and he is admired by\nCharlie and me.\nStan worked with Henry for several years, and\nhas worked for Berkshire Hathaway since 1969.\nHe has been\npersonally involved in all nuts-and-bolts aspects of the\nnewspaper business from editorial to circulation.\nWe couldnt do\nbetter.\nSees Candy Shops\nThe financial results at Sees continue to be exceptional.\nThe business possesses a valuable and solid consumer franchise\nand a manager equally valuable and solid.\nIn recent years Sees has encountered two important\nproblems, at least one of which is well on its way toward\nsolution.\nThat problem concerns costs, except those for raw\nmaterials.\nWe have enjoyed a break on raw material costs in\nrecent years though so, of course, have our competitors.\nOne of\nthese days we will get a nasty surprise in the opposite\ndirection.\nIn effect, raw material costs are largely beyond our\ncontrol since we will, as a matter of course, buy the finest\ningredients that we can, regardless of changes in their price\nlevels.\nWe regard product quality as sacred.\nBut other kinds of costs are more controllable, and it is in\nthis area that we have had problems.\nOn a per-pound basis, our\ncosts (not including those for raw materials) have increased in\nthe last few years at a rate significantly greater than the\nincrease in the general price level.\nIt is vital to our\ncompetitive position and profit potential that we reverse this\ntrend.\nIn recent months much better control over costs has been\nattained and we feel certain that our rate of growth in these\ncosts in 1984 will be below the rate of inflation.\nThis\nconfidence arises out of our long experience with the managerial\ntalents of Chuck Huggins.\nWe put Chuck in charge the day we took\nover, and his record has been simply extraordinary, as shown by\nthe following table:\n52-53 Week Year\nOperating\nNumber of\nNumber of\nEnded About\nSales\nProfits\nPounds of\nStores Open\nDecember 31\nRevenues\nAfter Taxes\nCandy Sold\nat Year End\n-------------------\n------------\n-----------\n----------\n-----------\n1983 (53 weeks) ...\n$133,531,000\n$13,699,000\n24,651,000\n207\n1982 ..............\n123,662,000\n11,875,000\n24,216,000\n202\n1981 ..............\n112,578,000\n10,779,000\n24,052,000\n199\n1980 ..............\n97,715,000\n7,547,000\n24,065,000\n191\n1979 ..............\n87,314,000\n6,330,000\n23,985,000\n188\n1978 ..............\n73,653,000\n6,178,000\n22,407,000\n182\n1977 ..............\n62,886,000\n6,154,000\n20,921,000\n179\n1976 (53 weeks) ...\n56,333,000\n5,569,000\n20,553,000\n173\n1975 ..............\n50,492,000\n5,132,000\n19,134,000\n172\n1974 ..............\n41,248,000\n3,021,000\n17,883,000\n170\n1973 ..............\n35,050,000\n1,940,000\n17,813,000\n169\n1972 ..............\n31,337,000\n2,083,000\n16,954,000\n167\nThe other problem we face, as the table suggests, is our\nrecent inability to achieve meaningful gains in pounds sold.\nThe\nindustry has the same problem.\nBut for many years we\noutperformed the industry in this respect and now we are not.\nThe poundage volume in our retail stores has been virtually\nunchanged each year for the past four, despite small increases\nevery year in the number of shops (and in distribution expense as\nwell).\nOf course, dollar volume has increased because we have\nraised prices significantly.\nBut we regard the most important\nmeasure of retail trends to be units sold per store rather than\ndollar volume.\nOn a same-store basis (counting only shops open\nthroughout both years) with all figures adjusted to a 52-week\nyear, poundage was down .8 of 1% during 1983.\nThis small decline\nwas our best same-store performance since 1979; the cumulative\ndecline since then has been about 8%.\nQuantity-order volume,\nabout 25% of our total, has plateaued in recent years following\nvery large poundage gains throughout the 1970s.\nWe are not sure to what extent this flat volume - both in\nthe retail shop area and the quantity order area - is due to our\npricing policies and to what extent it is due to static industry\nvolume, the recession, and the extraordinary share of market we\nalready enjoy in our primary marketing area.\nOur price increase\nfor 1984 is much more modest than has been the case in the past\nfew years, and we hope that next year we can report better volume\nfigures to you.\nBut we have no basis to forecast these.\nDespite the volume problem, Sees strengths are many and\nimportant.\nIn our primary marketing area, the West, our candy is\npreferred by an enormous margin to that of any competitor.\nIn\nfact, we believe most lovers of chocolate prefer it to candy\ncosting two or three times as much. (In candy, as in stocks,\nprice and value can differ; price is what you give, value is what\nyou get.) The quality of customer service in our shops - operated\nthroughout the country by us and not by franchisees is every bit\nas good as the product.\nCheerful, helpful personnel are as much\na trademark of Sees as is the logo on the box.\nThats no small\nachievement in a business that requires us to hire about 2000\nseasonal workers.\nWe know of no comparably-sized organization\nthat betters the quality of customer service delivered by Chuck\nHuggins and his associates.\nBecause we have raised prices so modestly in 1984, we expect\nSees profits this year to be about the same as in 1983.\nInsurance - Controlled Operations\nWe both operate insurance companies and have a large\neconomic interest in an insurance business we dont operate,\nGEICO.\nThe results for all can be summed up easily: in\naggregate, the companies we operate and whose underwriting\nresults reflect the consequences of decisions that were my\nresponsibility a few years ago, had absolutely terrible results.\nFortunately, GEICO, whose policies I do not influence, simply\nshot the lights out.\nThe inference you draw from this summary is\nthe correct one.\nI made some serious mistakes a few years ago\nthat came home to roost.\nThe industry had its worst underwriting year in a long time,\nas indicated by the table below:\nYearly Change\nCombined Ratio\nin Premiums\nafter Policy-\nWritten (%)\nholder Dividends\n-------------\n----------------\n1972 ....................\n10.2\n96.2\n1973 ....................\n8.0\n99.2\n1974 ....................\n6.2\n105.4\n1975 ....................\n11.0\n107.9\n1976 ....................\n21.9\n102.4\n1977 ....................\n19.8\n97.2\n1978 ....................\n12.8\n97.5\n1979 ....................\n10.3\n100.6\n1980 ....................\n6.0\n103.1\n1981 ....................\n3.9\n106.0\n1982 (Revised) ..........\n4.4\n109.7\n1983 (Estimated) ........\n4.6\n111.0\nSource: Bests Aggregates and Averages.\nBests data reflect the experience of practically the entire\nindustry, including stock, mutual, and reciprocal companies.\nThe\ncombined ratio represents total insurance costs (losses incurred\nplus expenses) compared to revenue from premiums; a ratio below\n100 indicates an underwriting profit and one above 100 indicates\na loss.\nFor the reasons outlined in last years report, we expect\nthe poor industry experience of 1983 to be more or less typical\nfor a good many years to come. (As Yogi Berra put it: It will be\ndeja vu all over again.) That doesnt mean we think the figures\nwont bounce around a bit; they are certain to.\nBut we believe\nit highly unlikely that the combined ratio during the balance of\nthe decade will average significantly below the 1981-1983 level.\nBased on our expectations regarding inflation - and we are as\npessimistic as ever on that front - industry premium volume must\ngrow about 10% annually merely to stabilize loss ratios at\npresent levels.\nOur own combined ratio in 1983 was 121.\nSince Mike Goldberg\nrecently took over most of the responsibility for the insurance\noperation, it would be nice for me if our shortcomings could be\nplaced at his doorstep rather than mine.\nBut unfortunately, as\nwe have often pointed out, the insurance business has a long\nlead-time.\nThough business policies may be changed and personnel\nimproved, a significant period must pass before the effects are\nseen.\n(This characteristic of the business enabled us to make a\ngreat deal of money in GEICO; we could picture what was likely to\nhappen well before it actually occurred.) So the roots of the\n1983 results are operating and personnel decisions made two or\nmore years back when I had direct managerial responsibility for\nthe insurance group.\nDespite our poor results overall, several of our managers\ndid truly outstanding jobs.\nRoland Miller guided the auto and\ngeneral liability business of National Indemnity Company and\nNational Fire and Marine Insurance Company to improved results,\nwhile those of competitors deteriorated.\nIn addition, Tom Rowley\nat Continental Divide Insurance - our fledgling Colorado\nhomestate company - seems certain to be a winner.\nMike found him\na little over a year ago, and he was an important acquisition.\nWe have become active recently - and hope to become much\nmore active - in reinsurance transactions where the buyers\noverriding concern should be the sellers long-term\ncreditworthiness.\nIn such transactions our premier financial\nstrength should make us the number one choice of both claimants\nand insurers who must rely on the reinsurers promises for a\ngreat many years to come.\nA major source of such business is structured settlements -\na procedure for settling losses under which claimants receive\nperiodic payments (almost always monthly, for life) rather than a\nsingle lump sum settlement.\nThis form of settlement has\nimportant tax advantages for the claimant and also prevents his\nsquandering a large lump-sum payment.\nFrequently, some inflation\nprotection is built into the settlement.\nUsually the claimant\nhas been seriously injured, and thus the periodic payments must\nbe unquestionably secure for decades to come.\nWe believe we\noffer unparalleled security.\nNo other insurer we know of - even\nthose with much larger gross assets - has our financial strength.\nWe also think our financial strength should recommend us to\ncompanies wishing to transfer loss reserves.\nIn such\ntransactions, other insurance companies pay us lump sums to\nassume all (or a specified portion of) future loss payments\napplicable to large blocks of expired business.\nHere also, the\ncompany transferring such claims needs to be certain of the\ntransferees financial strength for many years to come.\nAgain,\nmost of our competitors soliciting such business appear to us to\nhave a financial condition that is materially inferior to ours.\nPotentially, structured settlements and the assumption of\nloss reserves could become very significant to us.\nBecause of\ntheir potential size and because these operations generate large\namounts of investment income compared to premium volume, we will\nshow underwriting results from those businesses on a separate\nline in our insurance segment data.\nWe also will exclude their\neffect in reporting our combined ratio to you.\nWe front end no\nprofit on structured settlement or loss reserve transactions, and\nall attributable overhead is expensed currently.\nBoth businesses\nare run by Don Wurster at National Indemnity Company.\nInsurance - GEICO\nGeicos performance during 1983 was as good as our own\ninsurance performance was poor.\nCompared to the industrys\ncombined ratio of 111, GEICO wrote at 96 after a large voluntary\naccrual for policyholder dividends.\nA few years ago I would not\nhave thought GEICO could so greatly outperform the industry.\nIts\nsuperiority reflects the combination of a truly exceptional\nbusiness idea and an exceptional management.\nJack Byrne and Bill Snyder have maintained extraordinary\ndiscipline in the underwriting area (including, crucially,\nprovision for full and proper loss reserves), and their efforts\nare now being further rewarded by significant gains in new\nbusiness.\nEqually important, Lou Simpson is the class of the\nfield among insurance investment managers.\nThe three of them are\nsome team.\nWe have approximately a one-third interest in GEICO.\nThat\ngives us a $270 million share in the companys premium volume, an\namount some 80% larger than our own volume.\nThus, the major\nportion of our total insurance business comes from the best\ninsurance book in the country.\nThis fact does not moderate by an\niota the need for us to improve our own operation.\nStock Splits and Stock Activity\nWe often are asked why Berkshire does not split its stock.\nThe assumption behind this question usually appears to be that a\nsplit would be a pro-shareholder action.\nWe disagree.\nLet me\ntell you why.\nOne of our goals is to have Berkshire Hathaway stock sell at\na price rationally related to its intrinsic business value.\n(But\nnote rationally related, not identical: if well-regarded\ncompanies are generally selling in the market at large discounts\nfrom value, Berkshire might well be priced similarly.) The key to\na rational stock price is rational shareholders, both current and\nprospective.\nIf the holders of a companys stock and/or the prospective\nbuyers attracted to it are prone to make irrational or emotion-\nbased decisions, some pretty silly stock prices are going to\nappear periodically.\nManic-depressive personalities produce\nmanic-depressive valuations.\nSuch aberrations may help us in\nbuying and selling the stocks of other companies.\nBut we think\nit is in both your interest and ours to minimize their occurrence\nin the market for Berkshire.\nTo obtain only high quality shareholders is no cinch.\nMrs.\nAstor could select her 400, but anyone can buy any stock.\nEntering members of a shareholder club cannot be screened for\nintellectual capacity, emotional stability, moral sensitivity or\nacceptable dress.\nShareholder eugenics, therefore, might appear\nto be a hopeless undertaking.\nIn large part, however, we feel that high quality ownership\ncan be attracted and maintained if we consistently communicate\nour business and ownership philosophy - along with no other\nconflicting messages - and then let self selection follow its\ncourse.\nFor example, self selection will draw a far different\ncrowd to a musical event advertised as an opera than one\nadvertised as a rock concert even though anyone can buy a ticket\nto either.\nThrough our policies and communications - our\nadvertisements - we try to attract investors who will\nunderstand our operations, attitudes and expectations. (And,\nfully as important, we try to dissuade those who wont.) We want\nthose who think of themselves as business owners and invest in\ncompanies with the intention of staying a long time.\nAnd, we\nwant those who keep their eyes focused on business results, not\nmarket prices.\nInvestors possessing those characteristics are in a small\nminority, but we have an exceptional collection of them.\nI\nbelieve well over 90% - probably over 95% - of our shares are\nheld by those who were shareholders of Berkshire or Blue Chip\nfive years ago.\nAnd I would guess that over 95% of our shares\nare held by investors for whom the holding is at least double the\nsize of their next largest.\nAmong companies with at least\nseveral thousand public shareholders and more than $1 billion of\nmarket value, we are almost certainly the leader in the degree to\nwhich our shareholders think and act like owners.\nUpgrading a\nshareholder group that possesses these characteristics is not\neasy.\nWere we to split the stock or take other actions focusing on\nstock price rather than business value, we would attract an\nentering class of buyers inferior to the exiting class of\nsellers.\nAt $1300, there are very few investors who cant afford\na Berkshire share.\nWould a potential one-share purchaser be\nbetter off if we split 100 for 1 so he could buy 100 shares?\nThose who think so and who would buy the stock because of the\nsplit or in anticipation of one would definitely downgrade the\nquality of our present shareholder group. (Could we really\nimprove our shareholder group by trading some of our present\nclear-thinking members for impressionable new ones who,\npreferring paper to value, feel wealthier with nine $10 bills\nthan with one $100 bill?) People who buy for non-value reasons\nare likely to sell for non-value reasons.\nTheir presence in the\npicture will accentuate erratic price swings unrelated to\nunderlying business developments.\nWe will try to avoid policies that attract buyers with a\nshort-term focus on our stock price and try to follow policies\nthat attract informed long-term investors focusing on business\nvalues. just as you purchased your Berkshire shares in a market\npopulated by rational informed investors, you deserve a chance to\nsell - should you ever want to - in the same kind of market.\nWe\nwill work to keep it in existence.\nOne of the ironies of the stock market is the emphasis on\nactivity.\nBrokers, using terms such as marketability and\nliquidity, sing the praises of companies with high share\nturnover (those who cannot fill your pocket will confidently fill\nyour ear).\nBut investors should understand that what is good for\nthe croupier is not good for the customer.\nA hyperactive stock\nmarket is the pickpocket of enterprise.\nFor example, consider a typical company earning, say, 12% on\nequity.\nAssume a very high turnover rate in its shares of 100%\nper year.\nIf a purchase and sale of the stock each extract\ncommissions of 1% (the rate may be much higher on low-priced\nstocks) and if the stock trades at book value, the owners of our\nhypothetical company will pay, in aggregate, 2% of the companys\nnet worth annually for the privilege of transferring ownership.\nThis activity does nothing for the earnings of the business, and\nmeans that 1/6 of them are lost to the owners through the\nfrictional cost of transfer. (And this calculation does not\ncount option trading, which would increase frictional costs still\nfurther.)\nAll that makes for a rather expensive game of musical\nchairs.\nCan you imagine the agonized cry that would arise if a\ngovernmental unit were to impose a new 16 2/3% tax on earnings of\ncorporations or investors?\nBy market activity, investors can\nimpose upon themselves the equivalent of such a tax.\nDays when the market trades 100 million shares (and that\nkind of volume, when over-the-counter trading is included, is\ntoday abnormally low) are a curse for owners, not a blessing -\nfor they mean that owners are paying twice as much to change\nchairs as they are on a 50-million-share day.\nIf 100 million-\nshare days persist for a year and the average cost on each\npurchase and sale is 15 cents a share, the chair-changing tax for\ninvestors in aggregate would total about $7.5 billion - an amount\nroughly equal to the combined 1982 profits of Exxon, General\nMotors, Mobil and Texaco, the four largest companies in the\nFortune 500.\nThese companies had a combined net worth of $75 billion at\nyearend 1982 and accounted for over 12% of both net worth and net\nincome of the entire Fortune 500 list.\nUnder our assumption\ninvestors, in aggregate, every year forfeit all earnings from\nthis staggering sum of capital merely to satisfy their penchant\nfor financial flip-flopping.\nIn addition, investment\nmanagement fees of over $2 billion annually - sums paid for\nchair-changing advice - require the forfeiture by investors of\nall earnings of the five largest banking organizations (Citicorp,\nBank America, Chase Manhattan, Manufacturers Hanover and J. P.\nMorgan).\nThese expensive activities may decide who eats the pie,\nbut they dont enlarge it.\n(We are aware of the pie-expanding argument that says that\nsuch activities improve the rationality of the capital allocation\nprocess.\nWe think that this argument is specious and that, on\nbalance, hyperactive equity markets subvert rational capital\nallocation and act as pie shrinkers.\nAdam Smith felt that all\nnoncollusive acts in a free market were guided by an invisible\nhand that led an economy to maximum progress; our view is that\ncasino-type markets and hair-trigger investment management act as\nan invisible foot that trips up and slows down a forward-moving\neconomy.)\nContrast the hyperactive stock with Berkshire.\nThe bid-and-\nask spread in our stock currently is about 30 points, or a little\nover 2%.\nDepending on the size of the transaction, the\ndifference between proceeds received by the seller of Berkshire\nand cost to the buyer may range downward from 4% (in trading\ninvolving only a few shares) to perhaps 1 1/2% (in large trades\nwhere negotiation can reduce both the market-makers spread and\nthe brokers commission).\nBecause most Berkshire shares are\ntraded in fairly large transactions, the spread on all trading\nprobably does not average more than 2%.\nMeanwhile, true turnover in Berkshire stock (excluding\ninter-dealer transactions, gifts and bequests) probably runs 3%\nper year.\nThus our owners, in aggregate, are paying perhaps\n6/100 of 1% of Berkshires market value annually for transfer\nprivileges.\nBy this very rough estimate, thats $900,000 - not a\nsmall cost, but far less than average.\nSplitting the stock would\nincrease that cost, downgrade the quality of our shareholder\npopulation, and encourage a market price less consistently\nrelated to intrinsic business value.\nWe see no offsetting\nadvantages.\nMiscellaneous\nLast year in this section I ran a small ad to encourage\nacquisition candidates.\nIn our communications businesses we tell\nour advertisers that repetition is a key to results (which it\nis), so we will again repeat our acquisition criteria.\nWe prefer:\n(1) large purchases (at least $5 million of after-tax\nearnings),\n(2) demonstrated consistent earning power (future\nprojections are of little interest to us, nor are\nturn-around situations),\n(3) businesses earning good returns on equity while\nemploying little or no debt,\n(4) management in place (we cant supply it),\n(5) simple businesses (if theres lots of technology, we\nwont understand it),\n(6) an offering price (we dont want to waste our time or\nthat of the seller by talking, even preliminarily,\nabout a transaction when price is unknown).\nWe will not engage in unfriendly takeovers.\nWe can promise\ncomplete confidentiality and a very fast answer - customarily\nwithin five minutes - as to whether were interested.\nWe prefer\nto buy for cash, but will consider issuance of stock when we\nreceive as much in intrinsic business value as we give.\nWe\ninvite potential sellers to check us out by contacting people\nwith whom we have done business in the past.\nFor the right\nbusiness - and the right people - we can provide a good home.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nAbout 96.4% of all eligible shares participated in our 1983\nshareholder-designated contributions program.\nThe total\ncontributions made pursuant to this program - disbursed in the\nearly days of 1984 but fully expensed in 1983 - were $3,066,501,\nand 1353 charities were recipients.\nAlthough the response\nmeasured by the percentage of shares participating was\nextraordinarily good, the response measured by the percentage of\nholders participating was not as good.\nThe reason may well be\nthe large number of new shareholders acquired through the merger\nand their lack of familiarity with the program.\nWe urge new\nshareholders to read the description of the program on pages 52-\n53.\nIf you wish to participate in future programs, we strongly\nurge that you immediately make sure that your shares are\nregistered in the actual owners name, not in street or nominee\nname.\nShares not so registered on September 28, 1984 will not be\neligible for any 1984 program.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nThe Blue Chip/Berkshire merger went off without a hitch.\nLess than one-tenth of 1% of the shares of each company voted\nagainst the merger, and no requests for appraisal were made.\nIn\n1983, we gained some tax efficiency from the merger and we expect\nto gain more in the future.\nOne interesting sidelight to the merger: Berkshire now has\n1,146,909 shares outstanding compared to 1,137,778 shares at the\nbeginning of fiscal 1965, the year present management assumed\nresponsibility.\nFor every 1% of the company you owned at that\ntime, you now would own .99%. Thus, all of todays assets - the\nNews, Sees, Nebraska Furniture Mart, the Insurance Group, $1.3\nbillion in marketable stocks, etc. - have been added to the\noriginal textile assets with virtually no net dilution to the\noriginal owners.\nWe are delighted to have the former Blue Chip shareholders\njoin us.\nTo aid in your understanding of Berkshire Hathaway, we\nwill be glad to send you the Compendium of Letters from the\nAnnual Reports of 1977-1981, and/or the 1982 Annual report.\nDirect your request to the Company at 1440 Kiewit Plaza, Omaha,\nNebraska 68131.\nWarren E. Buffett\nMarch 14, 1984\nChairman of the Board\nAppendix\nAppendix\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nGoodwill and its Amortization:\nThe Rules and The Realities\nThis appendix deals only with economic and accounting Goodwill  not the goodwill of everyday usage.\nFor example, a business may be well liked, even loved, by most of its customers but possess no economic goodwill.\n(AT&T, before the breakup, was generally well thought of, but possessed not a dime of economic Goodwill.)\nAnd, regrettably, a business may be disliked by its customers but possess substantial, and growing, economic Goodwill.\nSo, just for the moment, forget emotions and focus only on economics and accounting.\nWhen a business is purchased, accounting principles require that the purchase price first be assigned to the fair value of the identifiable assets that are acquired.\nFrequently the sum of the fair values put on the assets (after the deduction of liabilities) is less than the total purchase price of the business.\nIn that case, the difference is assigned to an asset account entitled \"excess of cost over equity in net assets acquired\".\nTo avoid constant repetition of this mouthful, we will substitute \"Goodwill\".\nAccounting Goodwill arising from businesses purchased before November 1970 has a special standing.\nExcept under rare circumstances, it can remain an asset on the balance sheet as long as the business bought is retained.\nThat means no amortization charges to gradually extinguish that asset need be made against earnings.\nThe case is different, however, with purchases made from November 1970 on.\nWhen these create Goodwill, it must be amortized over not more than 40 years through charges  of equal amount in every year  to the earnings account.\nSince 40 years is the maximum period allowed, 40 years is what managements (including us) usually elect.\nThis annual charge to earnings is not allowed as a tax deduction and, thus, has an effect on after-tax income that is roughly double that of most other expenses.\nThats how accounting Goodwill works.\nTo see how it differs from economic reality, lets look at an example close at hand.\nWell round some figures, and greatly oversimplify, to make the example easier to follow.\nWell also mention some implications for investors and managers.\nBlue Chip Stamps bought Sees early in 1972 for $25 million, at which time Sees had about $8 million of net tangible assets.\n(Throughout this discussion, accounts receivable will be classified as tangible assets, a definition proper for business analysis.)\nThis level of tangible assets was adequate to conduct the business without use of debt, except for short periods seasonally.\nSees was earning about $2 million after tax at the time, and such earnings seemed conservatively representative of future earning power in constant 1972 dollars.\nThus our first lesson:\nbusinesses logically are worth far more than net tangible assets when they can be expected to produce earnings on such assets considerably in excess of market rates of return.\nThe capitalized value of this excess return is economic Goodwill.\nIn 1972 (and now) relatively few businesses could be expected to consistently earn the 25% after tax on net tangible assets that was earned by Sees  doing it, furthermore, with conservative accounting and no financial leverage.\nIt was not the fair market value of the inventories, receivables or fixed assets that produced the premium rates of return.\nRather it was a combination of intangible assets, particularly a pervasive favorable reputation with consumers based upon countless pleasant experiences they have had with both product and personnel.\nSuch a reputation creates a consumer franchise that allows the value of the product to the purchaser, rather than its production cost, to be the major determinant of selling price.\nConsumer franchises are a prime source of economic Goodwill.\nOther sources include governmental franchises not subject to profit regulation, such as television stations, and an enduring position as the low cost producer in an industry.\nLets return to the accounting in the Sees example.\nBlue Chips purchase of Sees at $17 million over net tangible assets required that a Goodwill account of this amount be established as an asset on Blue Chips books and that $425,000 be charged to income annually for 40 years to amortize that asset.\nBy 1983, after 11 years of such charges, the $17 million had been reduced to about $12.5 million.\nBerkshire, meanwhile, owned 60% of Blue Chip and, therefore, also 60% of Sees.\nThis ownership meant that Berkshires balance sheet reflected 60% of Sees Goodwill, or about $7.5 million.\nIn 1983 Berkshire acquired the rest of Blue Chip in a merger that required purchase accounting as contrasted to the \"pooling\" treatment allowed for some mergers.\nUnder purchase accounting, the \"fair value\" of the shares we gave to (or \"paid\") Blue Chip holders had to be spread over the net assets acquired from Blue Chip.\nThis \"fair value\" was measured, as it almost always is when public companies use their shares to make acquisitions, by the market value of the shares given up.\nThe assets \"purchased\" consisted of 40% of everything owned by Blue Chip (as noted, Berkshire already owned the other 60%).\nWhat Berkshire \"paid\" was more than the net identifiable assets we received by $51.7 million, and was assigned to two pieces of Goodwill:\n$28.4 million to Sees and $23.3 million to Buffalo Evening News.\nAfter the merger, therefore, Berkshire was left with a Goodwill asset for Sees that had two components:\nthe $7.5 million remaining from the 1971 purchase, and $28.4 million newly created by the 40% \"purchased\" in 1983.\nOur amortization charge now will be about $1.0 million for the next 28 years, and $.7 million for the following 12 years, 2002 through 2013.\nIn other words, different purchase dates and prices have given us vastly different asset values and amortization charges for two pieces of the same asset.\n(We repeat our usual disclaimer:\nwe have no better accounting system to suggest.\nThe problems to be dealt with are mind boggling and require arbitrary rules.)\nBut what are the economic realities?\nOne reality is that the amortization charges that have been deducted as costs in the earnings statement each year since acquisition of Sees were not true economic costs.\nWe know that because Sees last year earned $13 million after taxes on about $20 million of net tangible assets  a performance indicating the existence of economic Goodwill far larger than the total original cost of our accounting Goodwill.\nIn other words, while accounting Goodwill regularly decreased from the moment of purchase, economic Goodwill increased in irregular but very substantial fashion.\nAnother reality is that annual amortization charges in the future will not correspond to economic costs.\nIt is possible, of course, that Sees economic Goodwill will disappear.\nBut it wont shrink in even decrements or anything remotely resembling them.\nWhat is more likely is that the Goodwill will increase  in current, if not in constant, dollars  because of inflation.\nThat probability exists because true economic Goodwill tends to rise in nominal value proportionally with inflation.\nTo illustrate how this works, lets contrast a Sees kind of business with a more mundane business.\nWhen we purchased Sees in 1972, it will be recalled, it was earning about $2 million on $8 million of net tangible assets.\nLet us assume that our hypothetical mundane business then had $2 million of earnings also, but needed $18 million in net tangible assets for normal operations.\nEarning only 11% on required tangible assets, that mundane business would possess little or no economic Goodwill.\nA business like that, therefore, might well have sold for the value of its net tangible assets, or for $18 million.\nIn contrast, we paid $25 million for Sees, even though it had no more in earnings and less than half as much in \"honest-to-God\" assets.\nCould less really have been more, as our purchase price implied?\nThe answer is \"yes\"  even if both businesses were expected to have flat unit volume  as long as you anticipated, as we did in 1972, a world of continuous inflation.\nTo understand why, imagine the effect that a doubling of the price level would subsequently have on the two businesses.\nBoth would need to double their nominal earnings to $4 million to keep themselves even with inflation.\nThis would seem to be no great trick:\njust sell the same number of units at double earlier prices and, assuming profit margins remain unchanged, profits also must double.\nBut, crucially, to bring that about, both businesses probably would have to double their nominal investment in net tangible assets, since that is the kind of economic requirement that inflation usually imposes on businesses, both good and bad.\nA doubling of dollar sales means correspondingly more dollars must be employed immediately in receivables and inventories.\nDollars employed in fixed assets will respond more slowly to inflation, but probably just as surely.\nAnd all of this inflation-required investment will produce no improvement in rate of return.\nThe motivation for this investment is the survival of the business, not the prosperity of the owner.\nRemember, however, that Sees had net tangible assets of only $8 million.\nSo it would only have had to commit an additional $8 million to finance the capital needs imposed by inflation.\nThe mundane business, meanwhile, had a burden over twice as large  a need for $18 million of additional capital.\nAfter the dust had settled, the mundane business, now earning $4 million annually, might still be worth the value of its tangible assets, or $36 million.\nThat means its owners would have gained only a dollar of nominal value for every new dollar invested.\n(This is the same dollar-for-dollar result they would have achieved if they had added money to a savings account.)\nSees, however, also earning $4 million, might be worth $50 million if valued (as it logically would be) on the same basis as it was at the time of our purchase.\nSo it would have gained $25 million in nominal value while the owners were putting up only $8 million in additional capital  over $3 of nominal value gained for each $1 invested.\nRemember, even so, that the owners of the Sees kind of business were forced by inflation to ante up $8 million in additional capital just to stay even in real profits.\nAny unleveraged business that requires some net tangible assets to operate (and almost all do) is hurt by inflation.\nBusinesses needing little in the way of tangible assets simply are hurt the least.\nAnd that fact, of course, has been hard for many people to grasp.\nFor years the traditional wisdom  long on tradition, short on wisdom  held that inflation protection was best provided by businesses laden with natural resources, plants and machinery, or other tangible assets (\"In Goods We Trust\").\nIt doesnt work that way.\nAsset-heavy businesses generally earn low rates of return  rates that often barely provide enough capital to fund the inflationary needs of the existing business, with nothing left over for real growth, for distribution to owners, or for acquisition of new businesses.\nIn contrast, a disproportionate number of the great business fortunes built up during the inflationary years arose from ownership of operations that combined intangibles of lasting value with relatively minor requirements for tangible assets.\nIn such cases earnings have bounded upward in nominal dollars, and these dollars have been largely available for the acquisition of additional businesses.\nThis phenomenon has been particularly evident in the communications business.\nThat business has required little in the way of tangible investment  yet its franchises have endured.\nDuring inflation, Goodwill is the gift that keeps giving.\nBut that statement applies, naturally, only to true economic Goodwill.\nSpurious accounting Goodwill  and there is plenty of it around  is another matter.\nWhen an overexcited management purchases a business at a silly price, the same accounting niceties described earlier are observed.\nBecause it cant go anywhere else, the silliness ends up in the Goodwill account.\nConsidering the lack of managerial discipline that created the account, under such circumstances it might better be labeled \"No-Will\".\nWhatever the term, the 40-year ritual typically is observed and the adrenalin so capitalized remains on the books as an \"asset\" just as if the acquisition had been a sensible one.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nIf you cling to any belief that accounting treatment of Goodwill is the best measure of economic reality, I suggest one final item to ponder.\nAssume a company with $20 per share of net worth, all tangible assets.\nFurther assume the company has internally developed some magnificent consumer franchise, or that it was fortunate enough to obtain some important television stations by original FCC grant.\nTherefore, it earns a great deal on tangible assets, say $5 per share, or 25%.\nWith such economics, it might sell for $100 per share or more, and it might well also bring that price in a negotiated sale of the entire business.\nAssume an investor buys the stock at $100 per share, paying in effect $80 per share for Goodwill (just as would a corporate purchaser buying the whole company).\nShould the investor impute a $2 per share amortization charge annually ($80 divided by 40 years) to calculate \"true\" earnings per share?\nAnd, if so, should the new \"true\" earnings of $3 per share cause him to rethink his purchase price?\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nWe believe managers and investors alike should view intangible assets from two perspectives:\nIn analysis of operating results  that is, in evaluating the underlying economics of a business unit  amortization charges should be ignored.\nWhat a business can be expected to earn on unleveraged net tangible assets, excluding any charges against earnings for amortization of Goodwill, is the best guide to the economic attractiveness of the operation.\nIt is also the best guide to the current value of the operations economic Goodwill.\nIn evaluating the wisdom of business acquisitions, amortization charges should be ignored also.\nThey should be deducted neither from earnings nor from the cost of the business.\nThis means forever viewing purchased Goodwill at its full cost, before any amortization.\nFurthermore, cost should be defined as including the full intrinsic business value  not just the recorded accounting value  of all consideration given, irrespective of market prices of the securities involved at the time of merger and irrespective of whether pooling treatment was allowed.\nFor example, what we truly paid in the Blue Chip merger for 40% of the Goodwill of Sees and the News was considerably more than the $51.7 million entered on our books.\nThis disparity exists because the market value of the Berkshire shares given up in the merger was less than their intrinsic business value, which is the value that defines the true cost to us.\nOperations that appear to be winners based upon perspective (1) may pale when viewed from perspective (2).\nA good business is not always a good purchase  although its a good place to look for one.\nWe will try to acquire businesses that have excellent operating economics measured by (1) and that provide reasonable returns measured by (2).\nAccounting consequences will be totally ignored.\nAt yearend 1983, net Goodwill on our accounting books totaled $62 million, consisting of the $79 million you see stated on the asset side of our balance sheet, and $17 million of negative Goodwill that is offset against the carrying value of our interest in Mutual Savings and Loan.\nWe believe net economic Goodwill far exceeds the $62 million accounting number.\n_____________",

(Hows that for a strategic plan?)\nSources of Reported Earnings\nThe table on the following page shows the sources of\nBerkshires reported earnings.\nBerkshires net ownership\ninterest in many of the constituent businesses changed at midyear\n1983 when the Blue Chip merger took place.\nBecause of these\nchanges, the first two columns of the table provide the best\nmeasure of underlying business performance.\nAll of the significant gains and losses attributable to\nunusual sales of assets by any of the business entities are\naggregated with securities transactions on the line near the\nbottom of the table, and are not included in operating earnings.\n(We regard any annual figure for realized capital gains or losses\nas meaningless, but we regard the aggregate realized and\nunrealized capital gains over a period of years as very\nimportant.)\nFurthermore, amortization of Goodwill is not charged against\nthe specific businesses but, for reasons outlined in the Appendix\nto my letter in the 1983 annual report, is set forth as a\nseparate item.\n(000s omitted)\n----------------------------------------------------------\nNet Earnings\nEarnings Before Income Taxes\nAfter Tax\n--------------------------------------\n------------------\nTotal\nBerkshire Share\nBerkshire Share\n------------------\n------------------\n------------------\n1984\n1983\n1984\n1983\n1984\n1983\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nOperating Earnings:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting ............ $(48,060) $(33,872) $(48,060) $(33,872) $(25,955) $(18,400)\nNet Investment Income ...\n68,903\n43,810\n68,903\n43,810\n62,059\n39,114\nBuffalo News ..............\n27,328\n19,352\n27,328\n16,547\n13,317\n8,832\nNebraska Furniture Mart(1)\n14,511\n3,812\n11,609\n3,049\n5,917\n1,521\nSees Candies .............\n26,644\n27,411\n26,644\n24,526\n13,380\n12,212\nAssociated Retail Stores ..\n(1,072)\n697\n(1,072)\n697\n(579)\n355\nBlue Chip Stamps(2)\n(1,843)\n(1,422)\n(1,843)\n(1,876)\n(899)\n(353)\nMutual Savings and Loan ...\n1,456\n(798)\n1,166\n(467)\n3,151\n1,917\nPrecision Steel ...........\n4,092\n3,241\n3,278\n2,102\n1,696\n1,136\nTextiles ..................\n418\n(100)\n418\n(100)\n226\n(63)\nWesco Financial ...........\n9,777\n7,493\n7,831\n4,844\n4,828\n3,448\nAmortization of Goodwill ..\n(1,434)\n(532)\n(1,434)\n(563)\n(1,434)\n(563)\nInterest on Debt ..........\n(14,734)\n(15,104)\n(14,097)\n(13,844)\n(7,452)\n(7,346)\nShareholder-Designated\nContributions ..........\n(3,179)\n(3,066)\n(3,179)\n(3,066)\n(1,716)\n(1,656)\nOther .....................\n4,932\n10,121\n4,529\n9,623\n3,476\n8,490\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nOperating Earnings ..........\n87,739\n61,043\n82,021\n51,410\n70,015\n48,644\nSpecial GEICO Distribution ..\n--\n19,575\n--\n19,575\n--\n18,224\nSpecial Gen.

Both the Omaha office of Peat\nMarwick and the reviewing Chicago partner, without objection,\nconcurred with our dividend presentation.\nIn 1984, we had a virtually identical transaction with\nGeneral Foods.\nThe only difference was that General Foods\nrepurchased its stock over a period of time in the open market,\nwhereas GEICO had made a one-shot tender offer.\nIn the General\nFoods case we sold to the company, on each day that it\nrepurchased shares, a quantity of shares that left our ownership\npercentage precisely unchanged.\nAgain our transaction was\npursuant to a written contract executed before repurchases began.\nAnd again the money we received was far less than the retained\nearnings that had inured to our ownership interest since our\npurchase.\nOverall we received $21,843,601 in cash from General\nFoods, and our ownership remained at exactly 8.75%.\nAt this point the New York office of Peat Marwick came into\nthe picture.\nLate in 1984 it indicated that it disagreed with\nthe conclusions of the firms Omaha office and Chicago reviewing\npartner.\nThe New York view was that the GEICO and General Foods\ntransactions should be treated as sales of stock by Berkshire\nrather than as the receipt of dividends.\nUnder this accounting\napproach, a portion of the cost of our investment in the stock of\neach company would be charged against the redemption payment and\nany gain would be shown as a capital gain, not as dividend\nincome.\nThis is an accounting approach only, having no bearing\non taxes: Peat Marwick agrees that the transactions were\ndividends for IRS purposes.\nWe disagree with the New York position from both the\nviewpoint of economic substance and proper accounting.\nBut, to\navoid a qualified auditors opinion, we have adopted herein Peat\nMarwicks 1984 view and restated 1983 accordingly.\nNone of this,\nhowever, has any effect on intrinsic business value: our\nownership interests in GEICO and General Foods, our cash, our\ntaxes, and the market value and tax basis of our holdings all\nremain the same.\nThis year we have again entered into a contract with General\nFoods whereby we will sell them shares concurrently with open\nmarket purchases that they make.\nThe arrangement provides that\nour ownership interest will remain unchanged at all times.\nBy\nkeeping it so, we will insure ourselves dividend treatment for\ntax purposes.\nIn our view also, the economic substance of this\ntransaction again is the creation of dividend income.\nHowever,\nwe will account for the redemptions as sales of stock rather than\ndividend income unless accounting rules are adopted that speak\ndirectly to this point.\nWe will continue to prominently identify\nany such special transactions in our reports to you.\nWhile we enjoy a low tax charge on these proportionate\nredemptions, and have participated in several of them, we view\nsuch repurchases as at least equally favorable for shareholders\nwho do not sell.\nWhen companies with outstanding businesses and\ncomfortable financial positions find their shares selling far\nbelow intrinsic value in the marketplace, no alternative action\ncan benefit shareholders as surely as repurchases.\n(Our endorsement of repurchases is limited to those dictated\nby price/value relationships and does not extend to the\ngreenmail repurchase - a practice we find odious and repugnant.\nIn these transactions, two parties achieve their personal ends by\nexploitation of an innocent and unconsulted third party.\nThe\nplayers are: (1) the shareholder extortionist who, even before\nthe ink on his stock certificate dries, delivers his your-\nmoney-or-your-life message to managers; (2) the corporate\ninsiders who quickly seek peace at any price - as long as the\nprice is paid by someone else; and (3) the shareholders whose\nmoney is used by (2) to make (1) go away.\nAs the dust settles,\nthe mugging, transient shareholder gives his speech on free\nenterprise, the muggee management gives its speech on the best\ninterests of the company, and the innocent shareholder standing\nby mutely funds the payoff.)\nThe companies in which we have our largest investments have\nall engaged in significant stock repurhases at times when wide\ndiscrepancies existed between price and value.\nAs shareholders,\nwe find this encouraging and rewarding for two important reasons\n- one that is obvious, and one that is subtle and not always\nunderstood.\nThe obvious point involves basic arithmetic: major\nrepurchases at prices well below per-share intrinsic business\nvalue immediately increase, in a highly significant way, that\nvalue.\nWhen companies purchase their own stock, they often find\nit easy to get $2 of present value for $1.\nCorporate acquisition\nprograms almost never do as well and, in a discouragingly large\nnumber of cases, fail to get anything close to $1 of value for\neach $1 expended.\nThe other benefit of repurchases is less subject to precise\nmeasurement but can be fully as important over time.\nBy making\nrepurchases when a companys market value is well below its\nbusiness value, management clearly demonstrates that it is given\nto actions that enhance the wealth of shareholders, rather than\nto actions that expand managements domain but that do nothing\nfor (or even harm) shareholders.\nSeeing this, shareholders and\npotential shareholders increase their estimates of future returns\nfrom the business.\nThis upward revision, in turn, produces\nmarket prices more in line with intrinsic business value.\nThese\nprices are entirely rational.\nInvestors should pay more for a\nbusiness that is lodged in the hands of a manager with\ndemonstrated pro-shareholder leanings than for one in the hands\nof a self-interested manager marching to a different drummer. (To\nmake the point extreme, how much would you pay to be a minority\nshareholder of a company controlled by Robert Wesco?)\nThe key word is demonstrated.\nA manager who consistently\nturns his back on repurchases, when these clearly are in the\ninterests of owners, reveals more than he knows of his\nmotivations.\nNo matter how often or how eloquently he mouths\nsome public relations-inspired phrase such as maximizing\nshareholder wealth (this seasons favorite), the market\ncorrectly discounts assets lodged with him.\nHis heart is not\nlistening to his mouth - and, after a while, neither will the\nmarket.\nWe have prospered in a very major way - as have other\nshareholders - by the large share repurchases of GEICO,\nWashington Post, and General Foods, our three largest holdings.\n(Exxon, in which we have our fourth largest holding, has also\nwisely and aggressively repurchased shares but, in this case, we\nhave only recently established our position.) In each of these\ncompanies, shareholders have had their interests in outstanding\nbusinesses materially enhanced by repurchases made at bargain\nprices.\nWe feel very comfortable owning interests in businesses\nsuch as these that offer excellent economics combined with\nshareholder-conscious managements.\nThe following table shows our 1984 yearend net holdings in\nmarketable equities.\nAll numbers exclude the interests\nattributable to minority shareholders of Wesco and Nebraska\nFurniture Mart.\nNo. of Shares\nCost\nMarket\n-------------\n----------\n----------\n(000s omitted)\n690,975\nAffiliated Publications, Inc. .......\n$\n3,516\n$\n32,908\n740,400\nAmerican Broadcasting Companies, Inc.\n44,416\n46,738\n3,895,710\nExxon Corporation ...................\n173,401\n175,307\n4,047,191\nGeneral Foods Corporation ...........\n149,870\n226,137\n6,850,000\nGEICO Corporation ...................\n45,713\n397,300\n2,379,200\nHandy & Harman ......................\n27,318\n38,662\n818,872\nInterpublic Group of Companies, Inc.\n2,570\n28,149\n555,949\nNorthwest Industries\n26,581\n27,242\n2,553,488\nTime, Inc. ..........................\n89,327\n109,162\n1,868,600\nThe Washington Post Company .........\n10,628\n149,955\n----------\n----------\n$573,340\n$1,231,560\nAll Other Common Stockholdings\n11,634\n37,326\n----------\n----------\nTotal Common Stocks\n$584,974\n$1,268,886\n==========\n==========\nIts been over ten years since it has been as difficult as\nnow to find equity investments that meet both our qualitative\nstandards and our quantitative standards of value versus price.\nWe try to avoid compromise of these standards, although we find\ndoing nothing the most difficult task of all.

(They are in good company.)\nThe Blumkin blood did not run thin.\nLouie, Mrs. Bs son,\nand his three boys, Ron, Irv, and Steve, all contribute in full\nmeasure to NFMs amazing success.\nThe younger generation has\nattended the best business school of them all - that conducted by\nMrs. B and Louie - and their training is evident in their\nperformance.\nLast year NFMs net sales increased by $14.3 million,\nbringing the total to $115 million, all from the one store in\nOmaha.\nThat is by far the largest volume produced by a single\nhome furnishings store in the United States.\nIn fact, the gain\nin sales last year was itself greater than the annual volume of\nmany good-sized successful stores.\nThe business achieves this\nsuccess because it deserves this success.\nA few figures will\ntell you why.\nIn its fiscal 1984 10-K, the largest independent specialty\nretailer of home furnishings in the country, Levitz Furniture,\ndescribed its prices as generally lower than the prices charged\nby conventional furniture stores in its trading area.\nLevitz,\nin that year, operated at a gross margin of 44.4% (that is, on\naverage, customers paid it $100 for merchandise that had cost it\n$55.60 to buy).\nThe gross margin at NFM is not much more than\nhalf of that.\nNFMs low mark-ups are possible because of its\nexceptional efficiency: operating expenses (payroll, occupancy,\nadvertising, etc.) are about 16.5% of sales versus 35.6% at\nLevitz.\nNone of this is in criticism of Levitz, which has a well-\nmanaged operation.\nBut the NFM operation is simply extraordinary\n(and, remember, it all comes from a $500 investment by Mrs. B in\n1937).\nBy unparalleled efficiency and astute volume purchasing,\nNFM is able to earn excellent returns on capital while saving its\ncustomers at least $30 million annually from what, on average, it\nwould cost them to buy the same merchandise at stores maintaining\ntypical mark-ups.\nSuch savings enable NFM to constantly widen\nits geographical reach and thus to enjoy growth well beyond the\nnatural growth of the Omaha market.\nI have been asked by a number of people just what secrets\nthe Blumkins bring to their business.\nThese are not very\nesoteric.\nAll members of the family: (1) apply themselves with\nan enthusiasm and energy that would make Ben Franklin and Horatio\nAlger look like dropouts; (2) define with extraordinary realism\ntheir area of special competence and act decisively on all\nmatters within it; (3) ignore even the most enticing propositions\nfailing outside of that area of special competence; and, (4)\nunfailingly behave in a high-grade manner with everyone they deal\nwith. (Mrs.\nB boils it down to sell cheap and tell the truth.)\nOur evaluation of the integrity of Mrs. B and her family was\ndemonstrated when we purchased 90% of the business: NFM had never\nhad an audit and we did not request one; we did not take an\ninventory nor verify the receivables; we did not check property\ntitles.\nWe gave Mrs. B a check for $55 million and she gave us\nher word.\nThat made for an even exchange.\nYou and I are fortunate to be in partnership with the\nBlumkin family.\nSees Candy Shops, Inc.\nBelow is our usual recap of Sees performance since the time\nof purchase by Blue Chip Stamps:\n52-53 Week Year\nOperating\nNumber of\nNumber of\nEnded About\nSales\nProfits\nPounds of\nStores Open\nDecember 31\nRevenues\nAfter Taxes\nCandy Sold\nat Year End\n-------------------\n------------\n-----------\n----------\n-----------\n1984 ..............\n$135,946,000\n$13,380,000\n24,759,000\n214\n1983 (53 weeks) ...\n133,531,000\n13,699,000\n24,651,000\n207\n1982 ..............\n123,662,000\n11,875,000\n24,216,000\n202\n1981 ..............\n112,578,000\n10,779,000\n24,052,000\n199\n1980 ..............\n97,715,000\n7,547,000\n24,065,000\n191\n1979 ..............\n87,314,000\n6,330,000\n23,985,000\n188\n1978 ..............\n73,653,000\n6,178,000\n22,407,000\n182\n1977 ..............\n62,886,000\n6,154,000\n20,921,000\n179\n1976 (53 weeks) ...\n56,333,000\n5,569,000\n20,553,000\n173\n1975 ..............\n50,492,000\n5,132,000\n19,134,000\n172\n1974 ..............\n41,248,000\n3,021,000\n17,883,000\n170\n1973 ..............\n35,050,000\n1,940,000\n17,813,000\n169\n1972 ..............\n31,337,000\n2,083,000\n16,954,000\n167\nThis performance has not been produced by a generally rising\ntide.\nTo the contrary, many well-known participants in the\nboxed-chocolate industry either have lost money in this same\nperiod or have been marginally profitable.\nTo our knowledge,\nonly one good-sized competitor has achieved high profitability.\nThe success of Sees reflects the combination of an exceptional\nproduct and an exceptional manager, Chuck Huggins.\nDuring 1984 we increased prices considerably less than has\nbeen our practice in recent years: per-pound realization was\n$5.49, up only 1.4% from 1983.\nFortunately, we made good\nprogress on cost control, an area that has caused us problems in\nrecent years.\nPer-pound costs - other than those for raw\nmaterials, a segment of expense largely outside of our control -\nincreased by only 2.2% last year.\nOur cost-control problem has been exacerbated by the problem\nof modestly declining volume (measured by pounds, not dollars) on\na same-store basis.\nTotal pounds sold through shops in recent\nyears has been maintained at a roughly constant level only by the\nnet addition of a few shops annually.\nThis more-shops-to-get-\nthe-same-volume situation naturally puts heavy pressure on per-\npound selling costs.\nIn 1984, same-store volume declined 1.1%. Total shop volume,\nhowever, grew 0.6% because of an increase in stores. (Both\npercentages are adjusted to compensate for a 53-week fiscal year\nin 1983.)\nSees business tends to get a bit more seasonal each year.\nIn the four weeks prior to Christmas, we do 40% of the years\nvolume and earn about 75% of the years profits.\nWe also earn\nsignificant sums in the Easter and Valentines Day periods, but\npretty much tread water the rest of the year.\nIn recent years,\nshop volume at Christmas has grown in relative importance, and so\nhave quantity orders and mail orders.\nThe increased\nconcentration of business in the Christmas period produces a\nmultitude of managerial problems, all of which have been handled\nby Chuck and his associates with exceptional skill and grace.\nTheir solutions have in no way involved compromises in\neither quality of service or quality of product.\nMost of our\nlarger competitors could not say the same.\nThough faced with\nsomewhat less extreme peaks and valleys in demand than we, they\nadd preservatives or freeze the finished product in order to\nsmooth the production cycle and thereby lower unit costs.\nWe\nreject such techniques, opting, in effect, for production\nheadaches rather than product modification.\nOur mall stores face a host of new food and snack vendors\nthat provide particularly strong competition at non-holiday\nperiods.\nWe need new products to fight back and during 1984 we\nintroduced six candy bars that, overall, met with a good\nreception.\nFurther product introductions are planned.\nIn 1985 we will intensify our efforts to keep per-pound cost\nincreases below the rate of inflation.\nContinued success in\nthese efforts, however, will require gains in same-store\npoundage.\nPrices in 1985 should average 6% - 7% above those of\n1984.\nAssuming no change in same-store volume, profits should\nshow a moderate gain.\nBuffalo Evening News\nProfits at the News in 1984 were considerably greater than\nwe expected.\nAs at Sees, excellent progress was made in\ncontrolling costs.\nExcluding hours worked in the newsroom, total\nhours worked decreased by about 2.8%. With this productivity\nimprovement, overall costs increased only 4.9%. This performance\nby Stan Lipsey and his management team was one of the best in the\nindustry.\nHowever, we now face an acceleration in costs.\nIn mid-1984\nwe entered into new multi-year union contracts that provided for\na large catch-up wage increase.\nThis catch-up is entirely\nappropriate: the cooperative spirit of our unions during the\nunprofitable 1977-1982 period was an important factor in our\nsuccess in remaining cost competitive with The Courier-Express.\nHad we not kept costs down, the outcome of that struggle might\nwell have been different.\nBecause our new union contracts took effect at varying\ndates, little of the catch-up increase was reflected in our 1984\ncosts.\nBut the increase will be almost totally effective in 1985\nand, therefore, our unit labor costs will rise this year at a\nrate considerably greater than that of the industry.\nWe expect\nto mitigate this increase by continued small gains in\nproductivity, but we cannot avoid significantly higher wage costs\nthis year.\nNewsprint price trends also are less favorable now\nthan they were in 1984.\nPrimarily because of these two factors,\nwe expect at least a minor contraction in margins at the News.\nWorking in our favor at the News are two factors of major\neconomic importance:\n(1) Our circulation is concentrated to an unusual degree\nin the area of maximum utility to our advertisers.\nRegional newspapers with wide-ranging circulation, on\nthe other hand, have a significant portion of their\ncirculation in areas that are of negligible utility to\nmost advertisers.\nA subscriber several hundred miles\naway is not much of a prospect for the puppy you are\noffering to sell via a classified ad - nor for the\ngrocer with stores only in the metropolitan area.\nWasted circulation - as the advertisers call it -\nhurts profitability: expenses of a newspaper are\ndetermined largely by gross circulation while\nadvertising revenues (usually 70% - 80% of total\nrevenues) are responsive only to useful circulation;\n(2) Our penetration of the Buffalo retail market is\nexceptional; advertisers can reach almost all of their\npotential customers using only the News.\nLast year I told you about this unusual reader acceptance:\namong the 100 largest newspapers in the country, we were then\nnumber one, daily, and number three, Sunday, in penetration.\nThe\nmost recent figures show us number one in penetration on weekdays\nand number two on Sunday.\n(Even so, the number of households in\nBuffalo has declined, so our current weekday circulation is down\nslightly; on Sundays it is unchanged.)\nI told you also that one of the major reasons for this\nunusual acceptance by readers was the unusual quantity of news\nthat we delivered to them: a greater percentage of our paper is\ndevoted to news than is the case at any other dominant paper in\nour size range.\nIn 1984 our news hole ratio was 50.9%, (versus\n50.4% in 1983), a level far above the typical 35% - 40%.\nWe will\ncontinue to maintain this ratio in the 50% area.\nAlso, though we\nlast year reduced total hours worked in other departments, we\nmaintained the level of employment in the newsroom and, again,\nwill continue to do so.\nNewsroom costs advanced 9.1% in 1984, a\nrise far exceeding our overall cost increase of 4.9%.\nOur news hole policy costs us significant extra money for\nnewsprint.\nAs a result, our news costs (newsprint for the news\nhole plus payroll and expenses of the newsroom) as a percentage\nof revenue run higher than those of most dominant papers of our\nsize.\nThere is adequate room, however, for our paper or any\nother dominant paper to sustain these costs: the difference\nbetween high and low news costs at papers of comparable size\nruns perhaps three percentage points while pre-tax profit margins\nare often ten times that amount.\nThe economics of a dominant newspaper are excellent, among\nthe very best in the business world.\nOwners, naturally, would\nlike to believe that their wonderful profitability is achieved\nonly because they unfailingly turn out a wonderful product.\nThat\ncomfortable theory wilts before an uncomfortable fact.\nWhile\nfirst-class newspapers make excellent profits, the profits of\nthird-rate papers are as good or better - as long as either class\nof paper is dominant within its community.\nOf course, product\nquality may have been crucial to the paper in achieving\ndominance.\nWe believe this was the case at the News, in very\nlarge part because of people such as Alfred Kirchhofer who\npreceded us.\nOnce dominant, the newspaper itself, not the marketplace,\ndetermines just how good or how bad the paper will be.\nGood or\nbad, it will prosper.\nThat is not true of most businesses:\ninferior quality generally produces inferior economics.\nBut even\na poor newspaper is a bargain to most citizens simply because of\nits bulletin board value.\nOther things being equal, a poor\nproduct will not achieve quite the level of readership achieved\nby a first-class product.\nA poor product, however, will still\nremain essential to most citizens, and what commands their\nattention will command the attention of advertisers.\nSince high standards are not imposed by the marketplace,\nmanagement must impose its own.\nOur commitment to an above-\naverage expenditure for news represents an important quantitative\nstandard.\nWe have confidence that Stan Lipsey and Murray Light\nwill continue to apply the far-more important qualitative\nstandards.\nCharlie and I believe that newspapers are very\nspecial institutions in society.\nWe are proud of the News, and\nintend an even greater pride to be justified in the years ahead.\nInsurance Operations\nShown below is an updated version of our usual table listing\ntwo key figures for the insurance industry:\nYearly Change\nCombined Ratio\nin Premiums\nafter Policy-holder\nWritten (%)\nDividends\n-------------\n-------------------\n1972 ..............................\n10.2\n96.2\n1973 ..............................\n8.0\n99.2\n1974 ..............................\n6.2\n105.4\n1975 ..............................\n11.0\n107.9\n1976 ..............................\n21.9\n102.4\n1977 ..............................\n19.8\n97.2\n1978 ..............................\n12.8\n97.5\n1979 ..............................\n10.3\n100.6\n1980 ..............................\n6.0\n103.1\n1981 ..............................\n3.9\n106.0\n1982 ..............................\n4.4\n109.7\n1983 (Revised) ....................\n4.5\n111.9\n1984 (Estimated) ..................\n8.1\n117.7\nSource: Bests Aggregates and Averages\nBests data reflect the experience of practically the entire\nindustry, including stock, mutual, and reciprocal companies.\nThe\ncombined ratio represents total insurance costs (losses incurred\nplus expenses) compared to revenue from premiums; a ratio below\n100 indicates an underwriting profit, and one above 100 indicates\na loss.\nFor a number of years, we have told you that an annual\nincrease by the industry of about 10% per year in premiums\nwritten is necessary for the combined ratio to remain roughly\nunchanged.\nWe assumed in making that assertion that expenses as\na percentage of premium volume would stay relatively stable and\nthat losses would grow at about 10% annually because of the\ncombined influence of unit volume increases, inflation, and\njudicial rulings that expand what is covered by the insurance\npolicy.\nOur opinion is proving dismayingly accurate: a premium\nincrease of 10% per year since 1979 would have produced an\naggregate increase through 1984 of 61% and a combined ratio in\n1984 almost identical to the 100.6 of 1979.\nInstead, the\nindustry had only a 30% increase in premiums and a 1984 combined\nratio of 117.7. Today, we continue to believe that the key index\nto the trend of underwriting profitability is the year-to-year\npercentage change in industry premium volume.\nIt now appears that premium volume in 1985 will grow well\nover 10%.\nTherefore, assuming that catastrophes are at a\nnormal level, we would expect the combined ratio to begin\neasing downward toward the end of the year.\nHowever, under our\nindustrywide loss assumptions (i.e., increases of 10% annually),\nfive years of 15%-per-year increases in premiums would be\nrequired to get the combined ratio back to 100.\nThis would mean\na doubling of industry volume by 1989, an outcome that seems\nhighly unlikely to us.\nInstead, we expect several years of\npremium gains somewhat above the 10% level, followed by highly-\ncompetitive pricing that generally will produce combined ratios\nin the 108-113 range.\nOur own combined ratio in 1984 was a humbling 134. (Here, as\nthroughout this report, we exclude structured settlements and the\nassumption of loss reserves in reporting this ratio.\nMuch\nadditional detail, including the effect of discontinued\noperations on the ratio, appears on pages 42-43).\nThis is the\nthird year in a row that our underwriting performance has been\nfar poorer than that of the industry.\nWe expect an improvement\nin the combined ratio in 1985, and also expect our improvement to\nbe substantially greater than that of the industry.\nMike\nGoldberg has corrected many of the mistakes I made before he took\nover insurance operations.\nMoreover, our business is\nconcentrated in lines that have experienced poorer-than-average\nresults during the past several years, and that circumstance has\nbegun to subdue many of our competitors and even eliminate some.\nWith the competition shaken, we were able during the last half of\n1984 to raise prices significantly in certain important lines\nwith little loss of business.\nFor some years I have told you that there could be a day\ncoming when our premier financial strength would make a real\ndifference in the competitive position of our insurance\noperation.\nThat day may have arrived.\nWe are almost without\nquestion the strongest property/casualty insurance operation in\nthe country, with a capital position far superior to that of\nwell-known companies of much greater size.\nEqually important, our corporate policy is to retain that\nsuperiority.\nThe buyer of insurance receives only a promise in\nexchange for his cash.\nThe value of that promise should be\nappraised against the possibility of adversity, not prosperity.\nAt a minimum, the promise should appear able to withstand a\nprolonged combination of depressed financial markets and\nexceptionally unfavorable underwriting results.\nOur insurance\nsubsidiaries are both willing and able to keep their promises in\nany such environment - and not too many other companies clearly\nare.\nOur financial strength is a particular asset in the business\nof structured settlements and loss reserve assumptions that we\nreported on last year.\nThe claimant in a structured settlement\nand the insurance company that has reinsured loss reserves need\nto be completely confident that payments will be forthcoming for\ndecades to come.\nVery few companies in the property/casualty\nfield can meet this test of unquestioned long-term strength. (In\nfact, only a handful of companies exists with which we will\nreinsure our own liabilities.)\nWe have grown in these new lines of business: funds that we\nhold to offset assumed liabilities grew from $16.2 million to\n$30.6 million during the year.\nWe expect growth to continue and\nperhaps to greatly accelerate.\nTo support this projected growth\nwe have added substantially to the capital of Columbia Insurance\nCompany, our reinsurance unit specializing in structured\nsettlements and loss reserve assumptions.\nWhile these businesses\nare very competitive, returns should be satisfactory.\nAt GEICO the news, as usual, is mostly good.\nThat company\nachieved excellent unit growth in its primary insurance business\nduring 1984, and the performance of its investment portfolio\ncontinued to be extraordinary.\nThough underwriting results\ndeteriorated late in the year, they still remain far better than\nthose of the industry.\nOur ownership in GEICO at yearend\namounted to 36% and thus our interest in their direct\nproperty/casualty volume of $885 million amounted to $320\nmillion, or well over double our own premium volume.\nI have reported to you in the past few years that the\nperformance of GEICOs stock has considerably exceeded that\ncompanys business performance, brilliant as the latter has been.\nIn those years, the carrying value of our GEICO investment on our\nbalance sheet grew at a rate greater than the growth in GEICOs\nintrinsic business value.\nI warned you that over performance by\nthe stock relative to the performance of the business obviously\ncould not occur every year, and that in some years the stock must\nunder perform the business.\nIn 1984 that occurred and the\ncarrying value of our interest in GEICO changed hardly at all,\nwhile the intrinsic business value of that interest increased\nsubstantially.\nSince 27% of Berkshires net worth at the\nbeginning of 1984 was represented by GEICO, its static market\nvalue had a significant impact upon our rate of gain for the\nyear.\nWe are not at all unhappy with such a result: we would far\nrather have the business value of GEICO increase by X during the\nyear, while market value decreases, than have the intrinsic value\nincrease by only 1/2 X with market value soaring.\nIn GEICOs\ncase, as in all of our investments, we look to business\nperformance, not market performance.\nIf we are correct in\nexpectations regarding the business, the market eventually will\nfollow along.\nYou, as shareholders of Berkshire, have benefited in\nenormous measure from the talents of GEICOs Jack Byrne, Bill\nSnyder, and Lou Simpson.\nIn its core business - low-cost auto\nand homeowners insurance - GEICO has a major, sustainable\ncompetitive advantage.\nThat is a rare asset in business\ngenerally, and its almost non-existent in the field of financial\nservices. (GEICO, itself, illustrates this point: despite the\ncompanys excellent management, superior profitability has eluded\nGEICO in all endeavors other than its core business.) In a large\nindustry, a competitive advantage such as GEICOs provides the\npotential for unusual economic rewards, and Jack and Bill\ncontinue to exhibit great skill in realizing that potential.\nMost of the funds generated by GEICOs core insurance\noperation are made available to Lou for investment.\nLou has the\nrare combination of temperamental and intellectual\ncharacteristics that produce outstanding long-term investment\nperformance.\nOperating with below-average risk, he has generated\nreturns that have been by far the best in the insurance industry.\nI applaud and appreciate the efforts and talents of these three\noutstanding managers.\nErrors in Loss Reserving\nAny shareholder in a company with important interests in the\nproperty/casualty insurance business should have some\nunderstanding of the weaknesses inherent in the reporting of\ncurrent earnings in that industry.\nPhil Graham, when publisher\nof the Washington Post, described the daily newspaper as a first\nrough draft of history.\nUnfortunately, the financial statements\nof a property/casualty insurer provide, at best, only a first\nrough draft of earnings and financial condition.\nThe determination of costs is the main problem.\nMost of an\ninsurers costs result from losses on claims, and many of the\nlosses that should be charged against the current years revenue\nare exceptionally difficult to estimate.\nSometimes the extent of\nthese losses, or even their existence, is not known for decades.\nThe loss expense charged in a property/casualty companys\ncurrent income statement represents: (1) losses that occurred and\nwere paid during the year; (2) estimates for losses that occurred\nand were reported to the insurer during the year, but which have\nyet to be settled; (3) estimates of ultimate dollar costs for\nlosses that occurred during the year but of which the insurer is\nunaware (termed IBNR: incurred but not reported); and (4) the\nnet effect of revisions this year of similar estimates for (2)\nand (3) made in past years.\nSuch revisions may be long delayed, but eventually any\nestimate of losses that causes the income for year X to be\nmisstated must be corrected, whether it is in year X + 1, or\nX + 10.\nThis, perforce, means that earnings in the year of\ncorrection also are misstated.\nFor example, assume a claimant\nwas injured by one of our insureds in 1979 and we thought a\nsettlement was likely to be made for $10,000.\nThat year we would\nhave charged $10,000 to our earnings statement for the estimated\ncost of the loss and, correspondingly, set up a liability reserve\non the balance sheet for that amount.\nIf we settled the claim in\n1984 for $100,000, we would charge earnings with a loss cost of\n$90,000 in 1984, although that cost was truly an expense of 1979.\nAnd if that piece of business was our only activity in 1979, we\nwould have badly misled ourselves as to costs, and you as to\nearnings.\nThe necessarily-extensive use of estimates in assembling the\nfigures that appear in such deceptively precise form in the\nincome statement of property/casualty companies means that some\nerror must seep in, no matter how proper the intentions of\nmanagement.\nIn an attempt to minimize error, most insurers use\nvarious statistical techniques to adjust the thousands of\nindividual loss evaluations (called case reserves) that comprise\nthe raw data for estimation of aggregate liabilities.\nThe extra\nreserves created by these adjustments are variously labeled\nbulk, development, or supplemental reserves.\nThe goal of\nthe adjustments should be a loss-reserve total that has a 50-50\nchance of being proved either slightly too high or slightly too\nlow when all losses that occurred prior to the date of the\nfinancial statement are ultimately paid.\nAt Berkshire, we have added what we thought were appropriate\nsupplemental reserves but in recent years they have not been\nadequate.\nIt is important that you understand the magnitude of\nthe errors that have been involved in our reserving.\nYou can\nthus see for yourselves just how imprecise the process is, and\nalso judge whether we may have some systemic bias that should\nmake you wary of our current and future figures.\nThe following table shows the results from insurance\nunderwriting as we have reported them to you in recent years, and\nalso gives you calculations a year later on an if-we-knew-then-\nwhat-we think-we-know-now basis.\nI say what we think we know\nnow because the adjusted figures still include a great many\nestimates for losses that occurred in the earlier years.\nHowever, many claims from the earlier years have been settled so\nthat our one-year-later estimate contains less guess work than\nour earlier estimate:\nUnderwriting Results\nCorrected Figures\nas Reported\nAfter One Years\nYear\nto You\nExperience\n----\n--------------------\n-----------------\n1980\n$\n6,738,000\n$ 14,887,000\n1981\n1,478,000\n(1,118,000)\n1982\n(21,462,000)\n(25,066,000)\n1983\n(33,192,000)\n(50,974,000)\n1984\n(45,413,000)\n?\nOur structured settlement and loss-reserve assumption\nbusinesses are not included in this table.\nImportant\nadditional information on loss reserve experience appears\non pages 43-45.\nTo help you understand this table, here is an explanation of\nthe most recent figures: 1984s reported pre-tax underwriting\nloss of $45.4 million consists of $27.6 million we estimate that\nwe lost on 1984s business, plus the increased loss of $17.8\nmillion reflected in the corrected figure for 1983.\nAs you can see from reviewing the table, my errors in\nreporting to you have been substantial and recently have always\npresented a better underwriting picture than was truly the case.\nThis is a source of particular chagrin to me because: (1) I like\nfor you to be able to count on what I say; (2) our insurance\nmanagers and I undoubtedly acted with less urgency than we would\nhave had we understood the full extent of our losses; and (3) we\npaid income taxes calculated on overstated earnings and thereby\ngave the government money that we didnt need to.\n(These\noverpayments eventually correct themselves, but the delay is long\nand we dont receive interest on the amounts we overpaid.)\nBecause our business is weighted toward casualty and\nreinsurance lines, we have more problems in estimating loss costs\nthan companies that specialize in property insurance. (When a\nbuilding that you have insured burns down, you get a much faster\nfix on your costs than you do when an employer you have insured\nfinds out that one of his retirees has contracted a disease\nattributable to work he did decades earlier.) But I still find\nour errors embarrassing.\nIn our direct business, we have far\nunderestimated the mushrooming tendency of juries and courts to\nmake the deep pocket pay, regardless of the factual situation\nand the past precedents for establishment of liability.\nWe also\nhave underestimated the contagious effect that publicity\nregarding giant awards has on juries.\nIn the reinsurance area,\nwhere we have had our worst experience in under reserving, our\ncustomer insurance companies have made the same mistakes.\nSince\nwe set reserves based on information they supply us, their\nmistakes have become our mistakes.\nI heard a story recently that is applicable to our insurance\naccounting problems: a man was traveling abroad when he received\na call from his sister informing him that their father had died\nunexpectedly.\nIt was physically impossible for the brother to\nget back home for the funeral, but he told his sister to take\ncare of the funeral arrangements and to send the bill to him.\nAfter returning home he received a bill for several thousand\ndollars, which he promptly paid.\nThe following month another\nbill came along for $15, and he paid that too.\nAnother month\nfollowed, with a similar bill.\nWhen, in the next month, a third\nbill for $15 was presented, he called his sister to ask what was\ngoing on.\nOh, she said.\nI forgot to tell you.\nWe buried Dad\nin a rented suit.\nIf youve been in the insurance business in recent years -\nparticularly the reinsurance business - this story hurts.\nWe\nhave tried to include all of our rented suit liabilities in our\ncurrent financial statement, but our record of past error should\nmake us humble, and you suspicious.\nI will continue to report to\nyou the errors, plus or minus, that surface each year.\nNot all reserving errors in the industry have been of the\ninnocent-but-dumb variety.\nWith underwriting results as bad as\nthey have been in recent years - and with managements having as\nmuch discretion as they do in the presentation of financial\nstatements - some unattractive aspects of human nature have\nmanifested themselves.\nCompanies that would be out of business\nif they realistically appraised their loss costs have, in some\ncases, simply preferred to take an extraordinarily optimistic\nview about these yet-to-be-paid sums.\nOthers have engaged in\nvarious transactions to hide true current loss costs.\nBoth of these approaches can work for a considerable time:\nexternal auditors cannot effectively police the financial\nstatements of property/casualty insurers.\nIf liabilities of an\ninsurer, correctly stated, would exceed assets, it falls to the\ninsurer to volunteer this morbid information.\nIn other words,\nthe corpse is supposed to file the death certificate.\nUnder this\nhonor system of mortality, the corpse sometimes gives itself\nthe benefit of the doubt.\nIn most businesses, of course, insolvent companies run out\nof cash.\nInsurance is different: you can be broke but flush.\nSince cash comes in at the inception of an insurance policy and\nlosses are paid much later, insolvent insurers dont run out of\ncash until long after they have run out of net worth.\nIn fact,\nthese walking dead often redouble their efforts to write\nbusiness, accepting almost any price or risk, simply to keep the\ncash flowing in.\nWith an attitude like that of an embezzler who\nhas gambled away his purloined funds, these companies hope that\nsomehow they can get lucky on the next batch of business and\nthereby cover up earlier shortfalls.\nEven if they dont get\nlucky, the penalty to managers is usually no greater for a $100\nmillion shortfall than one of $10 million; in the meantime, while\nthe losses mount, the managers keep their jobs and perquisites.\nThe loss-reserving errors of other property/casualty\ncompanies are of more than academic interest to Berkshire.\nNot\nonly does Berkshire suffer from sell-at-any-price competition by\nthe walking dead, but we also suffer when their insolvency is\nfinally acknowledged.\nThrough various state guarantee funds that\nlevy assessments, Berkshire ends up paying a portion of the\ninsolvent insurers asset deficiencies, swollen as they usually\nare by the delayed detection that results from wrong reporting.\nThere is even some potential for cascading trouble.\nThe\ninsolvency of a few large insurers and the assessments by state\nguarantee funds that would follow could imperil weak-but-\npreviously-solvent insurers.\nSuch dangers can be mitigated if\nstate regulators become better at prompt identification and\ntermination of insolvent insurers, but progress on that front has\nbeen slow.\nWashington Public Power Supply System\nFrom October, 1983 through June, 1984 Berkshires insurance\nsubsidiaries continuously purchased large quantities of bonds of\nProjects 1, 2, and 3 of Washington Public Power Supply System\n(WPPSS).\nThis is the same entity that, on July 1, 1983,\ndefaulted on $2.2 billion of bonds issued to finance partial\nconstruction of the now-abandoned Projects 4 and 5. While there\nare material differences in the obligors, promises, and\nproperties underlying the two categories of bonds, the problems\nof Projects 4 and 5 have cast a major cloud over Projects 1, 2,\nand 3, and might possibly cause serious problems for the latter\nissues.\nIn addition, there have been a multitude of problems\nrelated directly to Projects 1, 2, and 3 that could weaken or\ndestroy an otherwise strong credit position arising from\nguarantees by Bonneville Power Administration.\nDespite these important negatives, Charlie and I judged the\nrisks at the time we purchased the bonds and at the prices\nBerkshire paid (much lower than present prices) to be\nconsiderably more than compensated for by prospects of profit.\nAs you know, we buy marketable stocks for our insurance\ncompanies based upon the criteria we would apply in the purchase\nof an entire business.\nThis business-valuation approach is not\nwidespread among professional money managers and is scorned by\nmany academics.\nNevertheless, it has served its followers well\n(to which the academics seem to say, Well, it may be all right\nin practice, but it will never work in theory.) Simply put, we\nfeel that if we can buy small pieces of businesses with\nsatisfactory underlying economics at a fraction of the per-share\nvalue of the entire business, something good is likely to happen\nto us - particularly if we own a group of such securities.\nWe extend this business-valuation approach even to bond\npurchases such as WPPSS.\nWe compare the $139 million cost of our\nyearend investment in WPPSS to a similar $139 million investment\nin an operating business.\nIn the case of WPPSS, the business\ncontractually earns $22.7 million after tax (via the interest\npaid on the bonds), and those earnings are available to us\ncurrently in cash.\nWe are unable to buy operating businesses\nwith economics close to these.\nOnly a relatively few businesses\nearn the 16.3% after tax on unleveraged capital that our WPPSS\ninvestment does and those businesses, when available for\npurchase, sell at large premiums to that capital.\nIn the average\nnegotiated business transaction, unleveraged corporate earnings\nof $22.7 million after-tax (equivalent to about $45 million pre-\ntax) might command a price of $250 - $300 million (or sometimes\nfar more).\nFor a business we understand well and strongly like,\nwe will gladly pay that much.\nBut it is double the price we paid\nto realize the same earnings from WPPSS bonds.\nHowever, in the case of WPPSS, there is what we view to be a\nvery slight risk that the business could be worth nothing\nwithin a year or two.\nThere also is the risk that interest\npayments might be interrupted for a considerable period of time.\nFurthermore, the most that the business could be worth is about\nthe $205 million face value of the bonds that we own, an amount\nonly 48% higher than the price we paid.\nThis ceiling on upside potential is an important minus.\nIt\nshould be realized, however, that the great majority of operating\nbusinesses have a limited upside potential also unless more\ncapital is continuously invested in them.\nThat is so because\nmost businesses are unable to significantly improve their average\nreturns on equity - even under inflationary conditions, though\nthese were once thought to automatically raise returns.\n(Lets push our bond-as-a-business example one notch\nfurther: if you elect to retain the annual earnings of a 12%\nbond by using the proceeds from coupons to buy more bonds,\nearnings of that bond business will grow at a rate comparable\nto that of most operating businesses that similarly reinvest all\nearnings.\nIn the first instance, a 30-year, zero-coupon, 12%\nbond purchased today for $10 million will be worth $300 million\nin 2015.\nIn the second, a $10 million business that regularly\nearns 12% on equity and retains all earnings to grow, will also\nend up with $300 million of capital in 2015.\nBoth the business\nand the bond will earn over $32 million in the final year.)\nOur approach to bond investment - treating it as an unusual\nsort of business with special advantages and disadvantages -\nmay strike you as a bit quirky.\nHowever, we believe that many\nstaggering errors by investors could have been avoided if they\nhad viewed bond investment with a businessmans perspective.\nFor\nexample, in 1946, 20-year AAA tax-exempt bonds traded at slightly\nbelow a 1% yield.\nIn effect, the buyer of those bonds at that\ntime bought a business that earned about 1% on book value\n(and that, moreover, could never earn a dime more than 1% on\nbook), and paid 100 cents on the dollar for that abominable\nbusiness.\nIf an investor had been business-minded enough to think in\nthose terms - and that was the precise reality of the bargain\nstruck - he would have laughed at the proposition and walked\naway.\nFor, at the same time, businesses with excellent future\nprospects could have been bought at, or close to, book value\nwhile earning 10%, 12%, or 15% after tax on book.\nProbably no\nbusiness in America changed hands in 1946 at book value that the\nbuyer believed lacked the ability to earn more than 1% on book.\nBut investors with bond-buying habits eagerly made economic\ncommitments throughout the year on just that basis.\nSimilar,\nalthough less extreme, conditions prevailed for the next two\ndecades as bond investors happily signed up for twenty or thirty\nyears on terms outrageously inadequate by business standards.\n(In what I think is by far the best book on investing ever\nwritten - The Intelligent Investor, by Ben Graham - the last\nsection of the last chapter begins with, Investment is most\nintelligent when it is most businesslike. This section is called\nA Final Word, and it is appropriately titled.)\nWe will emphasize again that there is unquestionably some\nrisk in the WPPSS commitment.\nIt is also the sort of risk that\nis difficult to evaluate.\nWere Charlie and I to deal with 50\nsimilar evaluations over a lifetime, we would expect our judgment\nto prove reasonably satisfactory.\nBut we do not get the chance\nto make 50 or even 5 such decisions in a single year.\nEven\nthough our long-term results may turn out fine, in any given year\nwe run a risk that we will look extraordinarily foolish. (Thats\nwhy all of these sentences say Charlie and I, or we.)\nMost managers have very little incentive to make the\nintelligent-but-with-some-chance-of-looking-like-an-idiot\ndecision.\nTheir personal gain/loss ratio is all too obvious: if\nan unconventional decision works out well, they get a pat on the\nback and, if it works out poorly, they get a pink slip. (Failing\nconventionally is the route to go; as a group, lemmings may have\na rotten image, but no individual lemming has ever received bad\npress.)\nOur equation is different.\nWith 47% of Berkshires stock,\nCharlie and I dont worry about being fired, and we receive our\nrewards as owners, not managers.\nThus we behave with Berkshires\nmoney as we would with our own.\nThat frequently leads us to\nunconventional behavior both in investments and general business\nmanagement.\nWe remain unconventional in the degree to which we\nconcentrate the investments of our insurance companies, including\nthose in WPPSS bonds.\nThis concentration makes sense only\nbecause our insurance business is conducted from a position of\nexceptional financial strength.\nFor almost all other insurers, a\ncomparable degree of concentration (or anything close to it)\nwould be totally inappropriate.\nTheir capital positions are not\nstrong enough to withstand a big error, no matter how attractive\nan investment opportunity might appear when analyzed on the basis\nof probabilities.\nWith our financial strength we can own large blocks of a few\nsecurities that we have thought hard about and bought at\nattractive prices. (Billy Rose described the problem of over-\ndiversification: If you have a harem of forty women, you never\nget to know any of them very well.) Over time our policy of\nconcentration should produce superior results, though these will\nbe tempered by our large size.\nWhen this policy produces a\nreally bad year, as it must, at least you will know that our\nmoney was committed on the same basis as yours.\nWe made the major part of our WPPSS investment at different\nprices and under somewhat different factual circumstances than\nexist at present.\nIf we decide to change our position, we will\nnot inform shareholders until long after the change has been\ncompleted. (We may be buying or selling as you read this.) The\nbuying and selling of securities is a competitive business, and\neven a modest amount of added competition on either side can cost\nus a great deal of money.\nOur WPPSS purchases illustrate this\nprinciple.\nFrom October, 1983 through June, 1984, we attempted\nto buy almost all the bonds that we could of Projects 1, 2, and\n3. Yet we purchased less than 3% of the bonds outstanding.\nHad\nwe faced even a few additional well-heeled investors, stimulated\nto buy because they knew we were, we could have ended up with a\nmaterially smaller amount of bonds, purchased at a materially\nhigher price. (A couple of coat-tail riders easily could have\ncost us $5 million.) For this reason, we will not comment about\nour activities in securities - neither to the press, nor\nshareholders, nor to anyone else - unless legally required to do\nso.\nOne final observation regarding our WPPSS purchases: we\ndislike the purchase of most long-term bonds under most\ncircumstances and have bought very few in recent years.\nThats\nbecause bonds are as sound as a dollar - and we view the long-\nterm outlook for dollars as dismal.\nWe believe substantial\ninflation lies ahead, although we have no idea what the average\nrate will turn out to be.\nFurthermore, we think there is a\nsmall, but not insignificant, chance of runaway inflation.\nSuch a possibility may seem absurd, considering the rate to\nwhich inflation has dropped.\nBut we believe that present fiscal\npolicy - featuring a huge deficit - is both extremely dangerous\nand difficult to reverse. (So far, most politicians in both\nparties have followed Charlie Browns advice: No problem is so\nbig that it cant be run away from.) Without a reversal, high\nrates of inflation may be delayed (perhaps for a long time), but\nwill not be avoided.\nIf high rates materialize, they bring with\nthem the potential for a runaway upward spiral.\nWhile there is not much to choose between bonds and stocks\n(as a class) when annual inflation is in the 5%-10% range,\nrunaway inflation is a different story.\nIn that circumstance, a\ndiversified stock portfolio would almost surely suffer an\nenormous loss in real value.\nBut bonds already outstanding would\nsuffer far more.\nThus, we think an all-bond portfolio carries a\nsmall but unacceptable wipe out risk, and we require any\npurchase of long-term bonds to clear a special hurdle.\nOnly when\nbond purchases appear decidedly superior to other business\nopportunities will we engage in them.\nThose occasions are likely\nto be few and far between.\nDividend Policy\nDividend policy is often reported to shareholders, but\nseldom explained.\nA company will say something like, Our goal\nis to pay out 40% to 50% of earnings and to increase dividends at\na rate at least equal to the rise in the CPI.\nAnd thats it -\nno analysis will be supplied as to why that particular policy is\nbest for the owners of the business.\nYet, allocation of capital\nis crucial to business and investment management.\nBecause it is,\nwe believe managers and owners should think hard about the\ncircumstances under which earnings should be retained and under\nwhich they should be distributed.\nThe first point to understand is that all earnings are not\ncreated equal.\nIn many businesses particularly those that have\nhigh asset/profit ratios - inflation causes some or all of the\nreported earnings to become ersatz.\nThe ersatz portion - lets\ncall these earnings restricted - cannot, if the business is to\nretain its economic position, be distributed as dividends.\nWere\nthese earnings to be paid out, the business would lose ground in\none or more of the following areas: its ability to maintain its\nunit volume of sales, its long-term competitive position, its\nfinancial strength.\nNo matter how conservative its payout ratio,\na company that consistently distributes restricted earnings is\ndestined for oblivion unless equity capital is otherwise infused.\nRestricted earnings are seldom valueless to owners, but they\noften must be discounted heavily.\nIn effect, they are\nconscripted by the business, no matter how poor its economic\npotential. (This retention-no-matter-how-unattractive-the-return\nsituation was communicated unwittingly in a marvelously ironic\nway by Consolidated Edison a decade ago.\nAt the time, a punitive\nregulatory policy was a major factor causing the companys stock\nto sell as low as one-fourth of book value; i.e., every time a\ndollar of earnings was retained for reinvestment in the business,\nthat dollar was transformed into only 25 cents of market value.\nBut, despite this gold-into-lead process, most earnings were\nreinvested in the business rather than paid to owners.\nMeanwhile, at construction and maintenance sites throughout New\nYork, signs proudly proclaimed the corporate slogan, Dig We\nMust.)\nRestricted earnings need not concern us further in this\ndividend discussion.\nLets turn to the much-more-valued\nunrestricted variety.\nThese earnings may, with equal\nfeasibility, be retained or distributed.\nIn our opinion,\nmanagement should choose whichever course makes greater sense for\nthe owners of the business.\nThis principle is not universally accepted.\nFor a number of\nreasons managers like to withhold unrestricted, readily\ndistributable earnings from shareholders - to expand the\ncorporate empire over which the managers rule, to operate from a\nposition of exceptional financial comfort, etc.\nBut we believe\nthere is only one valid reason for retention.\nUnrestricted\nearnings should be retained only when there is a reasonable\nprospect - backed preferably by historical evidence or, when\nappropriate, by a thoughtful analysis of the future - that for\nevery dollar retained by the corporation, at least one dollar of\nmarket value will be created for owners.\nThis will happen only\nif the capital retained produces incremental earnings equal to,\nor above, those generally available to investors.\nTo illustrate, lets assume that an investor owns a risk-\nfree 10% perpetual bond with one very unusual feature.\nEach year\nthe investor can elect either to take his 10% coupon in cash, or\nto reinvest the coupon in more 10% bonds with identical terms;\ni.e., a perpetual life and coupons offering the same cash-or-\nreinvest option.\nIf, in any given year, the prevailing interest\nrate on long-term, risk-free bonds is 5%, it would be foolish for\nthe investor to take his coupon in cash since the 10% bonds he\ncould instead choose would be worth considerably more than 100\ncents on the dollar.\nUnder these circumstances, the investor\nwanting to get his hands on cash should take his coupon in\nadditional bonds and then immediately sell them.\nBy doing that,\nhe would realize more cash than if he had taken his coupon\ndirectly in cash.\nAssuming all bonds were held by rational\ninvestors, no one would opt for cash in an era of 5% interest\nrates, not even those bondholders needing cash for living\npurposes.\nIf, however, interest rates were 15%, no rational investor\nwould want his money invested for him at 10%.\nInstead, the\ninvestor would choose to take his coupon in cash, even if his\npersonal cash needs were nil.\nThe opposite course - reinvestment\nof the coupon - would give an investor additional bonds with\nmarket value far less than the cash he could have elected.\nIf he\nshould want 10% bonds, he can simply take the cash received\nand buy them in the market, where they will be available at a\nlarge discount.\nAn analysis similar to that made by our hypothetical\nbondholder is appropriate for owners in thinking about whether a\ncompanys unrestricted earnings should be retained or paid out.\nOf course, the analysis is much more difficult and subject to\nerror because the rate earned on reinvested earnings is not a\ncontractual figure, as in our bond case, but rather a fluctuating\nfigure.\nOwners must guess as to what the rate will average over\nthe intermediate future.\nHowever, once an informed guess is\nmade, the rest of the analysis is simple: you should wish your\nearnings to be reinvested if they can be expected to earn high\nreturns, and you should wish them paid to you if low returns are\nthe likely outcome of reinvestment.\nMany corporate managers reason very much along these lines\nin determining whether subsidiaries should distribute earnings to\ntheir parent company.\nAt that level,. the managers have no\ntrouble thinking like intelligent owners.\nBut payout decisions\nat the parent company level often are a different story.\nHere\nmanagers frequently have trouble putting themselves in the shoes\nof their shareholder-owners.\nWith this schizoid approach, the CEO of a multi-divisional\ncompany will instruct Subsidiary A, whose earnings on incremental\ncapital may be expected to average 5%, to distribute all\navailable earnings in order that they may be invested in\nSubsidiary B, whose earnings on incremental capital are expected\nto be 15%.\nThe CEOs business school oath will allow no lesser\nbehavior.\nBut if his own long-term record with incremental\ncapital is 5% - and market rates are 10% - he is likely to impose\na dividend policy on shareholders of the parent company that\nmerely follows some historical or industry-wide payout pattern.\nFurthermore, he will expect managers of subsidiaries to give him\na full account as to why it makes sense for earnings to be\nretained in their operations rather than distributed to the\nparent-owner.\nBut seldom will he supply his owners with a\nsimilar analysis pertaining to the whole company.\nIn judging whether managers should retain earnings,\nshareholders should not simply compare total incremental earnings\nin recent years to total incremental capital because that\nrelationship may be distorted by what is going on in a core\nbusiness.\nDuring an inflationary period, companies with a core\nbusiness characterized by extraordinary economics can use small\namounts of incremental capital in that business at very high\nrates of return (as was discussed in last years section on\nGoodwill).\nBut, unless they are experiencing tremendous unit\ngrowth, outstanding businesses by definition generate large\namounts of excess cash.\nIf a company sinks most of this money in\nother businesses that earn low returns, the companys overall\nreturn on retained capital may nevertheless appear excellent\nbecause of the extraordinary returns being earned by the portion\nof earnings incrementally invested in the core business.\nThe\nsituation is analogous to a Pro-Am golf event: even if all of the\namateurs are hopeless duffers, the teams best-ball score will be\nrespectable because of the dominating skills of the professional.\nMany corporations that consistently show good returns both\non equity and on overall incremental capital have, indeed,\nemployed a large portion of their retained earnings on an\neconomically unattractive, even disastrous, basis.\nTheir\nmarvelous core businesses, however, whose earnings grow year\nafter year, camouflage repeated failures in capital allocation\nelsewhere (usually involving high-priced acquisitions of\nbusinesses that have inherently mediocre economics).\nThe\nmanagers at fault periodically report on the lessons they have\nlearned from the latest disappointment.\nThey then usually seek\nout future lessons. (Failure seems to go to their heads.)\nIn such cases, shareholders would be far better off if\nearnings were retained only to expand the high-return business,\nwith the balance paid in dividends or used to repurchase stock\n(an action that increases the owners interest in the exceptional\nbusiness while sparing them participation in subpar businesses).\nManagers of high-return businesses who consistently employ much\nof the cash thrown off by those businesses in other ventures with\nlow returns should be held to account for those allocation\ndecisions, regardless of how profitable the overall enterprise\nis.\nNothing in this discussion is intended to argue for\ndividends that bounce around from quarter to quarter with each\nwiggle in earnings or in investment opportunities.\nShareholders\nof public corporations understandably prefer that dividends be\nconsistent and predictable.\nPayments, therefore, should reflect\nlong-term expectations for both earnings and returns on\nincremental capital.\nSince the long-term corporate outlook\nchanges only infrequently, dividend patterns should change no\nmore often.\nBut over time distributable earnings that have been\nwithheld by managers should earn their keep.\nIf earnings have\nbeen unwisely retained, it is likely that managers, too, have\nbeen unwisely retained.\nLets now turn to Berkshire Hathaway and examine how these\ndividend principles apply to it.\nHistorically, Berkshire has\nearned well over market rates on retained earnings, thereby\ncreating over one dollar of market value for every dollar\nretained.\nUnder such circumstances, any distribution would have\nbeen contrary to the financial interest of shareholders, large or\nsmall.\nIn fact, significant distributions in the early years might\nhave been disastrous, as a review of our starting position will\nshow you.\nCharlie and I then controlled and managed three\ncompanies, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Diversified Retailing\nCompany, Inc., and Blue Chip Stamps (all now merged into our\npresent operation).\nBlue Chip paid only a small dividend,\nBerkshire and DRC paid nothing.\nIf, instead, the companies had\npaid out their entire earnings, we almost certainly would have no\nearnings at all now - and perhaps no capital as well.\nThe three\ncompanies each originally made their money from a single\nbusiness: (1) textiles at Berkshire; (2) department stores at\nDiversified; and (3) trading stamps at Blue Chip.\nThese\ncornerstone businesses (carefully chosen, it should be noted, by\nyour Chairman and Vice Chairman) have, respectively, (1) survived\nbut earned almost nothing, (2) shriveled in size while incurring\nlarge losses, and (3) shrunk in sales volume to about 5% its size\nat the time of our entry.\n(Who says you cant lose em all?)\nOnly by committing available funds to much better businesses were\nwe able to overcome these origins. (Its been like overcoming a\nmisspent youth.) Clearly, diversification has served us well.\nWe expect to continue to diversify while also supporting the\ngrowth of current operations though, as weve pointed out, our\nreturns from these efforts will surely be below our historical\nreturns.\nBut as long as prospective returns are above the rate\nrequired to produce a dollar of market value per dollar retained,\nwe will continue to retain all earnings.\nShould our estimate of\nfuture returns fall below that point, we will distribute all\nunrestricted earnings that we believe can not be effectively\nused.\nIn making that judgment, we will look at both our\nhistorical record and our prospects.\nBecause our year-to-year\nresults are inherently volatile, we believe a five-year rolling\naverage to be appropriate for judging the historical record.\nOur present plan is to use our retained earnings to further\nbuild the capital of our insurance companies.\nMost of our\ncompetitors are in weakened financial condition and reluctant to\nexpand substantially.\nYet large premium-volume gains for the\nindustry are imminent, amounting probably to well over $15\nbillion in 1985 versus less than $5 billion in 1983.\nThese\ncircumstances could produce major amounts of profitable business\nfor us.\nOf course, this result is no sure thing, but prospects\nfor it are far better than they have been for many years.\nMiscellaneous\nThis is the spot where each year I run my small business\nwanted ad.\nIn 1984 John Loomis, one of our particularly\nknowledgeable and alert shareholders, came up with a company that\nmet all of our tests.\nWe immediately pursued this idea, and only\na chance complication prevented a deal.\nSince our ad is pulling,\nwe will repeat it in precisely last years form:\nWe prefer:\n(1) large purchases (at least $5 million of after-tax\nearnings),\n(2) demonstrated consistent earning power (future\nprojections are of little interest to us, nor are\nturn-around situations),\n(3) businesses earning good returns on equity while\nemploying little or no debt,\n(4) management in place (we cant supply it),\n(5) simple businesses (if theres lots of technology, we\nwont understand it),\n(6) an offering price (we dont want to waste our time or\nthat of the seller by talking, even preliminarily,\nabout a transaction when price is unknown).\nWe will not engage in unfriendly takeovers.\nWe can promise\ncomplete confidentiality and a very fast answer - customarily\nwithin five minutes - as to whether were interested.\nWe prefer\nto buy for cash, but will consider issuance of stock when we\nreceive as much in intrinsic business value as we give.\nWe\ninvite potential sellers to check us out by contacting people\nwith whom we have done business in the past.\nFor the right\nbusiness - and the right people - we can provide a good home.\n*\n*\n*\nA record 97.2% of all eligible shares participated in\nBerkshires 1984 shareholder-designated contributions program.\nTotal contributions made through this program were $3,179,000,\nand 1,519 charities were recipients.\nOur proxy material for the\nannual meeting will allow you to cast an advisory vote expressing\nyour views about this program - whether you think we should\ncontinue it and, if so, at what per-share level. (You may be\ninterested to learn that we were unable to find a precedent for\nan advisory vote in which management seeks the opinions of\nshareholders about owner-related corporate policies.\nManagers\nwho put their trust in capitalism seem in no hurry to put their\ntrust in capitalists.)\nWe urge new shareholders to read the description of our\nshareholder-designated contributions program that appears on\npages 60 and 61.\nIf you wish to participate in future programs,\nwe strongly urge that you immediately make sure that your shares\nare registered in the name of the actual owner, not in street\nname or nominee name.\nShares not so registered on September 30,\n1985 will be ineligible for the 1985 program.\n*\n*\n*\nOur annual meeting will be on May 21, 1985 in Omaha, and I\nhope that you attend.\nMany annual meetings are a waste of time,\nboth for shareholders and for management.\nSometimes that is true\nbecause management is reluctant to open up on matters of business\nsubstance.\nMore often a nonproductive session is the fault of\nshareholder participants who are more concerned about their own\nmoment on stage than they are about the affairs of the\ncorporation.\nWhat should be a forum for business discussion\nbecomes a forum for theatrics, spleen-venting and advocacy of\nissues. (The deal is irresistible: for the price of one share you\nget to tell a captive audience your ideas as to how the world\nshould be run.) Under such circumstances, the quality of the\nmeeting often deteriorates from year to year as the antics of\nthose interested in themselves discourage attendance by those\ninterested in the business.\nBerkshires meetings are a different story.\nThe number of\nshareholders attending grows a bit each year and we have yet to\nexperience a silly question or an ego-inspired commentary.\nInstead, we get a wide variety of thoughtful questions about the\nbusiness.\nBecause the annual meeting is the time and place for\nthese, Charlie and I are happy to answer them all, no matter how\nlong it takes. (We cannot, however, respond to written or phoned\nquestions at other times of the year; one-person-at-a time\nreporting is a poor use of management time in a company with 3000\nshareholders.) The only business matters that are off limits at\nthe annual meeting are those about which candor might cost our\ncompany real money.\nOur activities in securities would be the\nmain example.\nWe always have bragged a bit on these pages about the\nquality of our shareholder-partners.\nCome to the annual meeting\nand you will see why.\nOut-of-towners should schedule a stop at\nNebraska Furniture Mart.\nIf you make some purchases, youll save\nfar more than enough to pay for your trip, and youll enjoy the\nexperience.\nWarren E. Buffett\nFebruary 25, 1985\nChairman of the Board\nSubsequent Event: On March 18, a week after copy for this\nreport went to the typographer but shortly before production, we\nagreed to purchase three million shares of Capital Cities\nCommunications, Inc. at $172.50 per share.\nOur purchase is\ncontingent upon the acquisition of American Broadcasting\nCompanies, Inc. by Capital Cities, and will close when that\ntransaction closes.\nAt the earliest, that will be very late in\n1985.\nOur admiration for the management of Capital Cities, led\nby Tom Murphy and Dan Burke, has been expressed several times in\nprevious annual reports.\nQuite simply, they are tops in both\nability and integrity.\nWe will have more to say about this\ninvestment in next years report.",

    "text": "Chairman's Letter - 1985\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nYou may remember the wildly upbeat message of last years\nreport: nothing much was in the works but our experience had been\nthat something big popped up occasionally.\nThis carefully-\ncrafted corporate strategy paid off in 1985.\nLater sections of\nthis report discuss (a) our purchase of a major position in\nCapital Cities/ABC, (b) our acquisition of Scott & Fetzer, (c)\nour entry into a large, extended term participation in the\ninsurance business of Firemans Fund, and (d) our sale of our\nstock in General Foods.\nOur gain in net worth during the year was $613.6 million, or\n48.2%. It is fitting that the visit of Halleys Comet coincided\nwith this percentage gain: neither will be seen again in my\nlifetime.\nOur gain in per-share book value over the last twenty-\none years (that is, since present management took over) has been\nfrom $19.46 to $1643.71, or 23.2% compounded annually, another\npercentage that will not be repeated.\nTwo factors make anything approaching this rate of gain\nunachievable in the future.\nOne factor probably transitory - is\na stock market that offers very little opportunity compared to\nthe markets that prevailed throughout much of the 1964-1984\nperiod.\nToday we cannot find significantly-undervalued equities\nto purchase for our insurance company portfolios.\nThe current\nsituation is 180 degrees removed from that existing about a\ndecade ago, when the only question was which bargain to choose.\nThis change in the market also has negative implications for\nour present portfolio.\nIn our 1974 annual report I could say:\nWe consider several of our major holdings to have great\npotential for significantly increased values in future years. I\ncant say that now.\nIts true that our insurance companies\ncurrently hold major positions in companies with exceptional\nunderlying economics and outstanding managements, just as they\ndid in 1974.\nBut current market prices generously appraise these\nattributes, whereas they were ignored in 1974.\nTodays\nvaluations mean that our insurance companies have no chance for\nfuture portfolio gains on the scale of those achieved in the\npast.\nThe second negative factor, far more telling, is our size.\nOur equity capital is more than twenty times what it was only ten\nyears ago.\nAnd an iron law of business is that growth eventually\ndampens exceptional economics. just look at the records of high-\nreturn companies once they have amassed even $1 billion of equity\ncapital.\nNone that I know of has managed subsequently, over a\nten-year period, to keep on earning 20% or more on equity while\nreinvesting all or substantially all of its earnings.\nInstead,\nto sustain their high returns, such companies have needed to shed\na lot of capital by way of either dividends or repurchases of\nstock.\nTheir shareholders would have been far better off if all\nearnings could have been reinvested at the fat returns earned by\nthese exceptional businesses.\nBut the companies simply couldnt\nturn up enough high-return opportunities to make that possible.\nTheir problem is our problem.\nLast year I told you that we\nneeded profits of $3.9 billion over the ten years then coming up\nto earn 15% annually.\nThe comparable figure for the ten years\nnow ahead is $5.7 billion, a 48% increase that corresponds - as\nit must mathematically - to the growth in our capital base during\n1985. (Heres a little perspective: leaving aside oil companies,\nonly about 15 U.S. businesses have managed to earn over $5.7\nbillion during the past ten years.)\nCharlie Munger, my partner in managing Berkshire, and I are\nreasonably optimistic about Berkshires ability to earn returns\nsuperior to those earned by corporate America generally, and you\nwill benefit from the companys retention of all earnings as long\nas those returns are forthcoming.\nWe have several things going\nfor us: (1) we dont have to worry about quarterly or annual\nfigures but, instead, can focus on whatever actions will maximize\nlong-term value; (2) we can expand the business into any areas\nthat make sense - our scope is not circumscribed by history,\nstructure, or concept; and (3) we love our work.\nAll of these\nhelp.\nEven so, we will also need a full measure of good fortune\nto average our hoped-for 15% - far more good fortune than was\nrequired for our past 23.2%.\nWe need to mention one further item in the investment\nequation that could affect recent purchasers of our stock.\nHistorically, Berkshire shares have sold modestly below intrinsic\nbusiness value.\nWith the price there, purchasers could be\ncertain (as long as they did not experience a widening of this\ndiscount) that their personal investment experience would at\nleast equal the financial experience of the business.\nBut\nrecently the discount has disappeared, and occasionally a modest\npremium has prevailed.\nThe elimination of the discount means that Berkshires\nmarket value increased even faster than business value (which,\nitself, grew at a pleasing pace).\nThat was good news for any\nowner holding while that move took place, but it is bad news for\nthe new or prospective owner.\nIf the financial experience of new\nowners of Berkshire is merely to match the future financial\nexperience of the company, any premium of market value over\nintrinsic business value that they pay must be maintained.\nManagement cannot determine market prices, although it can,\nby its disclosures and policies, encourage rational behavior by\nmarket participants.\nMy own preference, as perhaps youd guess,\nis for a market price that consistently approximates business\nvalue.\nGiven that relationship, all owners prosper precisely as\nthe business prospers during their period of ownership.\nWild\nswings in market prices far above and below business value do not\nchange the final gains for owners in aggregate; in the end,\ninvestor gains must equal business gains.\nBut long periods of\nsubstantial undervaluation and/or overvaluation will cause the\ngains of the business to be inequitably distributed among various\nowners, with the investment result of any given owner largely\ndepending upon how lucky, shrewd, or foolish he happens to be.\nOver the long term there has been a more consistent\nrelationship between Berkshires market value and business value\nthan has existed for any other publicly-traded equity with which\nI am familiar.\nThis is a tribute to you.\nBecause you have been\nrational, interested, and investment-oriented, the market price\nfor Berkshire stock has almost always been sensible.\nThis\nunusual result has been achieved by a shareholder group with\nunusual demographics: virtually all of our shareholders are\nindividuals, not institutions.\nNo other public company our size\ncan claim the same.\nYou might think that institutions, with their large staffs\nof highly-paid and experienced investment professionals, would be\na force for stability and reason in financial markets.\nThey are\nnot: stocks heavily owned and constantly monitored by\ninstitutions have often been among the most inappropriately\nvalued.\nBen Graham told a story 40 years ago that illustrates why\ninvestment professionals behave as they do: An oil prospector,\nmoving to his heavenly reward, was met by St. Peter with bad\nnews.\nYoure qualified for residence, said St. Peter, but, as\nyou can see, the compound reserved for oil men is packed.\nTheres no way to squeeze you in. After thinking a moment, the\nprospector asked if he might say just four words to the present\noccupants.\nThat seemed harmless to St. Peter, so the prospector\ncupped his hands and yelled, Oil discovered in hell.\nImmediately the gate to the compound opened and all of the oil\nmen marched out to head for the nether regions.\nImpressed, St.\nPeter invited the prospector to move in and make himself\ncomfortable.\nThe prospector paused.\nNo, he said, I think\nIll go along with the rest of the boys.\nThere might be some\ntruth to that rumor after all.\nSources of Reported Earnings\nThe table on the next page shows the major sources of\nBerkshires reported earnings.\nThese numbers, along with far\nmore detailed sub-segment numbers, are the ones that Charlie and\nI focus upon.\nWe do not find consolidated figures an aid in\neither managing or evaluating Berkshire and, in fact, never\nprepare them for internal use.\nSegment information is equally essential for investors\nwanting to know what is going on in a multi-line business.\nCorporate managers always have insisted upon such information\nbefore making acquisition decisions but, until a few years ago,\nseldom made it available to investors faced with acquisition and\ndisposition decisions of their own.\nInstead, when owners wishing\nto understand the economic realities of their business asked for\ndata, managers usually gave them a we-cant-tell-you-what-is-\ngoing-on-because-it-would-hurt-the-company answer.\nUltimately\nthe SEC ordered disclosure of segment data and management began\nsupplying real answers.\nThe change in their behavior recalls an\ninsight of Al Capone: You can get much further with a kind word\nand a gun than you can with a kind word alone.\nIn the table, amortization of Goodwill is not charged against the\nspecific businesses but, for reasons outlined in the Appendix to\nmy letter in the 1983 annual report, is aggregated as a separate\nitem. (A compendium of the 1977-1984 letters is available upon\nrequest.) In the Business Segment Data and Managements\nDiscussion sections on pages 39-41 and 49-55, much additional\ninformation regarding our businesses is provided, including\nGoodwill and Goodwill Amortization figures for each of the\nsegments.\nI urge you to read those sections as well as Charlie\nMungers letter to Wesco shareholders, which starts on page 56.\n(000s omitted)\n-----------------------------------------\nBerkshire's Share\nof Net Earnings\n(after taxes and\nPre-Tax Earnings\nminority interests)\n-------------------\n-------------------\n1985\n1984\n1985\n1984\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nOperating Earnings:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting ................ $(44,230)\n$(48,060)\n$(23,569)\n$(25,955)\nNet Investment Income .......\n95,217\n68,903\n79,716\n62,059\nAssociated Retail Stores ......\n270\n(1,072)\n134\n(579)\nBlue Chip Stamps ..............\n5,763\n(1,843)\n2,813\n(899)\nBuffalo News ..................\n29,921\n27,328\n14,580\n13,317\nMutual Savings and Loan .......\n2,622\n1,456\n4,016\n3,151\nNebraska Furniture Mart .......\n12,686\n14,511\n5,181\n5,917\nPrecision Steel ...............\n3,896\n4,092\n1,477\n1,696\nSees Candies .................\n28,989\n26,644\n14,558\n13,380\nTextiles ......................\n(2,395)\n418\n(1,324)\n226\nWesco Financial ...............\n9,500\n9,777\n4,191\n4,828\nAmortization of Goodwill ......\n(1,475)\n(1,434)\n(1,475)\n(1,434)\nInterest on Debt ..............\n(14,415)\n(14,734)\n(7,288)\n(7,452)\nShareholder-Designated\nContributions ..............\n(4,006)\n(3,179)\n(2,164)\n(1,716)\nOther .........................\n3,106\n4,932\n2,102\n3,475\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nOperating Earnings ..............\n125,449\n87,739\n92,948\n70,014\nSpecial General Foods Distribution\n4,127\n8,111\n3,779\n7,294\nSpecial Washington Post\nDistribution .................\n14,877\n---\n13,851\n---\nSales of Securities .............\n468,903\n104,699\n325,237\n71,587\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nTotal Earnings - all entities ... $613,356\n$200,549\n$435,815\n$148,895\n========\n========\n========\n========\nOur 1985 results include unusually large earnings from the\nsale of securities.\nThis fact, in itself, does not mean that we\nhad a particularly good year (though, of course, we did).\nSecurity profits in a given year bear similarities to a college\ngraduation ceremony in which the knowledge gained over four years\nis recognized on a day when nothing further is learned.\nWe may\nhold a stock for a decade or more, and during that period it may\ngrow quite consistently in both business and market value.\nIn\nthe year in which we finally sell it there may be no increase in\nvalue, or there may even be a decrease.\nBut all growth in value\nsince purchase will be reflected in the accounting earnings of\nthe year of sale. (If the stock owned is in our insurance\nsubsidiaries, however, any gain or loss in market value will be\nreflected in net worth annually.) Thus, reported capital gains or\nlosses in any given year are meaningless as a measure of how well\nwe have done in the current year.\nA large portion of the realized gain in 1985 ($338 million\npre-tax out of a total of $488 million) came about through the\nsale of our General Foods shares.\nWe held most of these shares\nsince 1980, when we had purchased them at a price far below what\nwe felt was their per/share business value.\nYear by year, the\nmanagerial efforts of Jim Ferguson and Phil Smith substantially\nincreased General Foods business value and, last fall, Philip\nMorris made an offer for the company that reflected the increase.\nWe thus benefited from four factors: a bargain purchase price, a\nbusiness with fine underlying economics, an able management\nconcentrating on the interests of shareholders, and a buyer\nwilling to pay full business value.\nWhile that last factor is\nthe only one that produces reported earnings, we consider\nidentification of the first three to be the key to building value\nfor Berkshire shareholders.\nIn selecting common stocks, we\ndevote our attention to attractive purchases, not to the\npossibility of attractive sales.\nWe have again reported substantial income from special\ndistributions, this year from Washington Post and General Foods.\n(The General Foods transactions obviously took place well before\nthe Philip Morris offer.) Distributions of this kind occur when\nwe sell a portion of our shares in a company back to it\nsimultaneously with its purchase of shares from other\nshareholders.\nThe number of shares we sell is contractually set\nso as to leave our percentage ownership in the company precisely\nthe same after the sale as before.\nSuch a transaction is quite\nproperly regarded by the IRS as substantially equivalent to a\ndividend since we, as a shareholder, receive cash while\nmaintaining an unchanged ownership interest.\nThis tax treatment\nbenefits us because corporate taxpayers, unlike individual\ntaxpayers, incur much lower taxes on dividend income than on\nincome from long-term capital gains. (This difference will be\nwidened further if the House-passed tax bill becomes law: under\nits provisions, capital gains realized by corporations will be\ntaxed at the same rate as ordinary income.) However, accounting\nrules are unclear as to proper treatment for shareholder\nreporting.\nTo conform with last years treatment, we have shown\nthese transactions as capital gains.\nThough we have not sought out such transactions, we have\nagreed to them on several occasions when managements initiated\nthe idea.\nIn each case we have felt that non-selling\nshareholders (all of whom had an opportunity to sell at the same\nprice we received) benefited because the companies made their\nrepurchases at prices below intrinsic business value.\nThe tax\nadvantages we receive and our wish to cooperate with managements\nthat are increasing values for all shareholders have sometimes\nled us to sell - but only to the extent that our proportional\nshare of the business was undiminished.\nAt this point we usually turn to a discussion of some of our\nmajor business units.\nBefore doing so, however, we should first\nlook at a failure at one of our smaller businesses.\nOur Vice\nChairman, Charlie Munger, has always emphasized the study of\nmistakes rather than successes, both in business and other\naspects of life.\nHe does so in the spirit of the man who said:\nAll I want to know is where Im going to die so Ill never go\nthere. Youll immediately see why we make a good team: Charlie\nlikes to study errors and I have generated ample material for\nhim, particularly in our textile and insurance businesses.\nShutdown of Textile Business\nIn July we decided to close our textile operation, and by\nyearend this unpleasant job was largely completed.\nThe history\nof this business is instructive.\nWhen Buffett Partnership, Ltd., an investment partnership of\nwhich I was general partner, bought control of Berkshire Hathaway\n21 years ago, it had an accounting net worth of $22 million, all\ndevoted to the textile business.\nThe companys intrinsic\nbusiness value, however, was considerably less because the\ntextile assets were unable to earn returns commensurate with\ntheir accounting value.\nIndeed, during the previous nine years\n(the period in which Berkshire and Hathaway operated as a merged\ncompany) aggregate sales of $530 million had produced an\naggregate loss of $10 million.\nProfits had been reported from\ntime to time but the net effect was always one step forward, two\nsteps back.\nAt the time we made our purchase, southern textile plants -\nlargely non-union - were believed to have an important\ncompetitive advantage.\nMost northern textile operations had\nclosed and many people thought we would liquidate our business as\nwell.\nWe felt, however, that the business would be run much better\nby a long-time employee whom. we immediately selected to be\npresident, Ken Chace.\nIn this respect we were 100% correct: Ken\nand his recent successor, Garry Morrison, have been excellent\nmanagers, every bit the equal of managers at our more profitable\nbusinesses.\nIn early 1967 cash generated by the textile operation was\nused to fund our entry into insurance via the purchase of\nNational Indemnity Company.\nSome of the money came from earnings\nand some from reduced investment in textile inventories,\nreceivables, and fixed assets.\nThis pullback proved wise:\nalthough much improved by Kens management, the textile business\nnever became a good earner, not even in cyclical upturns.\nFurther diversification for Berkshire followed, and\ngradually the textile operations depressing effect on our\noverall return diminished as the business became a progressively\nsmaller portion of the corporation.\nWe remained in the business\nfor reasons that I stated in the 1978 annual report (and\nsummarized at other times also): (1) our textile businesses are\nvery important employers in their communities, (2) management has\nbeen straightforward in reporting on problems and energetic in\nattacking them, (3) labor has been cooperative and understanding\nin facing our common problems, and (4) the business should\naverage modest cash returns relative to investment. I further\nsaid, As long as these conditions prevail - and we expect that\nthey will - we intend to continue to support our textile business\ndespite more attractive alternative uses for capital.\nIt turned out that I was very wrong about (4).\nThough 1979\nwas moderately profitable, the business thereafter consumed major\namounts of cash. By mid-1985 it became clear, even to me, that\nthis condition was almost sure to continue.\nCould we have found\na buyer who would continue operations, I would have certainly\npreferred to sell the business rather than liquidate it, even if\nthat meant somewhat lower proceeds for us.\nBut the economics\nthat were finally obvious to me were also obvious to others, and\ninterest was nil.\nI wont close down businesses of sub-normal profitability\nmerely to add a fraction of a point to our corporate rate of\nreturn.\nHowever, I also feel it inappropriate for even an\nexceptionally profitable company to fund an operation once it\nappears to have unending losses in prospect.\nAdam Smith would\ndisagree with my first proposition, and Karl Marx would disagree\nwith my second; the middle ground is the only position that\nleaves me comfortable.\nI should reemphasize that Ken and Garry have been\nresourceful, energetic and imaginative in attempting to make our\ntextile operation a success.\nTrying to achieve sustainable\nprofitability, they reworked product lines, machinery\nconfigurations and distribution arrangements.\nWe also made a\nmajor acquisition, Waumbec Mills, with the expectation of\nimportant synergy (a term widely used in business to explain an\nacquisition that otherwise makes no sense).\nBut in the end\nnothing worked and I should be faulted for not quitting sooner.\nA recent Business Week article stated that 250 textile mills have\nclosed since 1980.\nTheir owners were not privy to any\ninformation that was unknown to me; they simply processed it more\nobjectively.\nI ignored Comtes advice - the intellect should be\nthe servant of the heart, but not its slave - and believed what\nI preferred to believe.\nThe domestic textile industry operates in a commodity\nbusiness, competing in a world market in which substantial excess\ncapacity exists.\nMuch of the trouble we experienced was\nattributable, both directly and indirectly, to competition from\nforeign countries whose workers are paid a small fraction of the\nU.S. minimum wage.\nBut that in no way means that our labor force\ndeserves any blame for our closing.\nIn fact, in comparison with\nemployees of American industry generally, our workers were poorly\npaid, as has been the case throughout the textile business.\nIn\ncontract negotiations, union leaders and members were sensitive\nto our disadvantageous cost position and did not push for\nunrealistic wage increases or unproductive work practices.\nTo\nthe contrary, they tried just as hard as we did to keep us\ncompetitive.\nEven during our liquidation period they performed\nsuperbly. (Ironically, we would have been better off financially\nif our union had behaved unreasonably some years ago; we then\nwould have recognized the impossible future that we faced,\npromptly closed down, and avoided significant future losses.)\nOver the years, we had the option of making large capital\nexpenditures in the textile operation that would have allowed us\nto somewhat reduce variable costs.\nEach proposal to do so looked\nlike an immediate winner.\nMeasured by standard return-on-\ninvestment tests, in fact, these proposals usually promised\ngreater economic benefits than would have resulted from\ncomparable expenditures in our highly-profitable candy and\nnewspaper businesses.\nBut the promised benefits from these textile investments\nwere illusory.\nMany of our competitors, both domestic and\nforeign, were stepping up to the same kind of expenditures and,\nonce enough companies did so, their reduced costs became the\nbaseline for reduced prices industrywide.\nViewed individually,\neach companys capital investment decision appeared cost-\neffective and rational; viewed collectively, the decisions\nneutralized each other and were irrational (just as happens when\neach person watching a parade decides he can see a little better\nif he stands on tiptoes).\nAfter each round of investment, all\nthe players had more money in the game and returns remained\nanemic.\nThus, we faced a miserable choice: huge capital investment\nwould have helped to keep our textile business alive, but would\nhave left us with terrible returns on ever-growing amounts of\ncapital.\nAfter the investment, moreover, the foreign competition\nwould still have retained a major, continuing advantage in labor\ncosts.\nA refusal to invest, however, would make us increasingly\nnon-competitive, even measured against domestic textile\nmanufacturers.\nI always thought myself in the position described\nby Woody Allen in one of his movies: More than any other time in\nhistory, mankind faces a crossroads.\nOne path leads to despair\nand utter hopelessness, the other to total extinction.\nLet us\npray we have the wisdom to choose correctly.\nFor an understanding of how the to-invest-or-not-to-invest\ndilemma plays out in a commodity business, it is instructive to\nlook at Burlington Industries, by far the largest U.S. textile\ncompany both 21 years ago and now.\nIn 1964 Burlington had sales\nof $1.2 billion against our $50 million.\nIt had strengths in\nboth distribution and production that we could never hope to\nmatch and also, of course, had an earnings record far superior to\nours.\nIts stock sold at 60 at the end of 1964; ours was 13.\nBurlington made a decision to stick to the textile business,\nand in 1985 had sales of about $2.8 billion.\nDuring the 1964-85\nperiod, the company made capital expenditures of about $3\nbillion, far more than any other U.S. textile company and more\nthan $200-per-share on that $60 stock.\nA very large part of the\nexpenditures, I am sure, was devoted to cost improvement and\nexpansion.\nGiven Burlingtons basic commitment to stay in\ntextiles, I would also surmise that the companys capital\ndecisions were quite rational.\nNevertheless, Burlington has lost sales volume in real\ndollars and has far lower returns on sales and equity now than 20\nyears ago.\nSplit 2-for-1 in 1965, the stock now sells at 34 --\non an adjusted basis, just a little over its $60 price in 1964.\nMeanwhile, the CPI has more than tripled.\nTherefore, each share\ncommands about one-third the purchasing power it did at the end\nof 1964.\nRegular dividends have been paid but they, too, have\nshrunk significantly in purchasing power.\nThis devastating outcome for the shareholders indicates what\ncan happen when much brain power and energy are applied to a\nfaulty premise.\nThe situation is suggestive of Samuel Johnsons\nhorse: A horse that can count to ten is a remarkable horse - not\na remarkable mathematician. Likewise, a textile company that\nallocates capital brilliantly within its industry is a remarkable\ntextile company - but not a remarkable business.\nMy conclusion from my own experiences and from much\nobservation of other businesses is that a good managerial record\n(measured by economic returns) is far more a function of what\nbusiness boat you get into than it is of how effectively you row\n(though intelligence and effort help considerably, of course, in\nany business, good or bad).\nSome years ago I wrote: When a\nmanagement with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business\nwith a reputation for poor fundamental economics, it is the\nreputation of the business that remains intact. Nothing has\nsince changed my point of view on that matter.\nShould you find\nyourself in a chronically-leaking boat, energy devoted to\nchanging vessels is likely to be more productive than energy\ndevoted to patching leaks.\n*\n*\n*\nThere is an investment postscript in our textile saga.\nSome\ninvestors weight book value heavily in their stock-buying\ndecisions (as I, in my early years, did myself).\nAnd some\neconomists and academicians believe replacement values are of\nconsiderable importance in calculating an appropriate price level\nfor the stock market as a whole.\nThose of both persuasions would\nhave received an education at the auction we held in early 1986\nto dispose of our textile machinery.\nThe equipment sold (including some disposed of in the few\nmonths prior to the auction) took up about 750,000 square feet of\nfactory space in New Bedford and was eminently usable.\nIt\noriginally cost us about $13 million, including $2 million spent\nin 1980-84, and had a current book value of $866,000 (after\naccelerated depreciation).\nThough no sane management would have\nmade the investment, the equipment could have been replaced new\nfor perhaps $30-$50 million.\nGross proceeds from our sale of this equipment came to\n$163,122.\nAllowing for necessary pre- and post-sale costs, our\nnet was less than zero.\nRelatively modern looms that we bought\nfor $5,000 apiece in 1981 found no takers at $50.\nWe finally\nsold them for scrap at $26 each, a sum less than removal costs.\nPonder this: the economic goodwill attributable to two paper\nroutes in Buffalo - or a single Sees candy store - considerably\nexceeds the proceeds we received from this massive collection of\ntangible assets that not too many years ago, under different\ncompetitive conditions, was able to employ over 1,000 people.\nThree Very Good Businesses (and a Few Thoughts About Incentive\nCompensation)\nWhen I was 12, I lived with my grandfather for about four\nmonths.\nA grocer by trade, he was also working on a book and\neach night he dictated a few pages to me.\nThe title - brace\nyourself - was How to Run a Grocery Store and a Few Things I\nHave Learned About Fishing.\nMy grandfather was sure that\ninterest in these two subjects was universal and that the world\nawaited his views.\nYou may conclude from this sections title\nand contents that I was overexposed to Grandpas literary style\n(and personality).\nI am merging the discussion of Nebraska Furniture Mart,\nSees Candy Shops, and Buffalo Evening News here because the\neconomic strengths, weaknesses, and prospects of these businesses\nhave changed little since I reported to you a year ago.\nThe\nshortness of this discussion, however, is in no way meant to\nminimize the importance of these businesses to us: in 1985 they\nearned an aggregate of $72 million pre-tax.\nFifteen years ago,\nbefore we had acquired any of them, their aggregate earnings were\nabout $8 million pre-tax.\nWhile an increase in earnings from $8 million to $72 million\nsounds terrific - and usually is - you should not automatically\nassume that to be the case.\nYou must first make sure that\nearnings were not severely depressed in the base year.\nIf they\nwere instead substantial in relation to capital employed, an even\nmore important point must be examined: how much additional\ncapital was required to produce the additional earnings?\nIn both respects, our group of three scores well.\nFirst,\nearnings 15 years ago were excellent compared to capital then\nemployed in the businesses.\nSecond, although annual earnings are\nnow $64 million greater, the businesses require only about $40\nmillion more in invested capital to operate than was the case\nthen.\nThe dramatic growth in earning power of these three\nbusinesses, accompanied by their need for only minor amounts of\ncapital, illustrates very well the power of economic goodwill\nduring an inflationary period (a phenomenon explained in detail\nin the 1983 annual report).\nThe financial characteristics of\nthese businesses have allowed us to use a very large portion of\nthe earnings they generate elsewhere.\nCorporate America,\nhowever, has had a different experience: in order to increase\nearnings significantly, most companies have needed to increase\ncapital significantly also.\nThe average American business has\nrequired about $5 of additional capital to generate an additional\n$1 of annual pre-tax earnings.\nThat business, therefore, would\nhave required over $300 million in additional capital from its\nowners in order to achieve an earnings performance equal to our\ngroup of three.\nWhen returns on capital are ordinary, an earn-more-by-\nputting-up-more record is no great managerial achievement.\nYou\ncan get the same result personally while operating from your\nrocking chair. just quadruple the capital you commit to a savings\naccount and you will quadruple your earnings.\nYou would hardly\nexpect hosannas for that particular accomplishment.\nYet,\nretirement announcements regularly sing the praises of CEOs who\nhave, say, quadrupled earnings of their widget company during\ntheir reign - with no one examining whether this gain was\nattributable simply to many years of retained earnings and the\nworkings of compound interest.\nIf the widget company consistently earned a superior return\non capital throughout the period, or if capital employed only\ndoubled during the CEOs reign, the praise for him may be well\ndeserved.\nBut if return on capital was lackluster and capital\nemployed increased in pace with earnings, applause should be\nwithheld.\nA savings account in which interest was reinvested\nwould achieve the same year-by-year increase in earnings - and,\nat only 8% interest, would quadruple its annual earnings in 18\nyears.\nThe power of this simple math is often ignored by companies\nto the detriment of their shareholders.\nMany corporate\ncompensation plans reward managers handsomely for earnings\nincreases produced solely, or in large part, by retained earnings\n- i.e., earnings withheld from owners.\nFor example, ten-year,\nfixed-price stock options are granted routinely, often by\ncompanies whose dividends are only a small percentage of\nearnings.\nAn example will illustrate the inequities possible under\nsuch circumstances.\nLets suppose that you had a $100,000\nsavings account earning 8% interest and managed by a trustee\nwho could decide each year what portion of the interest you were\nto be paid in cash.\nInterest not paid out would be retained\nearnings added to the savings account to compound.\nAnd lets\nsuppose that your trustee, in his superior wisdom, set the pay-\nout ratio at one-quarter of the annual earnings.\nUnder these assumptions, your account would be worth\n$179,084 at the end of ten years.\nAdditionally, your annual\nearnings would have increased about 70% from $8,000 to $13,515\nunder this inspired management.\nAnd, finally, your dividends\nwould have increased commensurately, rising regularly from $2,000\nin the first year to $3,378 in the tenth year.\nEach year, when\nyour managers public relations firm prepared his annual report\nto you, all of the charts would have had lines marching skyward.\nNow, just for fun, lets push our scenario one notch further\nand give your trustee-manager a ten-year fixed-price option on\npart of your business (i.e., your savings account) based on its\nfair value in the first year.\nWith such an option, your manager\nwould reap a substantial profit at your expense - just from\nhaving held on to most of your earnings.\nIf he were both\nMachiavellian and a bit of a mathematician, your manager might\nalso have cut the pay-out ratio once he was firmly entrenched.\nThis scenario is not as farfetched as you might think.\nMany\nstock options in the corporate world have worked in exactly that\nfashion: they have gained in value simply because management\nretained earnings, not because it did well with the capital in\nits hands.\nManagers actually apply a double standard to options.\nLeaving aside warrants (which deliver the issuing corporation\nimmediate and substantial compensation), I believe it is fair to\nsay that nowhere in the business world are ten-year fixed-price\noptions on all or a portion of a business granted to outsiders.\nTen months, in fact, would be regarded as extreme.\nIt would be\nparticularly unthinkable for managers to grant a long-term option\non a business that was regularly adding to its capital.\nAny\noutsider wanting to secure such an option would be required to\npay fully for capital added during the option period.\nThe unwillingness of managers to do-unto-outsiders, however,\nis not matched by an unwillingness to do-unto-themselves.\n(Negotiating with ones self seldom produces a barroom brawl.)\nManagers regularly engineer ten-year, fixed-price options for\nthemselves and associates that, first, totally ignore the fact\nthat retained earnings automatically build value and, second,\nignore the carrying cost of capital.\nAs a result, these managers\nend up profiting much as they would have had they had an option\non that savings account that was automatically building up in\nvalue.\nOf course, stock options often go to talented, value-adding\nmanagers and sometimes deliver them rewards that are perfectly\nappropriate. (Indeed, managers who are really exceptional almost\nalways get far less than they should.) But when the result is\nequitable, it is accidental.\nOnce granted, the option is blind\nto individual performance.\nBecause it is irrevocable and\nunconditional (so long as a manager stays in the company), the\nsluggard receives rewards from his options precisely as does the\nstar.\nA managerial Rip Van Winkle, ready to doze for ten years,\ncould not wish for a better incentive system.\n(I cant resist commenting on one long-term option given an\noutsider: that granted the U.S. Government on Chrysler shares\nas partial consideration for the governments guarantee of some\nlifesaving loans.\nWhen these options worked out well for the\ngovernment, Chrysler sought to modify the payoff, arguing that\nthe rewards to the government were both far greater than intended\nand outsize in relation to its contribution to Chryslers\nrecovery.\nThe companys anguish over what it saw as an imbalance\nbetween payoff and performance made national news.\nThat anguish\nmay well be unique: to my knowledge, no managers - anywhere -\nhave been similarly offended by unwarranted payoffs arising from\noptions granted to themselves or their colleagues.)\nIronically, the rhetoric about options frequently describes\nthem as desirable because they put managers and owners in the\nsame financial boat.\nIn reality, the boats are far different.\nNo owner has ever escaped the burden of capital costs, whereas a\nholder of a fixed-price option bears no capital costs at all.\nAn\nowner must weigh upside potential against downside risk; an\noption holder has no downside.\nIn fact, the business project in\nwhich you would wish to have an option frequently is a project in\nwhich you would reject ownership. (Ill be happy to accept a\nlottery ticket as a gift - but Ill never buy one.)\nIn dividend policy also, the option holders interests are\nbest served by a policy that may ill serve the owner.\nThink back\nto the savings account example.\nThe trustee, holding his option,\nwould benefit from a no-dividend policy.\nConversely, the owner\nof the account should lean to a total payout so that he can\nprevent the option-holding manager from sharing in the accounts\nretained earnings.\nDespite their shortcomings, options can be appropriate under\nsome circumstances.\nMy criticism relates to their indiscriminate\nuse and, in that connection, I would like to emphasize three\npoints:\nFirst, stock options are inevitably tied to the overall\nperformance of a corporation.\nLogically, therefore, they should\nbe awarded only to those managers with overall responsibility.\nManagers with limited areas of responsibility should have\nincentives that pay off in relation to results under their\ncontrol.\nThe .350 hitter expects, and also deserves, a big\npayoff for his performance - even if he plays for a cellar-\ndwelling team.\nAnd the .150 hitter should get no reward - even\nif he plays for a pennant winner.\nOnly those with overall\nresponsibility for the team should have their rewards tied to its\nresults.\nSecond, options should be structured carefully.\nAbsent\nspecial factors, they should have built into them a retained-\nearnings or carrying-cost factor.\nEqually important, they should\nbe priced realistically.\nWhen managers are faced with offers for\ntheir companies, they unfailingly point out how unrealistic\nmarket prices can be as an index of real value.\nBut why, then,\nshould these same depressed prices be the valuations at which\nmanagers sell portions of their businesses to themselves? (They\nmay go further: officers and directors sometimes consult the Tax\nCode to determine the lowest prices at which they can, in effect,\nsell part of the business to insiders.\nWhile theyre at it, they\noften elect plans that produce the worst tax result for the\ncompany.) Except in highly unusual cases, owners are not well\nserved by the sale of part of their business at a bargain price -\nwhether the sale is to outsiders or to insiders.\nThe obvious\nconclusion: options should be priced at true business value.\nThird, I want to emphasize that some managers whom I admire\nenormously - and whose operating records are far better than mine\n- disagree with me regarding fixed-price options.\nThey have\nbuilt corporate cultures that work, and fixed-price options have\nbeen a tool that helped them.\nBy their leadership and example,\nand by the use of options as incentives, these managers have\ntaught their colleagues to think like owners.\nSuch a Culture is\nrare and when it exists should perhaps be left intact - despite\ninefficiencies and inequities that may infest the option program.\nIf it aint broke, dont fix it is preferable to purity at any\nprice.\nAt Berkshire, however, we use an incentive@compensation\nsystem that rewards key managers for meeting targets in their own\nbailiwicks.\nIf Sees does well, that does not produce incentive\ncompensation at the News - nor vice versa.\nNeither do we look at\nthe price of Berkshire stock when we write bonus checks.\nWe\nbelieve good unit performance should be rewarded whether\nBerkshire stock rises, falls, or stays even.\nSimilarly, we think\naverage performance should earn no special rewards even if our\nstock should soar.\nPerformance, furthermore, is defined in\ndifferent ways depending upon the underlying economics of the\nbusiness: in some our managers enjoy tailwinds not of their own\nmaking, in others they fight unavoidable headwinds.\nThe rewards that go with this system can be large.\nAt our\nvarious business units, top managers sometimes receive incentive\nbonuses of five times their base salary, or more, and it would\nappear possible that one managers bonus could top $2 million in\n1986. (I hope so.) We do not put a cap on bonuses, and the\npotential for rewards is not hierarchical.\nThe manager of a\nrelatively small unit can earn far more than the manager of a\nlarger unit if results indicate he should.\nWe believe, further,\nthat such factors as seniority and age should not affect\nincentive compensation (though they sometimes influence basic\ncompensation).\nA 20-year-old who can hit .300 is as valuable to\nus as a 40-year-old performing as well.\nObviously, all Berkshire managers can use their bonus money\n(or other funds, including borrowed money) to buy our stock in\nthe market.\nMany have done just that - and some now have large\nholdings.\nBy accepting both the risks and the carrying costs\nthat go with outright purchases, these managers truly walk in the\nshoes of owners.\nNow lets get back - at long last - to our three businesses:\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart our basic strength is an\nexceptionally low-cost operation that allows the business to\nregularly offer customers the best values available in home\nfurnishings.\nNFM is the largest store of its kind in the\ncountry.\nAlthough the already-depressed farm economy worsened\nconsiderably in 1985, the store easily set a new sales record.\nI\nalso am happy to report that NFMs Chairman, Rose Blumkin (the\nlegendary Mrs.\nB), continues at age 92 to set a pace at the\nstore that none of us can keep up with.\nShes there wheeling and\ndealing seven days a week, and I hope that any of you who visit\nOmaha will go out to the Mart and see her in action.\nIt will\ninspire you, as it does me.\nAt Sees we continue to get store volumes that are far\nbeyond those achieved by any competitor we know of.\nDespite the\nunmatched consumer acceptance we enjoy, industry trends are not\ngood, and we continue to experience slippage in poundage sales on\na same-store basis.\nThis puts pressure on per-pound costs.\nWe\nnow are willing to increase prices only modestly and, unless we\ncan stabilize per-shop poundage, profit margins will narrow.\nAt the News volume gains are also difficult to achieve.\nThough linage increased during 1985, the gain was more than\naccounted for by preprints.\nROP linage (advertising printed on\nour own pages) declined.\nPreprints are far less profitable than\nROP ads, and also more vulnerable to competition.\nIn 1985, the\nNews again controlled costs well and our household penetration\ncontinues to be exceptional.\nOne problem these three operations do not have is\nmanagement.\nAt Sees we have Chuck Huggins, the man we put in\ncharge the day we bought the business.\nSelecting him remains one\nof our best business decisions.\nAt the News we have Stan Lipsey,\na manager of equal caliber.\nStan has been with us 17 years, and\nhis unusual business talents have become more evident with every\nadditional level of responsibility he has tackled.\nAnd, at the\nMart, we have the amazing Blumkins - Mrs. B, Louie, Ron, Irv, and\nSteve - a three-generation miracle of management.\nI consider myself extraordinarily lucky to be able to work\nwith managers such as these.\nI like them personally as much as I\nadmire them professionally.\nInsurance Operations\nShown below is an updated version of our usual table,\nlisting two key figures for the insurance industry:\nYearly Change\nCombined Ratio\nin Premiums\nafter Policyholder\nWritten (%)\nDividends\n-------------\n------------------\n1972 ...............\n10.2\n96.2\n1973 ...............\n8.0\n99.2\n1974 ...............\n6.2\n105.4\n1975 ...............\n11.0\n107.9\n1976 ...............\n21.9\n102.4\n1977 ...............\n19.8\n97.2\n1978 ...............\n12.8\n97.5\n1979 ...............\n10.3\n100.6\n1980 ...............\n6.0\n103.1\n1981 ...............\n3.9\n106.0\n1982 ...............\n4.4\n109.7\n1983 ...............\n4.5\n111.9\n1984 (Revised) .....\n9.2\n117.9\n1985 (Estimated) ...\n20.9\n118.0\nSource: Bests Aggregates and Averages\nThe combined ratio represents total insurance costs (losses\nincurred plus expenses) compared to revenue from premiums: a\nratio below 100 indicates an underwriting profit, and one above\n100 indicates a loss.\nThe industrys 1985 results were highly unusual.\nThe\nrevenue gain was exceptional, and had insured losses grown at\ntheir normal rate of most recent years - that is, a few points\nabove the inflation rate - a significant drop in the combined\nratio would have occurred.\nBut losses in 1985 didnt cooperate,\nas they did not in 1984.\nThough inflation slowed considerably in\nthese years, insured losses perversely accelerated, growing by\n16% in 1984 and by an even more startling 17% in 1985.\nThe\nyears growth in losses therefore exceeds the inflation rate by\nover 13 percentage points, a modern record.\nCatastrophes were not the culprit in this explosion of loss\ncost.\nTrue, there were an unusual number of hurricanes in 1985,\nbut the aggregate damage caused by all catastrophes in 1984 and\n1985 was about 2% of premium volume, a not unusual proportion.\nNor was there any burst in the number of insured autos, houses,\nemployers, or other kinds of exposure units.\nA partial explanation for the surge in the loss figures is\nall the additions to reserves that the industry made in 1985.\nAs\nresults for the year were reported, the scene resembled a revival\nmeeting: shouting Ive sinned, Ive sinned, insurance managers\nrushed forward to confess they had under reserved in earlier\nyears.\nTheir corrections significantly affected 1985 loss\nnumbers.\nA more disturbing ingredient in the loss surge is the\nacceleration in social or judicial inflation.\nThe insurers\nability to pay has assumed overwhelming importance with juries\nand judges in the assessment of both liability and damages.\nMore\nand more, the deep pocket is being sought and found, no matter\nwhat the policy wording, the facts, or the precedents.\nThis judicial inflation represents a wild card in the\nindustrys future, and makes forecasting difficult.\nNevertheless, the short-term outlook is good.\nPremium growth\nimproved as 1985 went along (quarterly gains were an estimated\n15%, 19%, 24%, and 22%) and, barring a supercatastrophe, the\nindustrys combined ratio should fall sharply in 1986.\nThe profit improvement, however, is likely to be of short\nduration.\nTwo economic principles will see to that.\nFirst,\ncommodity businesses achieve good levels of profitability only\nwhen prices are fixed in some manner or when capacity is short.\nSecond, managers quickly add to capacity when prospects start to\nimprove and capital is available.\nIn my 1982 report to you, I discussed the commodity nature\nof the insurance industry extensively.\nThe typical policyholder\ndoes not differentiate between products but concentrates instead\non price.\nFor many decades a cartel-like procedure kept prices\nup, but this arrangement has disappeared for good.\nThe insurance\nproduct now is priced as any other commodity for which a free\nmarket exists: when capacity is tight, prices will be set\nremuneratively; otherwise, they will not be.\nCapacity currently is tight in many lines of insurance -\nthough in this industry, unlike most, capacity is an attitudinal\nconcept, not a physical fact.\nInsurance managers can write\nwhatever amount of business they feel comfortable writing,\nsubject only to pressures applied by regulators and Bests, the\nindustrys authoritative rating service.\nThe comfort level of\nboth managers and regulators is tied to capital.\nMore capital\nmeans more comfort, which in turn means more capacity.\nIn the\ntypical commodity business, furthermore, such as aluminum or\nsteel, a long gestation precedes the birth of additional\ncapacity.\nIn the insurance industry, capital can be secured\ninstantly.\nThus, any capacity shortage can be eliminated in\nshort order.\nThats exactly whats going on right now.\nIn 1985, about 15\ninsurers raised well over $3 billion, piling up capital so that\nthey can write all the business possible at the better prices now\navailable.\nThe capital-raising trend has accelerated\ndramatically so far in 1986.\nIf capacity additions continue at this rate, it wont be\nlong before serious price-cutting appears and next a fall in\nprofitability.\nWhen the fall comes, it will be the fault of the\ncapital-raisers of 1985 and 1986, not the price-cutters of 198X.\n(Critics should be understanding, however: as was the case in our\ntextile example, the dynamics of capitalism cause each insurer to\nmake decisions that for itself appear sensible, but that\ncollectively slash profitability.)\nIn past reports, I have told you that Berkshires strong\ncapital position - the best in the industry - should one day\nallow us to claim a distinct competitive advantage in the\ninsurance market.\nWith the tightening of the market, that day\narrived.\nOur premium volume more than tripled last year,\nfollowing a long period of stagnation.\nBerkshires financial\nstrength (and our record of maintaining unusual strength through\nthick and thin) is now a major asset for us in securing good\nbusiness.\nWe correctly foresaw a flight to quality by many large\nbuyers of insurance and reinsurance who belatedly recognized that\na policy is only an IOU - and who, in 1985, could not collect on\nmany of their IOUs.\nThese buyers today are attracted to\nBerkshire because of its strong capital position.\nBut, in a\ndevelopment we did not foresee, we also are finding buyers drawn\nto us because our ability to insure substantial risks sets us\napart from the crowd.\nTo understand this point, you need a few background facts\nabout large risks.\nTraditionally, many insurers have wanted to\nwrite this kind of business.\nHowever, their willingness to do so\nhas been almost always based upon reinsurance arrangements that\nallow the insurer to keep just a small portion of the risk itself\nwhile passing on (laying off) most of the risk to its\nreinsurers.\nImagine, for example, a directors and officers\n(D & O) liability policy providing $25 million of coverage.\nBy various excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts, the company\nissuing that policy might keep the liability for only the first\n$1 million of any loss that occurs.\nThe liability for any loss\nabove that amount up to $24 million would be borne by the\nreinsurers of the issuing insurer.\nIn trade parlance, a company\nthat issues large policies but retains relatively little of the\nrisk for its own account writes a large gross line but a small\nnet line.\nIn any reinsurance arrangement, a key question is how the\npremiums paid for the policy should be divided among the various\nlayers of risk.\nIn our D & O policy, for example. what part of\nthe premium received should be kept by the issuing company to\ncompensate it fairly for taking the first $1 million of risk and\nhow much should be passed on to the reinsurers to compensate them\nfairly for taking the risk between $1 million and $25 million?\nOne way to solve this problem might be deemed the Patrick\nHenry approach: I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided,\nand that is the lamp of experience. In other words, how much of\nthe total premium would reinsurers have needed in the past to\ncompensate them fairly for the losses they actually had to bear?\nUnfortunately, the lamp of experience has always provided\nimperfect illumination for reinsurers because so much of their\nbusiness is long-tail, meaning it takes many years before they\nknow what their losses are.\nLately, however, the light has not\nonly been dim but also grossly misleading in the images it has\nrevealed.\nThat is, the courts tendency to grant awards that are\nboth huge and lacking in precedent makes reinsurers usual\nextrapolations or inferences from past data a formula for\ndisaster.\nOut with Patrick Henry and in with Pogo: The future\naint what it used to be.\nThe burgeoning uncertainties of the business, coupled with\nthe entry into reinsurance of many unsophisticated participants,\nworked in recent years in favor of issuing companies writing a\nsmall net line: they were able to keep a far greater percentage\nof the premiums than the risk.\nBy doing so, the issuing\ncompanies sometimes made money on business that was distinctly\nunprofitable for the issuing and reinsuring companies combined.\n(This result was not necessarily by intent: issuing companies\ngenerally knew no more than reinsurers did about the ultimate\ncosts that would be experienced at higher layers of risk.)\nInequities of this sort have been particularly pronounced in\nlines of insurance in which much change was occurring and losses\nwere soaring; e.g., professional malpractice, D & 0, products\nliability, etc.\nGiven these circumstances, it is not surprising\nthat issuing companies remained enthusiastic about writing\nbusiness long after premiums became woefully inadequate on a\ngross basis.\nAn example of just how disparate results have been for\nissuing companies versus their reinsurers is provided by the 1984\nfinancials of one of the leaders in large and unusual risks.\nIn\nthat year the company wrote about $6 billion of business and kept\naround $2 1/2 billion of the premiums, or about 40%.\nIt gave the\nremaining $3 1/2 billion to reinsurers.\nOn the part of the\nbusiness kept, the companys underwriting loss was less than $200\nmillion - an excellent result in that year.\nMeanwhile, the part\nlaid off produced a loss of over $1.5 billion for the reinsurers.\nThus, the issuing company wrote at a combined ratio of well under\n110 while its reinsurers, participating in precisely the same\npolicies, came in considerably over 140.\nThis result was not\nattributable to natural catastrophes; it came from run-of-the-\nmill insurance losses (occurring, however, in surprising\nfrequency and size).\nThe issuing companys 1985 report is not\nyet available, but I would predict it will show that dramatically\nunbalanced results continued.\nA few years such as this, and even slow-witted reinsurers\ncan lose interest, particularly in explosive lines where the\nproper split in premium between issuer and reinsurer remains\nimpossible to even roughly estimate.\nThe behavior of reinsurers\nfinally becomes like that of Mark Twains cat: having once sat on\na hot stove, it never did so again - but it never again sat on a\ncold stove, either.\nReinsurers have had so many unpleasant\nsurprises in long-tail casualty lines that many have decided\n(probably correctly) to give up the game entirely, regardless of\nprice inducements.\nConsequently, there has been a dramatic pull-\nback of reinsurance capacity in certain important lines.\nThis development has left many issuing companies under\npressure.\nThey can no longer commit their reinsurers, time after\ntime, for tens of millions per policy as they so easily could do\nonly a year or two ago, and they do not have the capital and/or\nappetite to take on large risks for their own account.\nFor many\nissuing companies, gross capacity has shrunk much closer to net\ncapacity - and that is often small, indeed.\nAt Berkshire we have never played the lay-it-off-at-a-profit\ngame and, until recently, that put us at a severe disadvantage in\ncertain lines.\nNow the tables are turned: we have the\nunderwriting capability whereas others do not.\nIf we believe the\nprice to be right, we are willing to write a net line larger than\nthat of any but the largest insurers.\nFor instance, we are\nperfectly willing to risk losing $10 million of our own money on\na single event, as long as we believe that the price is right and\nthat the risk of loss is not significantly correlated with other\nrisks we are insuring.\nVery few insurers are willing to risk\nhalf that much on single events - although, just a short while\nago, many were willing to lose five or ten times that amount as\nlong as virtually all of the loss was for the account of their\nreinsurers.\nIn mid-1985 our largest insurance company, National\nIndemnity Company, broadcast its willingness to underwrite large\nrisks by running an ad in three issues of an insurance weekly.\nThe ad solicited policies of only large size: those with a\nminimum premium of $1 million.\nThis ad drew a remarkable 600\nreplies and ultimately produced premiums totaling about $50\nmillion. (Hold the applause: its all long-tail business and it\nwill be at least five years before we know whether this marketing\nsuccess was also an underwriting success.) Today, our insurance\nsubsidiaries continue to be sought out by brokers searching for\nlarge net capacity.\nAs I have said, this period of tightness will pass; insurers\nand reinsurers will return to underpricing.\nBut for a year or\ntwo we should do well in several segments of our insurance\nbusiness.\nMike Goldberg has made many important improvements in\nthe operation (prior mismanagement by your Chairman having\nprovided him ample opportunity to do so).\nHe has been\nparticularly successful recently in hiring young managers with\nexcellent potential.\nThey will have a chance to show their stuff\nin 1986.\nOur combined ratio has improved - from 134 in 1984 to 111 in\n1985 - but continues to reflect past misdeeds.\nLast year I told\nyou of the major mistakes I had made in loss-reserving, and\npromised I would update you annually on loss-development figures.\nNaturally, I made this promise thinking my future record would be\nmuch improved.\nSo far this has not been the case.\nDetails on\nlast years loss development are on pages 50-52.\nThey reveal\nsignificant underreserving at the end of 1984, as they did in the\nseveral years preceding.\nThe only bright spot in this picture is that virtually all\nof the underreserving revealed in 1984 occurred in the\nreinsurance area - and there, in very large part, in a few\ncontracts that were discontinued several years ago.\nThis\nexplanation, however, recalls all too well a story told me many\nyears ago by the then Chairman of General Reinsurance Company.\nHe said that every year his managers told him that except for\nthe Florida hurricane or except for Midwestern tornadoes, they\nwould have had a terrific year.\nFinally he called the group\ntogether and suggested that they form a new operation - the\nExcept-For Insurance Company - in which they would henceforth\nplace all of the business that they later wouldnt want to count.\nIn any business, insurance or otherwise, except for should\nbe excised from the lexicon.\nIf you are going to play the game,\nyou must count the runs scored against you in all nine innings.\nAny manager who consistently says except for and then reports\non the lessons he has learned from his mistakes may be missing\nthe only important lesson - namely, that the real mistake is not\nthe act, but the actor.\nInevitably, of course, business errors will occur and the\nwise manager will try to find the proper lessons in them.\nBut\nthe trick is to learn most lessons from the experiences of\nothers.\nManagers who have learned much from personal experience\nin the past usually are destined to learn much from personal\nexperience in the future.\nGEICO, 38%-owned by Berkshire, reported an excellent year in\n1985 in premium growth and investment results, but a poor year -\nby its lofty standards - in underwriting.\nPrivate passenger auto\nand homeowners insurance were the only important lines in the\nindustry whose results deteriorated significantly during the\nyear.\nGEICO did not escape the trend, although its record was\nfar better than that of virtually all its major competitors.\nJack Byrne left GEICO at mid-year to head Firemans Fund,\nleaving behind Bill Snyder as Chairman and Lou Simpson as Vice\nChairman.\nJacks performance in reviving GEICO from near-\nbankruptcy was truly extraordinary, and his work resulted in\nenormous gains for Berkshire.\nWe owe him a great deal for that.\nWe are equally indebted to Jack for an achievement that\neludes most outstanding leaders: he found managers to succeed him\nwho have talents as valuable as his own.\nBy his skill in\nidentifying, attracting and developing Bill and Lou, Jack\nextended the benefits of his managerial stewardship well beyond\nhis tenure.\nFiremans Fund Quota-Share Contract\nNever one to let go of a meal ticket, we have followed Jack\nByrne to Firemans Fund (FFIC) where he is Chairman and CEO of\nthe holding company.\nOn September 1, 1985 we became a 7% participant in all of\nthe business in force of the FFIC group, with the exception of\nreinsurance they write for unaffiliated companies.\nOur contract\nruns for four years, and provides that our losses and costs will\nbe proportionate to theirs throughout the contract period.\nIf\nthere is no extension, we will thereafter have no participation\nin any ongoing business.\nHowever, for a great many years in the\nfuture, we will be reimbursing FFIC for our 7% of the losses that\noccurred in the September 1, 1985 - August 31, 1989 period.\nUnder the contract FFIC remits premiums to us promptly and\nwe reimburse FFIC promptly for expenses and losses it has paid.\nThus, funds generated by our share of the business are held by us\nfor investment.\nAs part of the deal, Im available to FFIC for\nconsultation about general investment strategy.\nIm not\ninvolved, however, in specific investment decisions of FFIC, nor\nis Berkshire involved in any aspect of the companys underwriting\nactivities.\nCurrently FFIC is doing about $3 billion of business, and it\nwill probably do more as rates rise.\nThe companys September 1,\n1985 unearned premium reserve was $1.324 billion, and it\ntherefore transferred 7% of this, or $92.7 million, to us at\ninitiation of the contract.\nWe concurrently paid them $29.4\nmillion representing the underwriting expenses that they had\nincurred on the transferred premium.\nAll of the FFIC business is\nwritten by National Indemnity Company, but two-sevenths of it is\npassed along to Wesco-Financial Insurance Company (Wes-FIC), a\nnew company organized by our 80%-owned subsidiary, Wesco\nFinancial Corporation.\nCharlie Munger has some interesting\ncomments about Wes-FIC and the reinsurance business on pages 60-\n62.\nTo the Insurance Segment tables on page 41, we have added a\nnew line, labeled Major Quota Share Contracts.\nThe 1985 results\nof the FFIC contract are reported there, though the newness of\nthe arrangement makes these results only very rough\napproximations.\nAfter the end of the year, we secured another quota-share\ncontract, whose 1986 volume should be over $50 million.\nWe hope\nto develop more of this business, and industry conditions suggest\nthat we could: a significant number of companies are generating\nmore business than they themselves can prudently handle.\nOur\nfinancial strength makes us an attractive partner for such\ncompanies.\nMarketable Securities\nWe show below our 1985 yearend net holdings in marketable\nequities.\nAll positions with a market value over $25 million are\nlisted, and the interests attributable to minority shareholders\nof Wesco and Nebraska Furniture Mart are excluded.\nNo. of Shares\nCost\nMarket\n-------------\n----------\n----------\n(000s omitted)\n1,036,461\nAffiliated Publications, Inc. .......\n$ 3,516\n$\n55,710\n900,800\nAmerican Broadcasting Companies, Inc.\n54,435\n108,997\n2,350,922\nBeatrice Companies, Inc. ............\n106,811\n108,142\n6,850,000\nGEICO Corporation ...................\n45,713\n595,950\n2,379,200\nHandy & Harman ......................\n27,318\n43,718\n847,788\nTime, Inc. ..........................\n20,385\n52,669\n1,727,765\nThe Washington Post Company .........\n9,731\n205,172\n----------\n----------\n267,909\n1,170,358\nAll Other Common Stockholdings ......\n7,201\n27,963\n----------\n----------\nTotal Common Stocks\n$275,110\n$1,198,321\n==========\n==========\nWe mentioned earlier that in the past decade the investment\nenvironment has changed from one in which great businesses were\ntotally unappreciated to one in which they are appropriately\nrecognized.\nThe Washington Post Company (WPC) provides an\nexcellent example.\nWe bought all of our WPC holdings in mid-1973 at a price of\nnot more than one-fourth of the then per-share business value of\nthe enterprise.\nCalculating the price/value ratio required no\nunusual insights.\nMost security analysts, media brokers, and\nmedia executives would have estimated WPCs intrinsic business\nvalue at $400 to $500 million just as we did.\nAnd its $100\nmillion stock market valuation was published daily for all to\nsee.\nOur advantage, rather, was attitude: we had learned from\nBen Graham that the key to successful investing was the purchase\nof shares in good businesses when market prices were at a large\ndiscount from underlying business values.\nMost institutional investors in the early 1970s, on the\nother hand, regarded business value as of only minor relevance\nwhen they were deciding the prices at which they would buy or\nsell.\nThis now seems hard to believe.\nHowever, these\ninstitutions were then under the spell of academics at\nprestigious business schools who were preaching a newly-fashioned\ntheory: the stock market was totally efficient, and therefore\ncalculations of business value - and even thought, itself - were\nof no importance in investment activities. (We are enormously\nindebted to those academics: what could be more advantageous in\nan intellectual contest - whether it be bridge, chess, or stock\nselection than to have opponents who have been taught that\nthinking is a waste of energy?)\nThrough 1973 and 1974, WPC continued to do fine as a\nbusiness, and intrinsic value grew.\nNevertheless, by yearend\n1974 our WPC holding showed a loss of about 25%, with market\nvalue at $8 million against our cost of $10.6 million.\nWhat we\nhad thought ridiculously cheap a year earlier had become a good\nbit cheaper as the market, in its infinite wisdom, marked WPC\nstock down to well below 20 cents on the dollar of intrinsic\nvalue.\nYou know the happy outcome.\nKay Graham, CEO of WPC, had the\nbrains and courage to repurchase large quantities of stock for\nthe company at those bargain prices, as well as the managerial\nskills necessary to dramatically increase business values.\nMeanwhile, investors began to recognize the exceptional economics\nof the business and the stock price moved closer to underlying\nvalue.\nThus, we experienced a triple dip: the companys business\nvalue soared upward, per-share business value increased\nconsiderably faster because of stock repurchases and, with a\nnarrowing of the discount, the stock price outpaced the gain in\nper-share business value.\nWe hold all of the WPC shares we bought in 1973, except for\nthose sold back to the company in 1985s proportionate\nredemption.\nProceeds from the redemption plus yearend market\nvalue of our holdings total $221 million.\nIf we had invested our $10.6 million in any of a half-dozen\nmedia companies that were investment favorites in mid-1973, the\nvalue of our holdings at yearend would have been in the area of\n$40 - $60 million.\nOur gain would have far exceeded the gain in\nthe general market, an outcome reflecting the exceptional\neconomics of the media business.\nThe extra $160 million or so we\ngained through ownership of WPC came, in very large part, from\nthe superior nature of the managerial decisions made by Kay as\ncompared to those made by managers of most media companies.\nHer\nstunning business success has in large part gone unreported but\namong Berkshire shareholders it should not go unappreciated.\nOur Capital Cities purchase, described in the next section,\nrequired me to leave the WPC Board early in 1986.\nBut we intend\nto hold indefinitely whatever WPC stock FCC rules allow us to.\nWe expect WPCs business values to grow at a reasonable rate, and\nwe know that management is both able and shareholder-oriented.\nHowever, the market now values the company at over $1.8 billion,\nand there is no way that the value can progress from that level\nat a rate anywhere close to the rate possible when the companys\nvaluation was only $100 million.\nBecause market prices have also\nbeen bid up for our other holdings, we face the same vastly-\nreduced potential throughout our portfolio.\nYou will notice that we had a significant holding in\nBeatrice Companies at yearend.\nThis is a short-term arbitrage\nholding - in effect, a parking place for money (though not a\ntotally safe one, since deals sometimes fall through and create\nsubstantial losses).\nWe sometimes enter the arbitrage field when\nwe have more money than ideas, but only to participate in\nannounced mergers and sales.\nWe would be a lot happier if the\nfunds currently employed on this short-term basis found a long-\nterm home.\nAt the moment, however, prospects are bleak.\nAt yearend our insurance subsidiaries had about $400 million\nin tax-exempt bonds, of which $194 million at amortized cost were\nissues of Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS)\nProjects 1, 2, and 3. 1 discussed this position fully last year,\nand explained why we would not disclose further purchases or\nsales until well after the fact (adhering to the policy we follow\non stocks).\nOur unrealized gain on the WPPSS bonds at yearend\nwas $62 million, perhaps one-third arising from the upward\nmovement of bonds generally, and the remainder from a more\npositive investor view toward WPPSS 1, 2, and 3s.\nAnnual tax-\nexempt income from our WPPSS issues is about $30 million.\nCapital Cities/ABC, Inc.\nRight after yearend, Berkshire purchased 3 million shares of\nCapital Cities/ABC, Inc. (Cap Cities) at $172.50 per share, the\nmarket price of such shares at the time the commitment was made\nearly in March, 1985.\nIve been on record for many years about\nthe management of Cap Cities: I think it is the best of any\npublicly-owned company in the country.\nAnd Tom Murphy and Dan\nBurke are not only great managers, they are precisely the sort of\nfellows that you would want your daughter to marry.\nIt is a\nprivilege to be associated with them - and also a lot of fun, as\nany of you who know them will understand.\nOur purchase of stock helped Cap Cities finance the $3.5\nbillion acquisition of American Broadcasting Companies.\nFor Cap\nCities, ABC is a major undertaking whose economics are likely to\nbe unexciting over the next few years.\nThis bothers us not an\niota; we can be very patient. (No matter how great the talent or\neffort, some things just take time: you cant produce a baby in\none month by getting nine women pregnant.)\nAs evidence of our confidence, we have executed an unusual\nagreement: for an extended period Tom, as CEO (or Dan, should he\nbe CEO) votes our stock.\nThis arrangement was initiated by\nCharlie and me, not by Tom.\nWe also have restricted ourselves in\nvarious ways regarding sale of our shares.\nThe object of these\nrestrictions is to make sure that our block does not get sold to\nanyone who is a large holder (or intends to become a large\nholder) without the approval of management, an arrangement\nsimilar to ones we initiated some years ago at GEICO and\nWashington Post.\nSince large blocks frequently command premium prices, some\nmight think we have injured Berkshire financially by creating\nsuch restrictions.\nOur view is just the opposite.\nWe feel the\nlong-term economic prospects for these businesses - and, thus,\nfor ourselves as owners - are enhanced by the arrangements.\nWith\nthem in place, the first-class managers with whom we have aligned\nourselves can focus their efforts entirely upon running the\nbusinesses and maximizing long-term values for owners.\nCertainly\nthis is much better than having those managers distracted by\nrevolving-door capitalists hoping to put the company in play.\n(Of course, some managers place their own interests above those\nof the company and its owners and deserve to be shaken up - but,\nin making investments, we try to steer clear of this type.)\nToday, corporate instability is an inevitable consequence of\nwidely-diffused ownership of voting stock.\nAt any time a major\nholder can surface, usually mouthing reassuring rhetoric but\nfrequently harboring uncivil intentions.\nBy circumscribing our\nblocks of stock as we often do, we intend to promote stability\nwhere it otherwise might be lacking.\nThat kind of certainty,\ncombined with a good manager and a good business, provides\nexcellent soil for a rich financial harvest.\nThats the economic\ncase for our arrangements.\nThe human side is just as important.\nWe dont want managers\nwe like and admire - and who have welcomed a major financial\ncommitment by us - to ever lose any sleep wondering whether\nsurprises might occur because of our large ownership.\nI have\ntold them there will be no surprises, and these agreements put\nBerkshires signature where my mouth is.\nThat signature also\nmeans the managers have a corporate commitment and therefore need\nnot worry if my personal participation in Berkshires affairs\nends prematurely (a term I define as any age short of three\ndigits).\nOur Cap Cities purchase was made at a full price, reflecting\nthe very considerable enthusiasm for both media stocks and media\nproperties that has developed in recent years (and that, in the\ncase of some property purchases, has approached a mania). its no\nfield for bargains.\nHowever, our Cap Cities investment allies us\nwith an exceptional combination of properties and people - and we\nlike the opportunity to participate in size.\nOf course, some of you probably wonder why we are now buying\nCap Cities at $172.50 per share given that your Chairman, in a\ncharacteristic burst of brilliance, sold Berkshires holdings in\nthe same company at $43 per share in 1978-80.\nAnticipating your\nquestion, I spent much of 1985 working on a snappy answer that\nwould reconcile these acts.\nA little more time, please.\nAcquisition of Scott & Fetzer\nRight after yearend we acquired The Scott & Fetzer Company\n(Scott Fetzer) of Cleveland for about $320 million. (In\naddition, about $90 million of pre-existing Scott Fetzer debt\nremains in place.) In the next section of this report I describe\nthe sort of businesses that we wish to buy for Berkshire.\nScott\nFetzer is a prototype - understandable, large, well-managed, a\ngood earner.\nThe company has sales of about $700 million derived from 17\nbusinesses, many leaders in their fields.\nReturn on invested\ncapital is good to excellent for most of these businesses.\nSome\nwell-known products are Kirby home-care systems, Campbell\nHausfeld air compressors, and Wayne burners and water pumps.\nWorld Book, Inc. - accounting for about 40% of Scott\nFetzers sales and a bit more of its income - is by far the\ncompanys largest operation.\nIt also is by far the leader in its\nindustry, selling more than twice as many encyclopedia sets\nannually as its nearest competitor.\nIn fact, it sells more sets\nin the U.S. than its four biggest competitors combined.\nCharlie and I have a particular interest in the World Book\noperation because we regard its encyclopedia as something\nspecial.\nIve been a fan (and user) for 25 years, and now have\ngrandchildren consulting the sets just as my children did.\nWorld\nBook is regularly rated the most useful encyclopedia by teachers,\nlibrarians and consumer buying guides.\nYet it sells for less\nthan any of its major competitors. Childcraft, another World\nBook, Inc. product, offers similar value.\nThis combination of\nexceptional products and modest prices at World Book, Inc. helped\nmake us willing to pay the price demanded for Scott Fetzer,\ndespite declining results for many companies in the direct-\nselling industry.\nAn equal attraction at Scott Fetzer is Ralph Schey, its CEO\nfor nine years.\nWhen Ralph took charge, the company had 31\nbusinesses, the result of an acquisition spree in the 1960s.\nHe\ndisposed of many that did not fit or had limited profit\npotential, but his focus on rationalizing the original potpourri\nwas not so intense that he passed by World Book when it became\navailable for purchase in 1978.\nRalphs operating and capital-\nallocation record is superb, and we are delighted to be\nassociated with him.\nThe history of the Scott Fetzer acquisition is interesting,\nmarked by some zigs and zags before we became involved.\nThe\ncompany had been an announced candidate for purchase since early\n1984.\nA major investment banking firm spent many months\ncanvassing scores of prospects, evoking interest from several.\nFinally, in mid-1985 a plan of sale, featuring heavy\nparticipation by an ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plan), was\napproved by shareholders.\nHowever, as difficulty in closing\nfollowed, the plan was scuttled.\nI had followed this corporate odyssey through the\nnewspapers.\nOn October 10, well after the ESOP deal had fallen\nthrough, I wrote a short letter to Ralph, whom I did not know.\nI\nsaid we admired the companys record and asked if he might like\nto talk.\nCharlie and I met Ralph for dinner in Chicago on\nOctober 22 and signed an acquisition contract the following week.\nThe Scott Fetzer acquisition, plus major growth in our\ninsurance business, should push revenues above $2 billion in\n1986, more than double those of 1985.\nMiscellaneous\nThe Scott Fetzer purchase illustrates our somewhat haphazard\napproach to acquisitions.\nWe have no master strategy, no\ncorporate planners delivering us insights about socioeconomic\ntrends, and no staff to investigate a multitude of ideas\npresented by promoters and intermediaries.\nInstead, we simply\nhope that something sensible comes along - and, when it does, we\nact.\nTo give fate a helping hand, we again repeat our regular\nbusiness wanted ad.\nThe only change from last years copy is\nin (1): because we continue to want any acquisition we make to\nhave a measurable impact on Berkshires financial results, we\nhave raised our minimum profit requirement.\nHeres what were looking for:\n(1) large purchases (at least $10 million of after-tax\nearnings),\n(2) demonstrated consistent earning power (future\nprojections are of little interest to us, nor are\nturn-around situations),\n(3) businesses earning good returns on equity while\nemploying little or no debt,\n(4) management in place (we cant supply it),\n(5) simple businesses (if theres lots of technology, we\nwont understand it),\n(6) an offering price (we dont want to waste our time\nor that of the seller by talking, even preliminarily,\nabout a transaction when price is unknown).\nWe will not engage in unfriendly takeovers.\nWe can promise\ncomplete confidentiality and a very fast answer - customarily\nwithin five minutes - as to whether were interested.\nWe prefer\nto buy for cash, but will consider issuance of stock when we\nreceive as much in intrinsic business value as we give.\nIndeed,\nfollowing recent advances in the price of Berkshire stock,\ntransactions involving stock issuance may be quite feasible.\nWe\ninvite potential sellers to check us out by contacting people\nwith whom we have done business in the past.\nFor the right\nbusiness - and the right people - we can provide a good home.\nOn the other hand, we frequently get approached about\nacquisitions that dont come close to meeting our tests: new\nventures, turnarounds, auction-like sales, and the ever-popular\n(among brokers) Im-sure-something-will-work-out-if-you-people-\nget-to-know-each-other.\nNone of these attracts us in the least.\n*\n*\n*\nBesides being interested in the purchases of entire\nbusinesses as described above, we are also interested in the\nnegotiated purchase of large, but not controlling, blocks of\nstock, as in our Cap Cities purchase.\nSuch purchases appeal to\nus only when we are very comfortable with both the economics of\nthe business and the ability and integrity of the people running\nthe operation.\nWe prefer large transactions: in the unusual case\nwe might do something as small as $50 million (or even smaller),\nbut our preference is for commitments many times that size.\n*\n*\n*\nAbout 96.8% of all eligible shares participated in\nBerkshires 1985 shareholder-designated contributions program.\nTotal contributions made through the program were $4 million, and\n1,724 charities were recipients.\nWe conducted a plebiscite last\nyear in order to get your views about this program, as well as\nabout our dividend policy.\n(Recognizing that its possible to\ninfluence the answers to a question by the framing of it, we\nattempted to make the wording of ours as neutral as possible.) We\npresent the ballot and the results in the Appendix on page 69. I\nthink its fair to summarize your response as highly supportive\nof present policies and your group preference - allowing for the\ntendency of people to vote for the status quo - to be for\nincreasing the annual charitable commitment as our asset values\nbuild.\nWe urge new shareholders to read the description of our\nshareholder-designated contributions program that appears on\npages 66 and 67.\nIf you wish to participate in future programs,\nwe strongly urge that you immediately make sure that your shares\nare registered in the name of the actual owner, not in street\nname or nominee name.\nShares not so registered on September 30,\n1986 will be ineligible for the 1986 program.\n*\n*\n*\nFive years ago we were required by the Bank Holding Company\nAct of 1969 to dispose of our holdings in The Illinois National\nBank and Trust Company of Rockford, Illinois.\nOur method of\ndoing so was unusual: we announced an exchange ratio between\nstock of Rockford Bancorp Inc. (the Illinois Nationals holding\ncompany) and stock of Berkshire, and then let each of our\nshareholders - except me - make the decision as to whether to\nexchange all, part, or none of his Berkshire shares for Rockford\nshares.\nI took the Rockford stock that was left over and thus my\nown holding in Rockford was determined by your decisions.\nAt the\ntime I said, This technique embodies the worlds oldest and most\nelementary system of fairly dividing an object.\nJust as when you\nwere a child and one person cut the cake and the other got first\nchoice, I have tried to cut the company fairly, but you get first\nchoice as to which piece you want.\nLast fall Illinois National was sold.\nWhen Rockfords\nliquidation is completed, its shareholders will have received\nper-share proceeds about equal to Berkshires per-share intrinsic\nvalue at the time of the banks sale.\nIm pleased that this\nfive-year result indicates that the division of the cake was\nreasonably equitable.\nLast year I put in a plug for our annual meeting, and you\ntook me up on the invitation.\nOver 250 of our more than 3,000\nregistered shareholders showed up.\nThose attending behaved just\nas those present in previous years, asking the sort of questions\nyou would expect from intelligent and interested owners.\nYou can\nattend a great many annual meetings without running into a crowd\nlike ours. (Lester Maddox, when Governor of Georgia, was\ncriticized regarding the states abysmal prison system.\nThe\nsolution, he said, is simple.\nAll we need is a better class of\nprisoners. Upgrading annual meetings works the same way.)\nI hope you come to this years meeting, which will be held\non May 20 in Omaha.\nThere will be only one change: after 48\nyears of allegiance to another soft drink, your Chairman, in an\nunprecedented display of behavioral flexibility, has converted to\nthe new Cherry Coke.\nHenceforth, it will be the Official Drink\nof the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting.\nAnd bring money: Mrs. B promises to have bargains galore if\nyou will pay her a visit at The Nebraska Furniture Mart after the\nmeeting.\nWarren E.

    "text": "Chairman's Letter - 1986\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOur gain in net worth during 1986 was $492.5 million, or\n26.1%.\nOver the last 22 years (that is, since present management\ntook over), our per-share book value has grown from $19.46 to\n$2,073.06, or 23.3% compounded annually.\nBoth the numerator and\ndenominator are important in the per-share book value\ncalculation: during the 22-year period our corporate net worth\nhas increased 10,600% while shares outstanding have increased\nless than 1%.\nIn past reports I have noted that book value at most\ncompanies differs widely from intrinsic business value - the\nnumber that really counts for owners.\nIn our own case, however,\nbook value has served for more than a decade as a reasonable if\nsomewhat conservative proxy for business value.\nThat is, our\nbusiness value has moderately exceeded our book value, with the\nratio between the two remaining fairly steady.\nThe good news is that in 1986 our percentage gain in\nbusiness value probably exceeded the book value gain.\nI say\n\"probably\" because business value is a soft number: in our own\ncase, two equally well-informed observers might make judgments\nmore than 10% apart.\nA large measure of our improvement in business value\nrelative to book value reflects the outstanding performance of\nkey managers at our major operating businesses.\nThese managers -\nthe Blumkins, Mike Goldberg, the Heldmans, Chuck Huggins, Stan\nLipsey, and Ralph Schey - have over the years improved the\nearnings of their businesses dramatically while, except in the\ncase of insurance, utilizing little additional capital.\nThis\naccomplishment builds economic value, or \"Goodwill,\" that does\nnot show up in the net worth figure on our balance sheet, nor in\nour per-share book value.\nIn 1986 this unrecorded gain was\nsubstantial.\nSo much for the good news.\nThe bad news is that my\nperformance did not match that of our managers.\nWhile they were\ndoing a superb job in running our businesses, I was unable to\nskillfully deploy much of the capital they generated.\nCharlie Munger, our Vice Chairman, and I really have only\ntwo jobs.\nOne is to attract and keep outstanding managers to run\nour various operations.\nThis hasnt been all that difficult.\nUsually the managers came with the companies we bought, having\ndemonstrated their talents throughout careers that spanned a wide\nvariety of business circumstances.\nThey were managerial stars\nlong before they knew us, and our main contribution has been to\nnot get in their way.\nThis approach seems elementary: if my job\nwere to manage a golf team - and if Jack Nicklaus or Arnold\nPalmer were willing to play for me - neither would get a lot of\ndirectives from me about how to swing.\nSome of our key managers are independently wealthy (we hope\nthey all become so), but that poses no threat to their continued\ninterest: they work because they love what they do and relish the\nthrill of outstanding performance.\nThey unfailingly think like\nowners (the highest compliment we can pay a manager) and find all\naspects of their business absorbing.\n(Our prototype for occupational fervor is the Catholic\ntailor who used his small savings of many years to finance a\npilgrimage to the Vatican.\nWhen he returned, his parish held a\nspecial meeting to get his first-hand account of the Pope.\n\"Tell\nus,\" said the eager faithful, \"just what sort of fellow is he?\"\nOur hero wasted no words: \"Hes a forty-four, medium.\")\nCharlie and I know that the right players will make almost\nany team manager look good.\nWe subscribe to the philosophy of\nOgilvy & Mathers founding genius, David Ogilvy: \"If each of us\nhires people who are smaller than we are, we shall become a\ncompany of dwarfs.\nBut, if each of us hires people who are\nbigger than we are, we shall become a company of giants.\"\nA by-product of our managerial style is the ability it gives\nus to easily expand Berkshires activities.\nWeve read\nmanagement treatises that specify exactly how many people should\nreport to any one executive, but they make little sense to us.\nWhen you have able managers of high character running businesses\nabout which they are passionate, you can have a dozen or more\nreporting to you and still have time for an afternoon nap.\nConversely, if you have even one person reporting to you who is\ndeceitful, inept or uninterested, you will find yourself with\nmore than you can handle.\nCharlie and I could work with double\nthe number of managers we now have, so long as they had the rare\nqualities of the present ones.\nWe intend to continue our practice of working only with\npeople whom we like and admire.\nThis policy not only maximizes\nour chances for good results, it also ensures us an\nextraordinarily good time.\nOn the other hand, working with\npeople who cause your stomach to churn seems much like marrying\nfor money - probably a bad idea under any circumstances, but\nabsolute madness if you are already rich.\nThe second job Charlie and I must handle is the allocation\nof capital, which at Berkshire is a considerably more important\nchallenge than at most companies.\nThree factors make that so: we\nearn more money than average; we retain all that we earn; and, we\nare fortunate to have operations that, for the most part, require\nlittle incremental capital to remain competitive and to grow.\nObviously, the future results of a business earning 23% annually\nand retaining it all are far more affected by todays capital\nallocations than are the results of a business earning 10% and\ndistributing half of that to shareholders.\nIf our retained\nearnings - and those of our major investees, GEICO and Capital\nCities/ABC, Inc. - are employed in an unproductive manner, the\neconomics of Berkshire will deteriorate very quickly.\nIn a\ncompany adding only, say, 5% to net worth annually, capital-\nallocation decisions, though still important, will change the\ncompanys economics far more slowly.\nCapital allocation at Berkshire was tough work in 1986.\nWe\ndid make one business acquisition - The Fechheimer Bros.\nCompany, which we will discuss in a later section.\nFechheimer is\na company with excellent economics, run by exactly the kind of\npeople with whom we enjoy being associated.\nBut it is relatively\nsmall, utilizing only about 2% of Berkshires net worth.\nMeanwhile, we had no new ideas in the marketable equities\nfield, an area in which once, only a few years ago, we could\nreadily employ large sums in outstanding businesses at very\nreasonable prices.\nSo our main capital allocation moves in 1986\nwere to pay off debt and stockpile funds.\nNeither is a fate\nworse than death, but they do not inspire us to do handsprings\neither.\nIf Charlie and I were to draw blanks for a few years in\nour capital-allocation endeavors, Berkshires rate of growth\nwould slow significantly.\nWe will continue to look for operating businesses that meet\nour tests and, with luck, will acquire such a business every\ncouple of years.\nBut an acquisition will have to be large if it\nis to help our performance materially.\nUnder current stock\nmarket conditions, we have little hope of finding equities to buy\nfor our insurance companies.\nMarkets will change significantly -\nyou can be sure of that and some day we will again get our turn\nat bat.\nHowever, we havent the faintest idea when that might\nhappen.\nIt cant be said too often (although Im sure you feel Ive\ntried) that, even under favorable conditions, our returns are\ncertain to drop substantially because of our enlarged size.\nWe\nhave told you that we hope to average a return of 15% on equity\nand we maintain that hope, despite some negative tax law changes\ndescribed in a later section of this report.\nIf we are to\nachieve this rate of return, our net worth must increase $7.2\nbillion in the next ten years.\nA gain of that magnitude will be\npossible only if, before too long, we come up with a few very big\n(and good) ideas.\nCharlie and I cant promise results, but we do\npromise you that we will keep our efforts focused on our goals.\nSources of Reported Earnings\nThe table on the next page shows the major sources of\nBerkshires reported earnings.\nThis table differs in several\nways from the one presented last year.\nWe have added four new\nlines of business because of the Scott Fetzer and Fechheimer\nacquisitions. In the case of Scott Fetzer, the two major units\nacquired were World Book and Kirby, and each is presented\nseparately.\nFourteen other businesses of Scott Fetzer are\naggregated in Scott Fetzer - Diversified Manufacturing.\nSF\nFinancial Group, a credit company holding both World Book and\nKirby receivables, is included in \"Other.\" This year, because\nBerkshire is so much larger, we also have eliminated separate\nreporting for several of our smaller businesses.\nIn the table, amortization of Goodwill is not charged\nagainst the specific businesses but, for reasons outlined in the\nAppendix to my letter in the 1983 Annual Report, is aggregated as\na separate item. (A Compendium of earlier letters, including the\nGoodwill discussion, is available upon request.) Both the Scott\nFetzer and Fechheimer acquisitions created accounting Goodwill,\nwhich is why the amortization charge for Goodwill increased in\n1986.\nAdditionally, the Scott Fetzer acquisition required other\nmajor purchase-price accounting adjustments, as prescribed by\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\nThe GAAP\nfigures, of course, are the ones used in our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nBut, in our view, the GAAP figures are not\nnecessarily the most useful ones for investors or managers.\nTherefore, the figures shown for specific operating units are\nearnings before purchase-price adjustments are taken into\naccount.\nIn effect, these are the earnings that would have been\nreported by the businesses if we had not purchased them.\nA discussion of our reasons for preferring this form of\npresentation is in the Appendix to this letter.\nThis Appendix\nwill never substitute for a steamy novel and definitely is not\nrequired reading.\nHowever, I know that among our 6,000\nshareholders there are those who are thrilled by my essays on\naccounting - and I hope that both of you enjoy the Appendix.\nIn the Business Segment Data on pages 41-43 and in the\nManagements Discussion section on pages 45-49, you will find\nmuch additional information about our businesses.\nI urge you to\nread those sections, as well as Charlie Mungers letter to Wesco\nshareholders, describing the various businesses of that\nsubsidiary, which starts on page 50.\n(000s omitted)\n------------------------------------------\nBerkshire's Share\nof Net Earnings\n(after taxes and\nPre-Tax Earnings\nminority interests)\n-------------------\n-------------------\n1986\n1985\n1986\n1985\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nOperating Earnings:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting ............... $(55,844)\n$(44,230)\n$(29,864)\n$(23,569)\nNet Investment Income ......\n107,143\n95,217\n96,440\n79,716\nBuffalo News .................\n34,736\n29,921\n16,918\n14,580\nFechheimer (Acquired 6/3/86)\n8,400\n---\n3,792\n---\nKirby ........................\n20,218\n---\n10,508\n---\nNebraska Furniture Mart ......\n17,685\n12,686\n7,192\n5,181\nScott Fetzer -

which was similar to those existing in many metropolitan\nmarkets - was thought to be a \"natural\" one, accurately\nreflecting the local citizenrys appetite for a Sunday product.\nOur Sunday paper was started in late 1977.\nIt now has a\npenetration ratio of 83% and sells about 100,000 copies more each\nSunday than did the Courier-Express ten years ago - even though\npopulation in our market area has declined during the decade.\nIn\nrecent history, no other city that has long had a local Sunday\npaper has experienced a penetration gain anywhere close to\nBuffalos.\nDespite our exceptional market acceptance, our operating\nmargins almost certainly have peaked.\nA major newsprint price\nincrease took effect at the end of 1986, and our advertising rate\nincreases in 1987 will again be moderate compared to those of the\nindustry.\nHowever, even if margins should materially shrink, we\nwould not reduce our news-hole ratio.\nAs I write this, it has been exactly ten years since we\npurchased The News.\nThe financial rewards it has brought us have\nfar exceeded our expectations and so, too, have the non-financial\nrewards.\nOur respect for the News - high when we bought it - has\ngrown consistently ever since the purchase, as has our respect\nand admiration for Murray Light, the editor who turns out the\nproduct that receives such extraordinary community acceptance.\nThe efforts of Murray and Stan, which were crucial to the News\nduring its dark days of financial reversals and litigation, have\nnot in the least been lessened by prosperity.\nCharlie and I are\ngrateful to them.\no The amazing Blumkins continue to perform business miracles\nat Nebraska Furniture Mart.\nCompetitors come and go (mostly go),\nbut Mrs. B. and her progeny roll on.\nIn 1986 net sales increased\n10.2% to $132 million.\nTen years ago sales were $44 million and,\neven then, NFM appeared to be doing just about all of the\nbusiness available in the Greater Omaha Area.\nGiven NFMs\nremarkable dominance, Omahas slow growth in population and the\nmodest inflation rates that have applied to the goods NFM sells,\nhow can this operation continue to rack up such large sales\ngains?\nThe only logical explanation is that the marketing\nterritory of NFMs one-and-only store continues to widen because\nof its ever-growing reputation for rock-bottom everyday prices\nand the broadest of selections.\nIn preparation for further\ngains, NFM is expanding the capacity of its warehouse, located a\nfew hundred yards from the store, by about one-third.\nMrs. B, Chairman of Nebraska Furniture Mart, continues at\nage 93 to outsell and out-hustle any manager Ive ever seen.\nShes at the store seven days a week, from opening to close.\nCompeting with her represents a triumph of courage over judgment.\nIts easy to overlook what I consider to be the critical\nlesson of the Mrs. B saga: at 93, Omaha based Board Chairmen have\nyet to reach their peak.\nPlease file this fact away to consult\nbefore you mark your ballot at the 2024 annual meeting of\nBerkshire.\no At Sees, sales trends improved somewhat from those of\nrecent years.\nTotal pounds sold rose about 2%. (For you\nchocaholics who like to fantasize, one statistic: we sell over\n12,000 tons annually.) Same-store sales, measured in pounds, were\nvirtually unchanged.\nIn the previous six years, same store\npoundage fell, and we gained or maintained poundage volume only\nby adding stores.\nBut a particularly strong Christmas season in\n1986 stemmed the decline.\nBy stabilizing same-store volume and\nmaking a major effort to control costs, Sees was able to\nmaintain its excellent profit margin in 1986 though it put\nthrough only minimal price increases.\nWe have Chuck Huggins, our\nlong-time manager at Sees, to thank for this significant\nachievement.\nSees has a one-of-a-kind product \"personality\" produced by\na combination of its candys delicious taste and moderate price,\nthe companys total control of the distribution process, and the\nexceptional service provided by store employees.\nChuck\nrightfully measures his success by the satisfaction of our\ncustomers, and his attitude permeates the organization.\nFew\nmajor retailing companies have been able to sustain such a\ncustomer-oriented spirit, and we owe Chuck a great deal for\nkeeping it alive and well at Sees.\nSees profits should stay at about their present level.\nWe\nwill continue to increase prices very modestly, merely matching\nprospective cost increases.\no World Book is the largest of 17 Scott Fetzer operations\nthat joined Berkshire at the beginning of 1986.\nLast year I\nreported to you enthusiastically about the businesses of Scott\nFetzer and about Ralph Schey, its manager.\nA years experience\nhas added to my enthusiasm for both.\nRalph is a superb\nbusinessman and a straight shooter.\nHe also brings exceptional\nversatility and energy to his job: despite the wide array of\nbusinesses that he manages, he is on top of the operations,\nopportunities and problems of each.\nAnd, like our other\nmanagers, Ralph is a real pleasure to work with.\nOur good\nfortune continues.\nWorld Books unit volume increased for the fourth\nconsecutive year, with encyclopedia sales up 7% over 1985 and 45%\nover 1982.\nChildcrafts unit sales also grew significantly.\nWorld Book continues to dominate the U.S. direct-sales\nencyclopedia market - and for good reasons.\nExtraordinarily\nwell-edited and priced at under 5 cents per page, these books are\na bargain for youngster and adult alike.\nYou may find one\nediting technique interesting: World Book ranks over 44,000 words\nby difficulty.\nLonger entries in the encyclopedia include only\nthe most easily comprehended words in the opening sections, with\nthe difficulty of the material gradually escalating as the\nexposition proceeds.\nAs a result, youngsters can easily and\nprofitably read to the point at which subject matter gets too\ndifficult, instead of immediately having to deal with a\ndiscussion that mixes up words requiring college-level\ncomprehension with others of fourth-grade level.\nSelling World Book is a calling.\nOver one-half of our\nactive salespeople are teachers or former teachers, and another\n5% have had experience as librarians.\nThey correctly think of\nthemselves as educators, and they do a terrific job.\nIf you\ndont have a World Book set in your house, I recommend one.\no Kirby likewise recorded its fourth straight year of unit\nvolume gains.\nWorldwide, unit sales grew 4% from 1985 and 33%\nfrom 1982.\nWhile the Kirby product is more expensive than most\ncleaners, it performs in a manner that leaves cheaper units far\nbehind (\"in the dust,\" so to speak).\nMany 30- and 40-year-old\nKirby cleaners are still in active duty.\nIf you want the best,\nyou buy a Kirby.\nSome companies that historically have had great success in\ndirect sales have stumbled in recent years.\nCertainly the era of\nthe working woman has created new challenges for direct sales\norganizations.\nSo far, the record shows that both Kirby and\nWorld Book have responded most successfully.\nThe businesses described above, along with the insurance\noperation and Fechheimer, constitute our major business units.\nThe brevity of our descriptions is in no way meant to diminish\nthe importance of these businesses to us.\nAll have been\ndiscussed in past annual reports and, because of the tendency of\nBerkshire owners to stay in the fold (about 98% of the stock at\nthe end of each year is owned by people who were owners at the\nstart of the year), we want to avoid undue repetition of basic\nfacts.\nYou can be sure that we will immediately report to you in\ndetail if the underlying economics or competitive position of any\nof these businesses should materially change.\nIn general, the\nbusinesses described in this section can be characterized as\nhaving very strong market positions, very high returns on capital\nemployed, and the best of operating managements.\nThe Fechheimer Bros. Co.\nEvery year in Berkshires annual report I include a\ndescription of the kind of business that we would like to buy.\nThis \"ad\" paid off in 1986.\nOn January 15th of last year I received a letter from Bob\nHeldman of Cincinnati, a shareholder for many years and also\nChairman of Fechheimer Bros.\nUntil I read the letter, however, I\ndid not know of either Bob or Fechheimer.\nBob wrote that he ran\na company that met our tests and suggested that we get together,\nwhich we did in Omaha after their results for 1985 were compiled.\nHe filled me in on a little history: Fechheimer, a uniform\nmanufacturing and distribution business, began operations in\n1842.\nWarren Heldman, Bobs father, became involved in the\nbusiness in 1941 and his sons, Bob and George (now President),\nalong with their sons, subsequently joined the company.\nUnder\nthe Heldmans management, the business was highly successful.\nIn 1981 Fechheimer was sold to a group of venture\ncapitalists in a leveraged buy out (an LBO), with management\nretaining an equity interest.\nThe new company, as is the case\nwith all LBOS, started with an exceptionally high debt/equity\nratio.\nAfter the buy out, however, operations continued to be\nvery successful.\nSo by the start of last year debt had been paid\ndown substantially and the value of the equity had increased\ndramatically.\nFor a variety of reasons, the venture capitalists\nwished to sell and Bob, having dutifully read Berkshires annual\nreports, thought of us.\nFechheimer is exactly the sort of business we like to buy.\nIts economic record is superb; its managers are talented, high-\ngrade, and love what they do; and the Heldman family wanted to\ncontinue its financial interest in partnership with us.\nTherefore, we quickly purchased about 84% of the stock for a\nprice that was based upon a $55 million valuation for the entire\nbusiness.\nThe circumstances of this acquisition were similar to those\nprevailing in our purchase of Nebraska Furniture Mart: most of\nthe shares were held by people who wished to employ funds\nelsewhere; family members who enjoyed running their business\nwanted to continue both as owners and managers; several\ngenerations of the family were active in the business, providing\nmanagement for as far as the eye can see; and the managing family\nwanted a purchaser who would not re-sell, regardless of price,\nand who would let the business be run in the future as it had\nbeen in the past.\nBoth Fechheimer and NFM were right for us, and\nwe were right for them.\nYou may be amused to know that neither Charlie nor I have\nbeen to Cincinnati, headquarters for Fechheimer, to see their\noperation. (And, incidentally, it works both ways: Chuck Huggins,\nwho has been running Sees for 15 years, has never been to\nOmaha.) If our success were to depend upon insights we developed\nthrough plant inspections, Berkshire would be in big trouble.\nRather, in considering an acquisition, we attempt to evaluate the\neconomic characteristics of the business - its competitive\nstrengths and weaknesses - and the quality of the people we will\nbe joining.\nFechheimer was a standout in both respects.\nIn\naddition to Bob and George Heldman, who are in their mid-60s -\nspring chickens by our standards - there are three members of the\nnext generation, Gary, Roger and Fred, to insure continuity.\nAs a prototype for acquisitions, Fechheimer has only one\ndrawback: size.\nWe hope our next acquisition is at least several\ntimes as large but a carbon copy in all other respects.\nOur\nthreshold for minimum annual after-tax earnings of potential\nacquisitions has been moved up to $10 million from the $5 million\nlevel that prevailed when Bob wrote to me.\nFlushed with success, we repeat our ad.\nIf you have a\nbusiness that fits, call me or, preferably, write.\nHeres what were looking for:\n(1) large purchases (at least $10 million of after-tax\nearnings),\n(2) demonstrated consistent earning power (future\nprojections are of little interest to us, nor are\n\"turn-around\" situations),\n(3) businesses earning good returns on equity while\nemploying little or no debt.\n(4) management in place (we cant supply it),\n(5) simple businesses (if theres lots of technology, we\nwont understand it),\n(6) an offering price (we dont want to waste our time\nor that of the seller by talking, even preliminarily,\nabout a transaction when price is unknown).\nWe will not engage in unfriendly takeovers.\nWe can promise\ncomplete confidentiality and a very fast answer - customarily\nwithin five minutes - as to whether were interested.\nWe prefer\nto buy for cash, but will consider issuing stock when we receive\nas much in intrinsic business value as we give.\nIndeed,\nfollowing recent advances in the price of Berkshire stock,\ntransactions involving stock issuance may be quite feasible.\nWe\ninvite potential sellers to check us out by contacting people\nwith whom we have done business in the past.\nFor the right\nbusiness - and the right people - we can provide a good home.\nOn the other hand, we frequently get approached about\nacquisitions that dont come close to meeting our tests: new\nventures, turnarounds, auction-like sales, and the ever-popular\n(among brokers) \"Im-sure-something-will-work-out-if-you-people-\nget-to-know-each-other.\" None of these attracts us in the least.\n*\n*\n*\nBesides being interested in the purchases of entire\nbusinesses as described above, we are also interested in the\nnegotiated purchase of large, but not controlling, blocks of\nstock, as in our Cap Cities purchase.\nSuch purchases appeal to\nus only when we are very comfortable with both the economics of\nthe business and the ability and integrity of the people running\nthe operation.\nWe prefer large transactions: in the unusual case\nwe might do something as small as $50 million (or even smaller),\nbut our preference is for commitments many times that size.\nInsurance Operations\nWe present our usual table of industry figures, expanded\nthis year to include data about incurred losses and the GNP\ninflation index.\nThe contrast in 1986 between the growth in\npremiums and growth in incurred losses will show you why\nunderwriting results for the year improved materially:\nStatutory\nYearly Change\nCombined Ratio\nYearly Change\nInflation Rate\nin Premiums\nAfter Policyholder\nin Incurred\nMeasured by\nWritten (%)\nDividends\nLosses (%)\nGNP Deflator (%)\n-------------\n------------------\n-------------\n----------------\n1981 .....\n3.8\n106.0\n6.5\n9.7\n1982 .....\n4.4\n109.8\n8.4\n6.4\n1983 .....\n4.6\n112.0\n6.8\n3.9\n1984 .....\n9.2\n117.9\n16.9\n3.8\n1985 .....\n22.1\n116.5\n16.1\n3.3\n1986 (Est.)\n22.6\n108.5\n15.5\n2.6\nSource: Bests Insurance Management Reports\nThe combined ratio represents total insurance costs (losses\nincurred plus expenses) compared to revenue from premiums: a\nratio below 100 indicates an underwriting profit, and one above\n100 indicates a loss.\nWhen the investment income that an insurer\nearns from holding on to policyholders funds (\"the float\") is\ntaken into account, a combined ratio in the 107-112 range\ntypically produces an overall break-even result, exclusive of\nearnings on the funds provided by shareholders.\nThe math of the insurance business, encapsulated by the\ntable, is not very complicated.\nIn years when the industrys\nannual gain in revenues (premiums) pokes along at 4% or 5%,\nunderwriting losses are sure to mount.\nThis is not because auto\naccidents, fires, windstorms and the like are occurring more\nfrequently, nor has it lately been the fault of general\ninflation.\nToday, social and judicial inflation are the major\nculprits; the cost of entering a courtroom has simply ballooned.\nPart of the jump in cost arises from skyrocketing verdicts, and\npart from the tendency of judges and juries to expand the\ncoverage of insurance policies beyond that contemplated by the\ninsurer when the policies were written.\nSeeing no let-up in\neither trend, we continue to believe that the industrys revenues\nmust grow at close to 10% annually for it to just hold its own\nin terms of profitability, even though general inflation may be\nrunning only 2% - 4%.\nIn 1986, as noted, the industrys premium volume soared even\nfaster than loss costs.\nConsequently, the underwriting loss of\nthe industry fell dramatically.\nIn last years report we\npredicted this sharp improvement but also predicted that\nprosperity would be fleeting.\nAlas, this second prediction is\nalready proving accurate.\nThe rate of gain in the industrys\npremium volume has slowed significantly (from an estimated 27.1%\nin 1986s first quarter, to 23.5% in the second, to 21.8% in the\nthird, to 18.7% in the fourth), and we expect further slowing in\n1987.\nIndeed, the rate of gain may well fall below my 10%\n\"equilibrium\" figure by the third quarter.\nNevertheless, underwriting results in 1987, assuming they\nare not dragged down by a major natural catastrophe, will again\nimprove materially because price increases are recognized in\nrevenues on a lagged basis.\nIn effect, the good news in earnings\nfollows the good news in prices by six to twelve months.\nBut the\nimproving trend in earnings will probably end by late 1988 or\nearly 1989.\nThereafter the industry is likely to head south in a\nhurry.\nPricing behavior in the insurance industry continues to be\nexactly what can be expected in a commodity-type business.\nOnly\nunder shortage conditions are high profits achieved, and such\nconditions dont last long.\nWhen the profit sun begins to shine,\nlong-established insurers shower investors with new shares in\norder to build capital.\nIn addition, newly-formed insurers rush\nto sell shares at the advantageous prices available in the new-\nissue market (prices advantageous, that is, to the insiders\npromoting the company but rarely to the new shareholders).\nThese\nmoves guarantee future trouble: capacity soars, competitive\njuices flow, and prices fade.\nIts interesting to observe insurance leaders beseech their\ncolleagues to behave in a more \"statesmanlike\" manner when\npricing policies.\n\"Why,\" they ask, \"cant we learn from history,\neven out the peaks and valleys, and consistently price to make\nreasonable profits?\" What they wish, of course, is pricing that\nresembles, say, that of The Wall Street journal, whose prices are\nample to start with and rise consistently each year.\nSuch calls for improved behavior have all of the efficacy of\nthose made by a Nebraska corn grower asking his fellow growers,\nworldwide, to market their corn with more statesmanship.\nWhats\nneeded is not more statesmen, but less corn.\nBy raising large\namounts of capital in the last two years, the insurance industry\nhas, to continue our metaphor, vastly expanded its plantings of\ncorn.\nThe resulting increase in \"crop\" - i.e., the proliferation\nof insurance capacity - will have the same effect on prices and\nprofits that surplus crops have had since time immemorial.\nOur own insurance operation did well in 1986 and is also\nlikely to do well in 1987.\nWe have benefited significantly from\nindustry conditions.\nBut much of our prosperity arises from the\nefforts and ability of Mike Goldberg, manager of all insurance\noperations.\nOur combined ratio (on a statutory basis and excluding\nstructured settlements and financial reinsurance) fell from 111\nin 1985 to 103 in 1986.\nIn addition, our premium growth has been\nexceptional: although final figures arent available, I believe\nthat over the past two years we were the fastest growing company\namong the countrys top 100 insurers.\nSome of our growth, it is\ntrue, came from our large quota-share contract with Firemans\nFund, described in last years report and updated in Charlies\nletter on page 54.\nBut even if the premiums from that contract\nare excluded from the calculation, we probably still ranked first\nin growth.\nInterestingly, we were the slowest-growing large insurer in\nthe years immediately preceding 1985.\nIn fact, we shrank - and\nwe will do so again from time to time in the future.\nOur large\nswings in volume do not mean that we come and go from the\ninsurance marketplace.\nIndeed, we are its most steadfast\nparticipant, always standing ready, at prices we believe\nadequate, to write a wide variety of high-limit coverages.\nThe\nswings in our volume arise instead from the here-today, gone-\ntomorrow behavior of other insurers.\nWhen most insurers are\n\"gone,\" because their capital is inadequate or they have been\nfrightened by losses, insureds rush to us and find us ready to\ndo business.\nBut when hordes of insurers are \"here,\" and are\nslashing prices far below expectable costs, many customers\nnaturally leave us in order to take advantage of the bargains\ntemporarily being offered by our competition.\nOur firmness on prices works no hardship on the consumer: he\nis being bombarded by attractively priced insurance offers at\nthose times when we are doing little business.\nAnd it works no\nhardship on our employees: we dont engage in layoffs when we\nexperience a cyclical slowdown at one of our generally-profitable\ninsurance operations.\nThis no-layoff practice is in our self-\ninterest.\nEmployees who fear that large layoffs will accompany\nsizable reductions in premium volume will understandably produce\nscads of business through thick and thin (mostly thin).\nThe trends in National Indemnitys traditional business -\nthe writing of commercial auto and general liability policies\nthrough general agents - suggest how gun-shy other insurers\nbecame for a while and how brave they are now getting.\nIn the\nlast quarter of 1984, NICOs monthly volume averaged $5 million,\nabout what it had been running for several years.\nBy the first\nquarter of 1986, monthly volume had climbed to about $35 million.\nIn recent months, a sharp decline has set in.\nMonthly volume is\ncurrently about $20 million and will continue to fall as new\ncompetitors surface and prices are cut.\nIronically, the managers\nof certain major new competitors are the very same managers that\njust a few years ago bankrupted insurers that were our old\ncompetitors.\nThrough state-mandated guaranty funds, we must pay\nsome of the losses these managers left unpaid, and now we find\nthem writing the same sort of business under a new name.\nCest\nla guerre.\nThe business we call \"large risks\" expanded significantly\nduring 1986, and will be important to us in the future.\nIn this\noperation, we regularly write policies with annual premiums of $1\n- $3 million, or even higher.\nThis business will necessarily be\nhighly volatile - both in volume and profitability - but our\npremier capital position and willingness to write large net lines\nmake us a very strong force in the market when prices are right.\nOn the other hand, our structured settlement business has become\nnear-dormant because present prices make no sense to us.\nThe 1986 loss reserve development of our insurance group is\nchronicled on page 46.\nThe figures show the amount of error in\nour yearend 1985 liabilities that a year of settlements and\nfurther evaluation has revealed.\nAs you can see, what I told you\nlast year about our loss liabilities was far from true - and that\nmakes three years in a row of error.\nIf the physiological rules\nthat applied to Pinocchio were to apply to me, my nose would now\ndraw crowds.\nWhen insurance executives belatedly establish proper\nreserves, they often speak of \"reserve strengthening,\" a term\nthat has a rather noble ring to it.\nThey almost make it sound as\nif they are adding extra layers of strength to an already-solid\nbalance sheet.\nThats not the case: instead the term is a\neuphemism for what should more properly be called \"correction of\nprevious untruths\" (albeit non-intentional ones).\nWe made a special effort at the end of 1986 to reserve\naccurately.\nHowever, we tried just as hard at the end of 1985.\nOnly time will tell whether we have finally succeeded in\ncorrectly estimating our insurance liabilities.\nDespite the difficulties we have had in reserving and the\ncommodity economics of the industry, we expect our insurance\nbusiness to both grow and make significant amounts of money - but\nprogress will be distinctly irregular and there will be major\nunpleasant surprises from time to time.\nIts a treacherous\nbusiness and a wary attitude is essential.\nWe must heed Woody\nAllen: \"While the lamb may lie down with the lion, the lamb\nshouldnt count on getting a whole lot of sleep.\"\nIn our insurance operations we have an advantage in\nattitude, we have an advantage in capital, and we are developing\nan advantage in personnel.\nAdditionally, I like to think we have\nsome long-term edge in investing the float developed from\npolicyholder funds.\nThe nature of the business suggests that we\nwill need all of these advantages in order to prosper.\n*\n*\n*\nGEICO Corporation, 41% owned by Berkshire, had an\noutstanding year in 1986.\nIndustrywide, underwriting experience\nin personal lines did not improve nearly as much as it did in\ncommercial lines.\nBut GEICO, writing personal lines almost\nexclusively, improved its combined ratio to 96.9 and recorded a\n16% gain in premium volume.\nGEICO also continued to repurchase\nits own shares and ended the year with 5.5% fewer shares\noutstanding than it had at the start of the year.\nOur share of\nGEICOs premium volume is over $500 million, close to double that\nof only three years ago.\nGEICOs book of business is one of the\nbest in the world of insurance, far better indeed than\nBerkshires own book.\nThe most important ingredient in GEICOs success is rock-\nbottom operating costs, which set the company apart from\nliterally hundreds of competitors that offer auto insurance.\nThe\ntotal of GEICOs underwriting expense and loss adjustment expense\nin 1986 was only 23.5% of premiums.\nMany major companies show\npercentages 15 points higher than that.\nEven such huge direct\nwriters as Allstate and State Farm incur appreciably higher costs\nthan does GEICO.\nThe difference between GEICOs costs and those of its\ncompetitors is a kind of moat that protects a valuable and much-\nsought-after business castle.\nNo one understands this moat-\naround-the-castle concept better than Bill Snyder, Chairman of\nGEICO.\nHe continually widens the moat by driving down costs\nstill more, thereby defending and strengthening the economic\nfranchise.\nBetween 1985 and 1986, GEICOs total expense ratio\ndropped from 24.1% to the 23.5% mentioned earlier and, under\nBills leadership, the ratio is almost certain to drop further.\nIf it does - and if GEICO maintains its service and underwriting\nstandards - the companys future will be brilliant indeed.\nThe second stage of the GEICO rocket is fueled by Lou\nSimpson, Vice Chairman, who has run the companys investments\nsince late 1979.\nIndeed, its a little embarrassing for me, the\nfellow responsible for investments at Berkshire, to chronicle\nLous performance at GEICO.\nOnly my ownership of a controlling\nblock of Berkshire stock makes me secure enough to give you the\nfollowing figures, comparing the overall return of the equity\nportfolio at GEICO to that of the Standard & Poors 500:\nYear\nGEICOs Equities\nS&P 500\n----\n----------------\n-------\n1980 ..................\n23.7%\n32.3%\n1981 ..................\n5.4\n(5.0)\n1982 ..................\n45.8\n21.4\n1983 ..................\n36.0\n22.4\n1984 ..................\n21.8\n6.2\n1985 ..................\n45.8\n31.6\n1986 ..................\n38.7\n18.6\nThese are not only terrific figures but, fully as important,\nthey have been achieved in the right way.\nLou has consistently\ninvested in undervalued common stocks that, individually, were\nunlikely to present him with a permanent loss and that,\ncollectively, were close to risk-free.\nIn sum, GEICO is an exceptional business run by exceptional\nmanagers.\nWe are fortunate to be associated with them.\nMarketable Securities\nDuring 1986, our insurance companies purchased about $700\nmillion of tax-exempt bonds, most having a maturity of 8 to 12\nyears.\nYou might think that this commitment indicates a\nconsiderable enthusiasm for such bonds.\nUnfortunately, thats\nnot so: at best, the bonds are mediocre investments.\nThey simply\nseemed the least objectionable alternative at the time we bought\nthem, and still seem so. (Currently liking neither stocks nor\nbonds, I find myself the polar opposite of Mae West as she\ndeclared: \"I like only two kinds of men - foreign and domestic.\")\nWe must, of necessity, hold marketable securities in our\ninsurance companies and, as money comes in, we have only five\ndirections to go: (1) long-term common stock investments; (2)\nlong-term fixed-income securities; (3) medium-term fixed-income\nsecurities; (4) short-term cash equivalents; and (5) short-term\narbitrage commitments.\nCommon stocks, of course, are the most fun.\nWhen conditions\nare right that is, when companies with good economics and good\nmanagement sell well below intrinsic business value - stocks\nsometimes provide grand-slam home runs.\nBut we currently find no\nequities that come close to meeting our tests.\nThis statement in\nno way translates into a stock market prediction: we have no idea\n- and never have had - whether the market is going to go up,\ndown, or sideways in the near- or intermediate term future.\nWhat we do know, however, is that occasional outbreaks of\nthose two super-contagious diseases, fear and greed, will forever\noccur in the investment community.\nThe timing of these epidemics\nwill be unpredictable.\nAnd the market aberrations produced by\nthem will be equally unpredictable, both as to duration and\ndegree.\nTherefore, we never try to anticipate the arrival or\ndeparture of either disease.\nOur goal is more modest: we simply\nattempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy\nonly when others are fearful.\nAs this is written, little fear is visible in Wall Street.\nInstead, euphoria prevails - and why not?\nWhat could be more\nexhilarating than to participate in a bull market in which the\nrewards to owners of businesses become gloriously uncoupled from\nthe plodding performances of the businesses themselves.\nUnfortunately, however, stocks cant outperform businesses\nindefinitely.\nIndeed, because of the heavy transaction and investment\nmanagement costs they bear, stockholders as a whole and over the\nlong term must inevitably underperform the companies they own.\nIf American business, in aggregate, earns about 12% on equity\nannually, investors must end up earning significantly less.\nBull\nmarkets can obscure mathematical laws, but they cannot repeal\nthem.\nThe second category of investments open to our insurance\ncompanies is long-term bonds.\nThese are unlikely to be of\ninterest to us except in very special situations, such as the\nWashington Public Power Supply System #1, #2 and #3 issues,\ndiscussed in our 1984 report. (At yearend, we owned WPPSS issues\nhaving an amortized cost of $218 million and a market value of\n$310 million, paying us $31.7 million in annual tax-exempt\nincome.) Our aversion to long-term bonds relates to our fear that\nwe will see much higher rates of inflation within the next\ndecade.\nOver time, the behavior of our currency will be\ndetermined by the behavior of our legislators.\nThis relationship\nposes a continuing threat to currency stability - and a\ncorresponding threat to the owners of long-term bonds.\nWe continue to periodically employ money in the arbitrage\nfield.\nHowever, unlike most arbitrageurs, who purchase dozens of\nsecurities each year, we purchase only a few.\nWe restrict\nourselves to large deals that have been announced publicly and do\nnot bet on the come.\nTherefore, our potential profits are apt to\nbe small; but, with luck, our disappointments will also be few.\nOur yearend portfolio shown below includes one arbitrage\ncommitment, Lear-Siegler.\nOur balance sheet also includes a\nreceivable for $145 million, representing the money owed us (and\npaid a few days later) by Unilever, then in the process of\npurchasing Chesebrough-Ponds, another of our arbitrage holdings.\nArbitrage is an alternative to Treasury Bills as a short-term\nparking place for money - a choice that combines potentially\nhigher returns with higher risks.\nTo date, our returns from the\nfunds committed to arbitrage have been many times higher than\nthey would have been had we left those funds in Treasury Bills.\nNonetheless, one bad experience could change the scorecard\nmarkedly.\nWe also, though it takes some straining, currently view\nmedium-term tax-exempt bonds as an alternative to short-term\nTreasury holdings.\nBuying these bonds, we run a risk of\nsignificant loss if, as seems probable, we sell many of them well\nbefore maturity.\nHowever, we believe this risk is more than\ncounter-balanced first, by the much higher after-tax returns\ncurrently realizable from these securities as compared to\nTreasury Bills and second, by the possibility that sales will\nproduce an overall profit rather than a loss.\nOur expectation of\na higher total return, after allowing for the possibility of loss\nand after taking into account all tax effects, is a relatively\nclose call and could well be wrong.\nEven if we sell our bonds at\na fairly large loss, however, we may end up reaping a higher\nafter-tax return than we would have realized by repeatedly\nrolling over Treasury Bills.\nIn any event, you should know that our expectations for both\nthe stocks and bonds we now hold are exceptionally modest, given\ncurrent market levels.\nProbably the best thing that could happen\nto us is a market in which we would choose to sell many of our\nbond holdings at a significant loss in order to re-allocate funds\nto the far-better equity values then very likely to exist.\nThe\nbond losses I am talking about would occur if high interest rates\ncame along; the same rates would probably depress common stocks\nconsiderably more than medium-term bonds.\nWe show below our 1986 yearend net holdings in marketable\nequities. All positions with a market value of over $25 million\nare listed, and the interests attributable to minority\nshareholdings of Wesco Financial Corp. and Nebraska Furniture\nMart are excluded.\nNo. of Shares\nCost\nMarket\n-------------\n----------\n----------\n(000s omitted)\n2,990,000\nCapital Cities/ABC, Inc. .......\n$515,775\n$\n801,694\n6,850,000\nGEICO Corporation ..............\n45,713\n674,725\n2,379,200\nHandy & Harman .................\n27,318\n46,989\n489,300\nLear Siegler, Inc. .............\n44,064\n44,587\n1,727,765\nThe Washington Post Company ....\n9,731\n269,531\n----------\n----------\n642,601\n1,837,526\nAll Other Common Stockholdings\n12,763\n36,507\n----------\n----------\nTotal Common Stocks ............\n$655,364\n$1,874,033\nWe should note that we expect to keep permanently our three\nprimary holdings, Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., GEICO Corporation,\nand The Washington Post.\nEven if these securities were to appear\nsignificantly overpriced, we would not anticipate selling them,\njust as we would not sell Sees or Buffalo Evening News if\nsomeone were to offer us a price far above what we believe those\nbusinesses are worth.\nThis attitude may seem old-fashioned in a corporate world in\nwhich activity has become the order of the day.\nThe modern\nmanager refers to his \"portfolio\" of businesses - meaning that\nall of them are candidates for \"restructuring\" whenever such a\nmove is dictated by Wall Street preferences, operating conditions\nor a new corporate \"concept.\" (Restructuring is defined narrowly,\nhowever: it extends only to dumping offending businesses, not to\ndumping the officers and directors who bought the businesses in\nthe first place.\n\"Hate the sin but love the sinner\" is a\ntheology as popular with the Fortune 500 as it is with the\nSalvation Army.)\nInvestment managers are even more hyperkinetic: their\nbehavior during trading hours makes whirling dervishes appear\nsedated by comparison.\nIndeed, the term \"institutional investor\"\nis becoming one of those self-contradictions called an oxymoron,\ncomparable to \"jumbo shrimp,\" \"lady mudwrestler\" and \"inexpensive\nlawyer.\"\nDespite the enthusiasm for activity that has swept business\nand financial America, we will stick with our til-death-do-us-\npart policy. Its the only one with which Charlie and I are\ncomfortable, it produces decent results, and it lets our managers\nand those of our investees run their businesses free of\ndistractions.\nNHP, Inc.\nLast year we paid $23.7 million for about 50% of NHP, Inc.,\na developer, syndicator, owner and manager of multi-family rental\nhousing.\nShould all executive stock options that have been\nauthorized be granted and exercised, our equity interest will\ndecline to slightly over 45%.\nNHP, Inc. has a most unusual genealogy.\nIn 1967, President\nJohnson appointed a commission of business and civic leaders, led\nby Edgar Kaiser, to study ways to increase the supply of\nmultifamily housing for low- and moderate-income tenants.\nCertain members of the commission subsequently formed and\npromoted two business entities to foster this goal.\nBoth are now\nowned by NHP, Inc. and one operates under unusual ground rules:\nthree of its directors must be appointed by the President, with\nthe advice and consent of the Senate, and it is also required by\nlaw to submit an annual report to the President.\nOver 260 major corporations, motivated more by the idea of\npublic service than profit, invested $42 million in the two\noriginal entities, which promptly began, through partnerships, to\ndevelop government-subsidized rental property.\nThe typical\npartnership owned a single property and was largely financed by a\nnon-recourse mortgage.\nMost of the equity money for each\npartnership was supplied by a group of limited partners who were\nprimarily attracted by the large tax deductions that went with\nthe investment.\nNHP acted as general partner and also purchased\na small portion of each partnerships equity.\nThe Governments housing policy has, of course, shifted and\nNHP has necessarily broadened its activities to include non-\nsubsidized apartments commanding market-rate rents.\nIn addition,\na subsidiary of NHP builds single-family homes in the Washington,\nD.C. area, realizing revenues of about $50 million annually.\nNHP now oversees about 500 partnership properties that are\nlocated in 40 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico,\nand that include about 80,000 housing units.\nThe cost of these\nproperties was more than $2.5 billion and they have been well\nmaintained.\nNHP directly manages about 55,000 of the housing\nunits and supervises the management of the rest.\nThe companys\nrevenues from management are about $16 million annually, and\ngrowing.\nIn addition to the equity interests it purchased upon the\nformation of each partnership, NHP owns varying residual\ninterests that come into play when properties are disposed of and\ndistributions are made to the limited partners.\nThe residuals on\nmany of NHPs \"deep subsidy\" properties are unlikely to be of\nmuch value.\nBut residuals on certain other properties could\nprove quite valuable, particularly if inflation should heat up.\nThe tax-oriented syndication of properties to individuals\nhas been halted by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.\nIn the main, NHP\nis currently trying to develop equity positions or significant\nresidual interests in non-subsidized rental properties of quality\nand size (typically 200 to 500 units).\nIn projects of this kind,\nNHP usually works with one or more large institutional investors\nor lenders.\nNHP will continue to seek ways to develop low- and\nmoderate-income apartment housing, but will not likely meet\nsuccess unless government policy changes.\nBesides ourselves, the large shareholders in NHP are\nWeyerhauser (whose interest is about 25%) and a management group\nled by Rod Heller, chief executive of NHP.\nAbout 60 major\ncorporations also continue to hold small interests, none larger\nthan 2%.\nTaxation\nThe Tax Reform Act of 1986 affects our various businesses in\nimportant and divergent ways.\nAlthough we find much to praise in\nthe Act, the net financial effect for Berkshire is negative: our\nrate of increase in business value is likely to be at least\nmoderately slower under the new law than under the old.\nThe net\neffect for our shareholders is even more negative: every dollar\nof increase in per-share business value, assuming the increase is\naccompanied by an equivalent dollar gain in the market value of\nBerkshire stock, will produce 72 cents of after-tax gain for our\nshareholders rather than the 80 cents produced under the old law.\nThis result, of course, reflects the rise in the maximum tax rate\non personal capital gains from 20% to 28%.\nHere are the main tax changes that affect Berkshire:\no The tax rate on corporate ordinary income is scheduled to\ndecrease from 46% in 1986 to 34% in 1988.\nThis change obviously\naffects us positively - and it also has a significant positive\neffect on two of our three major investees, Capital Cities/ABC\nand The Washington Post Company.\nI say this knowing that over the years there has been a lot\nof fuzzy and often partisan commentary about who really pays\ncorporate taxes - businesses or their customers.\nThe argument,\nof course, has usually turned around tax increases, not\ndecreases.\nThose people resisting increases in corporate rates\nfrequently argue that corporations in reality pay none of the\ntaxes levied on them but, instead, act as a sort of economic\npipeline, passing all taxes through to consumers.\nAccording to\nthese advocates, any corporate-tax increase will simply lead to\nhigher prices that, for the corporation, offset the increase.\nHaving taken this position, proponents of the \"pipeline\" theory\nmust also conclude that a tax decrease for corporations will not\nhelp profits but will instead flow through, leading to\ncorrespondingly lower prices for consumers.\nConversely, others argue that corporations not only pay the\ntaxes levied upon them, but absorb them also.\nConsumers, this\nschool says, will be unaffected by changes in corporate rates.\nWhat really happens?\nWhen the corporate rate is cut, do\nBerkshire, The Washington Post, Cap Cities, etc., themselves soak\nup the benefits, or do these companies pass the benefits along to\ntheir customers in the form of lower prices?\nThis is an\nimportant question for investors and managers, as well as for\npolicymakers.\nOur conclusion is that in some cases the benefits of lower\ncorporate taxes fall exclusively, or almost exclusively, upon the\ncorporation and its shareholders, and that in other cases the\nbenefits are entirely, or almost entirely, passed through to the\ncustomer.\nWhat determines the outcome is the strength of the\ncorporations business franchise and whether the profitability of\nthat franchise is regulated.\nFor example, when the franchise is strong and after-tax\nprofits are regulated in a relatively precise manner, as is the\ncase with electric utilities, changes in corporate tax rates are\nlargely reflected in prices, not in profits.\nWhen taxes are cut,\nprices will usually be reduced in short order.\nWhen taxes are\nincreased, prices will rise, though often not as promptly.\nA similar result occurs in a second arena - in the price-\ncompetitive industry, whose companies typically operate with very\nweak business franchises.\nIn such industries, the free market\n\"regulates\" after-tax profits in a delayed and irregular, but\ngenerally effective, manner.\nThe marketplace, in effect,\nperforms much the same function in dealing with the price-\ncompetitive industry as the Public Utilities Commission does in\ndealing with electric utilities.\nIn these industries, therefore,\ntax changes eventually affect prices more than profits.\nIn the case of unregulated businesses blessed with strong\nfranchises, however, its a different story:\nthe corporation\nand its shareholders are then the major beneficiaries of tax\ncuts.\nThese companies benefit from a tax cut much as the\nelectric company would if it lacked a regulator to force down\nprices.\nMany of our businesses, both those we own in whole and in\npart, possess such franchises.\nConsequently, reductions in their\ntaxes largely end up in our pockets rather than the pockets of\nour customers.\nWhile this may be impolitic to state, it is\nimpossible to deny.\nIf you are tempted to believe otherwise,\nthink for a moment of the most able brain surgeon or lawyer in\nyour area.\nDo you really expect the fees of this expert (the\nlocal \"franchise-holder\" in his or her specialty) to be reduced\nnow that the top personal tax rate is being cut from 50% to 28%?\nYour joy at our conclusion that lower rates benefit a number\nof our operating businesses and investees should be severely\ntempered, however, by another of our convictions: scheduled 1988\ntax rates, both individual and corporate, seem totally\nunrealistic to us.\nThese rates will very likely bestow a fiscal\nproblem on Washington that will prove incompatible with price\nstability.\nWe believe, therefore, that ultimately - within, say,\nfive years - either higher tax rates or higher inflation rates\nare almost certain to materialize.\nAnd it would not surprise us\nto see both.\no Corporate capital gains tax rates have been increased from\n28% to 34%, effective in 1987.\nThis change will have an\nimportant adverse effect on Berkshire because we expect much of\nour gain in business value in the future, as in the past, to\narise from capital gains.\nFor example, our three major\ninvestment holdings - Cap Cities, GEICO, and Washington Post - at\nyearend had a market value of over $1.7 billion, close to 75% of\nthe total net worth of Berkshire, and yet they deliver us only\nabout $9 million in annual income.\nInstead, all three retain a\nvery high percentage of their earnings, which we expect to\neventually deliver us capital gains.\nThe new law increases the rate for all gains realized in the\nfuture, including the unrealized gains that existed before the\nlaw was enacted.\nAt yearend, we had $1.2 billion of such\nunrealized gains in our equity investments.\nThe effect of the new\nlaw on our balance sheet will be delayed because a GAAP rule\nstipulates that the deferred tax liability applicable to\nunrealized gains should be stated at last years 28% tax rate\nrather than the current 34% rate.\nThis rule is expected to change\nsoon.\nThe moment it does, about $73 million will disappear from\nour GAAP net worth and be added to the deferred tax account.\no Dividend and interest income received by our insurance\ncompanies will be taxed far more heavily under the new law.\nFirst, all corporations will be taxed on 20% of the dividends\nthey receive from other domestic corporations, up from 15% under\nthe old law.\nSecond, there is a change concerning the residual\n80% that applies only to property/casualty companies: 15% of that\nresidual will be taxed if the stocks paying the dividends were\npurchased after August 7, 1986.\nA third change, again applying\nonly to property/casualty companies, concerns tax-exempt bonds:\ninterest on bonds purchased by insurers after August 7, 1986 will\nonly be 85% tax-exempt.\nThe last two changes are very important.\nThey mean that our\nincome from the investments we make in future years will be\nsignificantly lower than would have been the case under the old\nlaw.\nMy best guess is that these changes alone will eventually\nreduce the earning power of our insurance operation by at least\n10% from what we could previously have expected.\no The new tax law also materially changes the timing of tax\npayments by property/casualty insurance companies.\nOne new rule\nrequires us to discount our loss reserves in our tax returns, a\nchange that will decrease deductions and increase taxable income.\nAnother rule, to be phased in over six years, requires us to\ninclude 20% of our unearned premium reserve in taxable income.\nNeither rule changes the amount of the annual tax accrual in\nour reports to you, but each materially accelerates the schedule\nof payments.\nThat is, taxes formerly deferred will now be front-\nended, a change that will significantly cut the profitability of\nour business.\nAn analogy will suggest the toll: if, upon turning\n21, you were required to immediately pay tax on all income you\nwere due to receive throughout your life, both your lifetime\nwealth and your estate would be a small fraction of what they\nwould be if all taxes on your income were payable only when you\ndied.\nAttentive readers may spot an inconsistency in what we say.\nEarlier, discussing companies in price-competitive industries, we\nsuggested that tax increases or reductions affect these companies\nrelatively little, but instead are largely passed along to their\ncustomers.\nBut now we are saying that tax increases will affect\nprofits of Berkshires property/casualty companies even though\nthey operate in an intensely price-competitive industry.\nThe reason this industry is likely to be an exception to our\ngeneral rule is that not all major insurers will be working with\nidentical tax equations.\nImportant differences will exist for\nseveral reasons: a new alternative minimum tax will materially\naffect some companies but not others; certain major insurers have\nhuge loss carry-forwards that will largely shield their income\nfrom significant taxes for at least a few years; and the results\nof some large insurers will be folded into the consolidated\nreturns of companies with non-insurance businesses.\nThese\ndisparate conditions will produce widely varying marginal tax\nrates in the property/casualty industry.\nThat will not be the\ncase, however, in most other price-competitive industries, such\nas aluminum, autos and department stores, in which the major\nplayers will generally contend with similar tax equations.\nThe absence of a common tax calculus for property/casualty\ncompanies means that the increased taxes falling on the industry\nwill probably not be passed along to customers to the degree that\nthey would in a typical price-competitive industry.\nInsurers, in\nother words, will themselves bear much of the new tax burdens.\no A partial offset to these burdens is a \"fresh start\"\nadjustment that occurred on January 1, 1987 when our December 31,\n1986 loss reserve figures were converted for tax purposes to the\nnewly-required discounted basis. (In our reports to you, however,\nreserves will remain on exactly the same basis as in the past -\nundiscounted except in special cases such as structured\nsettlements.) The net effect of the \"fresh start\" is to give us a\ndouble deduction: we will get a tax deduction in 1987 and future\nyears for a portion of our-incurred-but-unpaid insurance losses\nthat have already been fully deducted as costs in 1986 and\nearlier years.\nThe increase in net worth that is produced by this change is\nnot yet reflected in our financial statements.\nRather, under\npresent GAAP rules (which may be changed), the benefit will flow\ninto the earnings statement and, consequently, into net worth\nover the next few years by way of reduced tax charges.\nWe expect\nthe total benefit from the fresh-start adjustment to be in the\n$30 - $40 million range.\nIt should be noted, however, that this\nis a one-time benefit, whereas the negative impact of the other\ninsurance-related tax changes is not only ongoing but, in\nimportant respects, will become more severe as time passes.\no The General Utilities Doctrine was repealed by the new tax\nlaw. This means that in 1987 and thereafter there will be a\ndouble tax on corporate liquidations, one at the corporate level\nand another at the shareholder level.\nIn the past, the tax at\nthe corporate level could be avoided, If Berkshire, for example,\nwere to be liquidated - which it most certainly wont be -\nshareholders would, under the new law, receive far less from the\nsales of our properties than they would have if the properties\nhad been sold in the past, assuming identical prices in each\nsale.\nThough this outcome is theoretical in our case, the change\nin the law will very materially affect many companies.\nTherefore, it also affects our evaluations of prospective\ninvestments.\nTake, for example, producing oil and gas\nbusinesses, selected media companies, real estate companies, etc.\nthat might wish to sell out.\nThe values that their shareholders\ncan realize are likely to be significantly reduced simply because\nthe General Utilities Doctrine has been repealed - though the\ncompanies operating economics will not have changed adversely at\nall.\nMy impression is that this important change in the law has\nnot yet been fully comprehended by either investors or managers.\nThis section of our report has been longer and more\ncomplicated than I would have liked.\nBut the changes in the law\nare many and important, particularly for property/casualty\ninsurers.\nAs I have noted, the new law will hurt Berkshires\nresults, but the negative impact is impossible to quantify with\nany precision.\nMiscellaneous\nWe bought a corporate jet last year.\nWhat you have heard about such\nplanes is true: they are very expensive and a luxury in\nsituations like ours where little travel to out-of-the-way places\nis required.\nAnd planes not only cost a lot to operate, they cost\na lot just to look at.\nPre-tax, cost of capital plus depreciation\non a new $15 million plane probably runs $3 million annually.\nOn\nour own plane, bought for $850,000 used, such costs run close to\n$200,000 annually.\nCognizant of such figures, your Chairman, unfortunately, has\nin the past made a number of rather intemperate remarks about\ncorporate jets.\nAccordingly, prior to our purchase, I was forced\ninto my Galileo mode.\nI promptly experienced the necessary\n\"counter-revelation\" and travel is now considerably easier - and\nconsiderably costlier - than in the past.\nWhether Berkshire will\nget its moneys worth from the plane is an open question, but I\nwill work at achieving some business triumph that I can (no\nmatter how dubiously) attribute to it.\nIm afraid Ben Franklin\nhad my number.\nSaid he: \"So convenient a thing it is to be a\nreasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a\nreason for everything one has a mind to do.\"\nAbout 97% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshires\n1986 shareholder-designated contributions program.\nContributions\nmade through the program were $4 million, and 1,934 charities\nwere recipients.\nWe urge new shareholders to read the description of our\nshareholder-designated contributions program that appears on\npages 58 and 59.\nIf you wish to participate in future programs,\nwe strongly urge that you immediately make sure your shares are\nregistered in the name of the actual owner, not in \"street\" name\nor nominee name.\nShares not so registered on September 30, 1987\nwill be ineligible for the 1987 program.\n*\n*\n*\nLast year almost 450 people attended our shareholders\nmeeting, up from about 250 the year before (and from about a\ndozen ten years ago).\nI hope you can join us on May 19th in\nOmaha.\nCharlie and I like to answer owner-related questions\nand I can promise you that our shareholders will pose many good\nones.\nFinishing up the questions may take quite a while - we\nhad about 65 last year so you should feel free to leave once\nyour own have been answered.\nLast year, after the meeting, one shareholder from New\nJersey and another from New York went to the Furniture Mart,\nwhere each purchased a $5,000 Oriental rug from Mrs. B. (To be\nprecise, they purchased rugs that might cost $10,000 elsewhere\nfor which they were charged about $5,000.) Mrs. B was pleased -\nbut not satisfied - and she will be looking for you at the store\nafter this years meeting.\nUnless our shareholders top last\nyears record, Ill be in trouble.\nSo do me (and yourself) a\nfavor, and go see her.\nWarren E.

In the \"O\" (for \"old\") column we have shown what the company's 1986 GAAP earnings would have been if we had not purchased it; in the \"N\" (for \"new\") column we have shown Scott Fetzer's GAAP earnings as actually reported by Berkshire.\nIt should be emphasized that the two columns depict identical economics - i.e., the same sales, wages, taxes, etc. And both \"companies\" generate the same amount of cash for owners. Only the accounting is different.\nSo, fellow philosophers, which column presents truth? Upon which set of numbers should managers and investors focus?\nBefore we tackle those questions, let's look at what produces the disparity between O and N. We will simplify our discussion in some respects, but the simplification should not produce any inaccuracies in analysis or conclusions.\nThe contrast between O and N comes about because we paid an amount for Scott Fetzer that was different from its stated net worth. Under GAAP, such differences - such premiums or discounts - must be accounted for by \"purchase-price adjustments.\" In Scott Fetzer's case, we paid $315 million for net assets that were carried on its books at $172.4 million. So we paid a premium of $142.6 million.\nThe first step in accounting for any premium paid is to adjust the carrying value of current assets to current values. In practice, this requirement usually does not affect receivables, which are routinely carried at current value, but often affects inventories. Because of a $22.9 million LIFO reserve and other accounting intricacies, Scott Fetzer's inventory account was carried at a $37.3 million discount from current value. So, making our first accounting move, we used $37.3 million of our $142.6 million premium to increase the carrying value of the inventory.\nAssuming any premium is left after current assets are adjusted, the next step is to adjust fixed assets to current value. In our case, this adjustment also required a few accounting acrobatics relating to deferred taxes. Since this has been billed as a simplified discussion, I will skip the details and give you the bottom line: $68.0 million was added to fixed assets and $13.0 million was eliminated from deferred tax liabilities. After making this $81.0 million adjustment, we were left with $24.3 million of premium to allocate.\nHad our situation called for them two steps would next have been required: the adjustment of intangible assets other than Goodwill to current fair values, and the restatement of liabilities to current fair values, a requirement that typically affects only long-term debt and unfunded pension liabilities. In Scott Fetzer's case, however, neither of these steps was necessary.\nThe final accounting adjustment we needed to make, after recording fair market values for all assets and liabilities, was the assignment of the residual premium to Goodwill (technically known as \"excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired\"). This residual amounted to $24.3 million. Thus, the balance sheet of Scott Fetzer immediately before the acquisition, which is summarized below in column O, was transformed by the purchase into the balance sheet shown in column N. In real terms, both balance sheets depict the same assets and liabilities - but, as you can see, certain figures differ significantly.\nCompany O\nCompany N\n(000s Omitted)\nAssets\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n...\n$ 3,593\n$ 3,593\nReceivables, net\n..\n90,919\n90,919\nInventories\n77,489\n114,764\nOther\n.\n5,954\n5,954\nTotal Current Assets\n..\n177,955\n215,230\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment, net\n.\n80,967\n148,960\nInvestments in and Advances to Unconsolidated Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures\n93,589\n93,589\nOther Assets, including Goodwill\n.\n9,836\n34,210\n$362,347\n$491,989\nLiabilities\nNotes Payable and Current Portion of Long-term Debt\n$ 4,650\n$ 4,650\nAccounts Payable\n...\n39,003\n39,003\nAccrued Liabilities\n..\n84,939\n84,939\nTotal Current Liabilities\n..\n128,592\n128,592\nLong-term Debt and Capitalized Leases\n.\n34,669\n34,669\nDeferred Income Taxes\n..\n17,052\n4,075\nOther Deferred Credits\n9,657\n9,657\nTotal Liabilities\n189,970\n176,993\nShareholders' Equity\n...\n172,377\n314,996\n$362,347\n$491,989\n========\n========\nThe higher balance sheet figures shown in column N produce the lower income figures shown in column N of the earnings statement presented earlier. This is the result of the asset write-ups and of the fact that some of the written-up assets must be depreciated or amortized. The higher the asset figure, the higher the annual depreciation or amortization charge to earnings must be. The charges that flowed to the earnings statement because of the balance sheet write-ups were numbered in the statement of earnings shown earlier:\n$4,979,000 for non-cash inventory costs resulting, primarily, from reductions that Scott Fetzer made in its inventories during 1986; charges of this kind are apt to be small or non-existent in future years.\n$5,054,000 for extra depreciation attributable to the write-up of fixed assets; a charge approximating this amount will probably be made annually for 12 more years.\n$595,000 for amortization of Goodwill; this charge will be made annually for 39 more years in a slightly larger amount because our purchase was made on January 6 and, therefore, the 1986 figure applies to only 98% of the year.\n$998,000 for deferred-tax acrobatics that are beyond my ability to explain briefly (or perhaps even non-briefly); a charge approximating this amount will probably be made annually for 12 more years.\nIt is important to understand that none of these newly-created accounting costs, totaling $11.6 million, are deductible for income tax purposes. The \"new\" Scott Fetzer pays exactly the same tax as the \"old\" Scott Fetzer would have, even though the GAAP earnings of the two entities differ greatly. And, in respect to operating earnings, that would be true in the future also. However, in the unlikely event that Scott Fetzer sells one of its businesses, the tax consequences to the \"old\" and \"new\" company might differ widely.\nBy the end of 1986 the difference between the net worth of the \"old\" and \"new\" Scott Fetzer had been reduced from $142.6 million to $131.0 million by means of the extra $11.6 million that was charged to earnings of the new entity. As the years go by, similar charges to earnings will cause most of the premium to disappear, and the two balance sheets will converge. However, the higher land values and most of the higher inventory values that were established on the new balance sheet will remain unless land is disposed of or inventory levels are further reduced.\n* * *\nWhat does all this mean for owners? Did the shareholders of Berkshire buy a business that earned $40.2 million in 1986 or did they buy one earning $28.6 million? Were those $11.6 million of new charges a real economic cost to us? Should investors pay more for the stock of Company O than of Company N? And, if a business is worth some given multiple of earnings, was Scott Fetzer worth considerably more the day before we bought it than it was worth the following day?\nIf we think through these questions, we can gain some insights about what may be called \"owner earnings.\" These represent (a) reported earnings plus (b) depreciation, depletion, amortization, and certain other non-cash charges such as Company N's items (1) and (4) less ( c) the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment, etc. that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive position and its unit volume. (If the business requires additional working capital to maintain its competitive position and unit volume, the increment also should be included in ( c) . However, businesses following the LIFO inventory method usually do not require additional working capital if unit volume does not change.)\nOur owner-earnings equation does not yield the deceptively precise figures provided by GAAP, since( c) must be a guess - and one sometimes very difficult to make. Despite this problem, we consider the owner earnings figure, not the GAAP figure, to be the relevant item for valuation purposes - both for investors in buying stocks and for managers in buying entire businesses. We agree with Keynes's observation: \"I would rather be vaguely right than precisely wrong.\"\nThe approach we have outlined produces \"owner earnings\" for Company O and Company N that are identical, which means valuations are also identical, just as common sense would tell you should be the case. This result is reached because the sum of (a) and (b) is the same in both columns O and N, and because( c) is necessarily the same in both cases.\nAnd what do Charlie and I, as owners and managers, believe is the correct figure for the owner earnings of Scott Fetzer? Under current circumstances, we believe ( c) is very close to the \"old\" company's (b) number of $8.3 million and much below the \"new\" company's (b) number of $19.9 million. Therefore, we believe that owner earnings are far better depicted by the reported earnings in the O column than by those in the N column. In other words, we feel owner earnings of Scott Fetzer are considerably larger than the GAAP figures that we report.\nThat is obviously a happy state of affairs. But calculations of this sort usually do not provide such pleasant news. Most managers probably will acknowledge that they need to spend something more than (b) on their businesses over the longer term just to hold their ground in terms of both unit volume and competitive position. When this imperative exists - that is, when ( c) exceeds (b) - GAAP earnings overstate owner earnings. Frequently this overstatement is substantial. The oil industry has in recent years provided a conspicuous example of this phenomenon. Had most major oil companies spent only (b) each year, they would have guaranteed their shrinkage in real terms.\nAll of this points up the absurdity of the \"cash flow\" numbers that are often set forth in Wall Street reports. These numbers routinely include (a) plus (b) - but do not subtract ( c) . Most sales brochures of investment bankers also feature deceptive presentations of this kind. These imply that the business being offered is the commercial counterpart of the Pyramids - forever state-of-the-art, never needing to be replaced, improved or refurbished. Indeed, if all U.S. corporations were to be offered simultaneously for sale through our leading investment bankers - and if the sales brochures describing them were to be believed - governmental projections of national plant and equipment spending would have to be slashed by 90%.\n\"Cash Flow\", true, may serve as a shorthand of some utility in descriptions of certain real estate businesses or other enterprises that make huge initial outlays and only tiny outlays thereafter. A company whose only holding is a bridge or an extremely long-lived gas field would be an example. But \"cash flow\" is meaningless in such businesses as manufacturing, retailing, extractive companies, and utilities because, for them, ( c) is always significant. To be sure, businesses of this kind may in a given year be able to defer capital spending. But over a five- or ten-year period, they must make the investment - or the business decays.\nWhy, then, are \"cash flow\" numbers so popular today? In answer, we confess our cynicism: we believe these numbers are frequently used by marketers of businesses and securities in attempts to justify the unjustifiable (and thereby to sell what should be the unsalable). When (a) - that is, GAAP earnings - looks by itself inadequate to service debt of a junk bond or justify a foolish stock price, how convenient it becomes for salesmen to focus on (a) + (b). But you shouldn't add (b) without subtracting ( c) : though dentists correctly claim that if you ignore your teeth they'll go away, the same is not true for ( c) . The company or investor believing that the debt-servicing ability or the equity valuation of an enterprise can be measured by totaling (a) and (b) while ignoring ( c) is headed for certain trouble.\n* * *\nTo sum up: in the case of both Scott Fetzer and our other businesses, we feel that (b) on an historical-cost basis - i.e., with both amortization of intangibles and other purchase-price adjustments excluded - is quite close in amount to ( c) . (The two items are not identical, of course. For example, at See's we annually make capitalized expenditures that exceed depreciation by $500,000 to $1 million, simply to hold our ground competitively.) Our conviction about this point is the reason we show our amortization and other purchase-price adjustment items separately in the table on page 8 and is also our reason for viewing the earnings of the individual businesses as reported there as much more closely approximating owner earnings than the GAAP figures.\nQuestioning GAAP figures may seem impious to some. After all, what are we paying the accountants for if it is not to deliver us the \"truth\" about our business. But the accountants' job is to record, not to evaluate. The evaluation job falls to investors and managers.\nAccounting numbers, of course, are the language of business and as such are of enormous help to anyone evaluating the worth of a business and tracking its progress. Charlie and I would be lost without these numbers: they invariably are the starting point for us in evaluating our own businesses and those of others. Managers and owners need to remember, however, that accounting is but an aid to business thinking, never a substitute for it.",

    "text": "Chairman's Letter - 1987\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOur gain in net worth during 1987 was $464 million, or\n19.5%.\nOver the last 23 years (that is, since present management\ntook over), our per-share book value has grown from $19.46 to\n$2,477.47, or at a rate of 23.1% compounded annually.\nWhat counts, of course, is the rate of gain in per-share\nbusiness value, not book value.\nIn many cases, a corporation's\nbook value and business value are almost totally unrelated.\nFor\nexample, just before they went bankrupt, LTV and Baldwin-United\npublished yearend audits showing their book values to be $652\nmillion and $397 million, respectively.\nConversely, Belridge Oil\nwas sold to Shell in 1979 for $3.6 billion although its book\nvalue was only $177 million.\nAt Berkshire, however, the two valuations have tracked\nrather closely, with the growth rate in business value over the\nlast decade moderately outpacing the growth rate in book value.\nThis good news continued in 1987.\nOur premium of business value to book value has widened for\ntwo simple reasons: We own some remarkable businesses and they\nare run by even more remarkable managers.\nYou have a right to question that second assertion.\nAfter\nall, CEOs seldom tell their shareholders that they have assembled\na bunch of turkeys to run things.\nTheir reluctance to do so\nmakes for some strange annual reports.\nOftentimes, in his\nshareholders' letter, a CEO will go on for pages detailing\ncorporate performance that is woefully inadequate.\nHe will\nnonetheless end with a warm paragraph describing his managerial\ncomrades as \"our most precious asset.\" Such comments sometimes\nmake you wonder what the other assets can possibly be.\nAt Berkshire, however, my appraisal of our operating\nmanagers is, if anything, understated.\nTo understand why, first\ntake a look at page 7, where we show the earnings (on an\nhistorical-cost accounting basis) of our seven largest non-\nfinancial units:\nBuffalo News, Fechheimer, Kirby, Nebraska\nFurniture Mart, Scott Fetzer Manufacturing Group, See's Candies,\nand World Book.\nIn 1987, these seven business units had combined\noperating earnings before interest and taxes of $180 million.\nBy itself, this figure says nothing about economic\nperformance.\nTo evaluate that, we must know how much total\ncapital - debt and equity - was needed to produce these earnings.\nDebt plays an insignificant role at our seven units: Their net\ninterest expense in 1987 was only $2 million.\nThus, pre-tax\nearnings on the equity capital employed by these businesses\namounted to $178 million.\nAnd this equity - again on an\nhistorical-cost basis - was only $175 million.\nIf these seven business units had operated as a single\ncompany, their 1987 after-tax earnings would have been\napproximately $100 million - a return of about 57% on equity\ncapital.\nYou'll seldom see such a percentage anywhere, let alone\nat large, diversified companies with nominal leverage.\nHere's a\nbenchmark: In its 1988 Investor's Guide issue, Fortune reported\nthat among the 500 largest industrial companies and 500 largest\nservice companies, only six had averaged a return on equity of\nover 30% during the previous decade.\nThe best performer among\nthe 1000 was Commerce Clearing House at 40.2%.\nOf course, the returns that Berkshire earns from these seven\nunits are not as high as their underlying returns because, in\naggregate, we bought the businesses at a substantial premium to\nunderlying equity capital.\nOverall, these operations are carried\non our books at about $222 million above the historical\naccounting values of the underlying assets.\nHowever, the\nmanagers of the units should be judged by the returns they\nachieve on the underlying assets; what we pay for a business does\nnot affect the amount of capital its manager has to work with.\n(If, to become a shareholder and part owner of Commerce Clearing\nHouse, you pay, say, six times book value, that does not change\nCCH's return on equity.)\nThree important inferences can be drawn from the figures I\nhave cited.\nFirst, the current business value of these seven\nunits is far above their historical book value and also far above\nthe value at which they are carried on Berkshire's balance sheet.\nSecond, because so little capital is required to run these\nbusinesses, they can grow while concurrently making almost all of\ntheir earnings available for deployment in new opportunities.\nThird, these businesses are run by truly extraordinary managers.\nThe Blumkins, the Heldmans, Chuck Huggins, Stan Lipsey, and Ralph\nSchey all meld unusual talent, energy and character to achieve\nexceptional financial results.\nFor good reasons, we had very high expectations when we\njoined with these managers.\nIn every case, however, our\nexperience has greatly exceeded those expectations.\nWe have\nreceived far more than we deserve, but we are willing to accept\nsuch inequities. (We subscribe to the view Jack Benny expressed\nupon receiving an acting award: \"I don't deserve this, but then,\nI have arthritis and I don't deserve that either.\")\nBeyond the Sainted Seven, we have our other major unit,\ninsurance, which I believe also has a business value well above\nthe net assets employed in it.\nHowever, appraising the business\nvalue of a property-casualty insurance company is a decidedly\nimprecise process.\nThe industry is volatile, reported earnings\noftentimes are seriously inaccurate, and recent changes in the\nTax Code will severely hurt future profitability.\nDespite these\nproblems, we like the business and it will almost certainly\nremain our largest operation.\nUnder Mike Goldberg's management,\nthe insurance business should treat us well over time.\nWith managers like ours, my partner, Charlie Munger, and I\nhave little to do with operations. in fact, it is probably fair\nto say that if we did more, less would be accomplished.\nWe have\nno corporate meetings, no corporate budgets, and no performance\nreviews (though our managers, of course, oftentimes find such\nprocedures useful at their operating units).\nAfter all, what can\nwe tell the Blumkins about home furnishings, or the Heldmans\nabout uniforms?\nOur major contribution to the operations of our subsidiaries\nis applause.\nBut it is not the indiscriminate applause of a\nPollyanna.\nRather it is informed applause based upon the two\nlong careers we have spent intensively observing business\nperformance and managerial behavior.\nCharlie and I have seen so\nmuch of the ordinary in business that we can truly appreciate a\nvirtuoso performance.\nOnly one response to the 1987 performance\nof our operating managers is appropriate: sustained, deafening\napplause.\nSources of Reported Earnings\nThe table on the following page shows the major sources of\nBerkshire's reported earnings.\nIn the table, amortization of\nGoodwill and other major purchase-price accounting adjustments\nare not charged against the specific businesses to which they\napply but, instead, are aggregated and shown separately.\nIn\neffect, this procedure presents the earnings of our businesses as\nthey would have been reported had we not purchased them.\nIn\nappendixes to my letters in the 1983 and 1986 annual reports, I\nexplained why this form of presentation seems to us to be more\nuseful to investors and managers than the standard GAAP\npresentation, which makes purchase-price adjustments on a\nbusiness-by business basis.\nThe total net earnings we show in\nthe table are, of course, identical to the GAAP figures in our\naudited financial statements.\nIn the Business Segment Data on pages 36-38 and in the\nManagement's Discussion section on pages 40-44 you will find much\nadditional information about our businesses.\nIn these sections\nyou will also find our segment earnings reported on a GAAP basis.\nI urge you to read that material, as well as Charlie Munger's\nletter to Wesco shareholders, describing the various businesses\nof that subsidiary, which starts on page 45.\n(000s omitted)\n------------------------------------------\nBerkshire's Share\nof Net Earnings\n(after taxes and\nPre-Tax Earnings\nminority interests)\n-------------------\n-------------------\n1987\n1986\n1987\n1986\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nOperating Earnings:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting ............... $(55,429)\n$(55,844)\n$(20,696)\n$(29,864)\nNet Investment Income ......\n152,483\n107,143\n136,658\n96,440\nBuffalo News .................\n39,410\n34,736\n21,304\n16,918\nFechheimer (Acquired 6/3/86)\n13,332\n8,400\n6,580\n3,792\nKirby ........................\n22,408\n20,218\n12,891\n10,508\nNebraska Furniture Mart ......\n16,837\n17,685\n7,554\n7,192\nScott Fetzer Mfg.

(And it's about time:\nWith every\npassing year, this policy has seemed sillier to me.)\nNet sales of NFM were $142.6 million in 1987, up 8% from\n1986.\nThere's nothing like this store in the country, and\nthere's nothing like the family Mrs. B has produced to carry on:\nHer son Louie, and his three boys, Ron, Irv and Steve, possess\nthe business instincts, integrity and drive of Mrs. B. They work\nas a team and, strong as each is individually, the whole is far\ngreater than the sum of the parts.\nThe superb job done by the Blumkins benefits us as owners,\nbut even more dramatically benefits NFM's customers.\nThey saved\nabout $30 million in 1987 by buying from NFM.\nIn other words,\nthe goods they bought would have cost that much more if purchased\nelsewhere.\nYou'll enjoy an anonymous letter I received last August:\n\"Sorry to see Berkshire profits fall in the second quarter.\nOne\nway you may gain back part of your lost. (sic) Check the pricing\nat The Furniture Mart.\nYou will find that they are leaving 10%\nto 20% on the table.\nThis additional profit on $140 million of\nsells (sic) is $28 million.\nNot small change in anyone's pocket!\nCheck out other furniture, carpet, appliance and T.V. dealers.\nYour raising prices to a reasonable profit will help.\nThank you.\n/signed/ A Competitor.\"\nNFM will continue to grow and prosper by following Mrs. B's\nmaxim:\n\"Sell cheap and tell the truth.\"\no Among dominant papers of its size or larger, the Buffalo\nNews continues to be the national leader in two important ways:\n(1) its weekday and Sunday penetration rate (the percentage of\nhouseholds in the paper's primary market area that purchase it);\nand (2) its \"news-hole\" percentage (the portion of the paper\ndevoted to news).\nIt may not be coincidence that one newspaper leads in both\ncategories: an exceptionally \"newsrich\" product makes for broad\naudience appeal, which in turn leads to high penetration.\nOf\ncourse, quantity must be matched by quality.\nThis not only\nmeans good reporting and good writing; it means freshness and\nrelevance.\nTo be indispensable, a paper must promptly tell its\nreaders many things they want to know but won't otherwise learn\nuntil much later, if ever.\nAt the News, we put out seven fresh editions every 24 hours,\neach one extensively changed in content.\nHere's a small example\nthat may surprise you: We redo the obituary page in every edition\nof the News, or seven times a day.\nAny obituary added runs\nthrough the next six editions until the publishing cycle has been\ncompleted.\nIt's vital, of course, for a newspaper to cover national and\ninternational news well and in depth.\nBut it is also vital for\nit to do what only a local newspaper can: promptly and\nextensively chronicle the personally-important, otherwise-\nunreported details of community life.\nDoing this job well\nrequires a very broad range of news - and that means lots of\nspace, intelligently used.\nOur news hole was about 50% in 1987, just as it has been\nyear after year.\nIf we were to cut it to a more typical 40%, we\nwould save approximately $4 million annually in newsprint costs.\nThat interests us not at all - and it won't interest us even if,\nfor one reason or another, our profit margins should\nsignificantly shrink.\nCharlie and I do not believe in flexible operating budgets,\nas in \"Non-direct expenses can be X if revenues are Y, but must\nbe reduced if revenues are Y - 5%.\" Should we really cut our news\nhole at the Buffalo News, or the quality of product and service\nat See's, simply because profits are down during a given year or\nquarter?\nOr, conversely, should we add a staff economist, a\ncorporate strategist, an institutional advertising campaign or\nsomething else that does Berkshire no good simply because the\nmoney currently is rolling in?\nThat makes no sense to us.\nWe neither understand the adding\nof unneeded people or activities because profits are booming, nor\nthe cutting of essential people or activities because\nprofitability is shrinking.\nThat kind of yo-yo approach is\nneither business-like nor humane.\nOur goal is to do what makes\nsense for Berkshire's customers and employees at all times, and\nnever to add the unneeded. (\"But what about the corporate jet?\"\nyou rudely ask.\nWell, occasionally a man must rise above\nprinciple.)\nAlthough the News' revenues have grown only moderately since\n1984, superb management by Stan Lipsey, its publisher, has\nproduced excellent profit growth.\nFor several years, I have\nincorrectly predicted that profit margins at the News would fall.\nThis year I will not let vou down: Margins will, without\nquestion, shrink in 1988 and profit may fall as well.\nSkyrocketing newsprint costs will be the major cause.\no Fechheimer Bros. Company is another of our family\nbusinesses - and, like the Blumkins, what a family.\nThree\ngenerations of Heldmans have for decades consistently, built the\nsales and profits of this manufacturer and distributor of\nuniforms.\nIn the year that Berkshire acquired its controlling\ninterest in Fechheimer - 1986 - profits were a record.\nThe\nHeldmans didn't slow down after that.\nLast year earnings\nincreased substantially and the outlook is good for 1988.\nThere's nothing magic about the Uniform business; the only\nmagic is in the Heldmans.\nBob, George, Gary, Roger and Fred know\nthe business inside and out, and they have fun running it.\nWe\nare fortunate to be in partnership with them.\no Chuck Huggins continues to set new records at See's, just as\nhe has ever since we put him in charge on the day of our purchase\nsome 16 years ago.\nIn 1987, volume hit a new high at slightly\nUnder 25 million pounds.\nFor the second year in a row, moreover,\nsame-store sales, measured in pounds, were virtually unchanged.\nIn case you are wondering, that represents improvement: In each\nof the previous six years, same-store sales had fallen.\nAlthough we had a particularly strong 1986 Christmas season,\nwe racked up better store-for-store comparisons in the 1987\nChristmas season than at any other time of the year.\nThus, the\nseasonal factor at See's becomes even more extreme.\nIn 1987,\nabout 85% of our profit was earned during December.\nCandy stores are fun to visit, but most have not been fun\nfor their owners.\nFrom what we can learn, practically no one\nbesides See's has made significant profits in recent years from\nthe operation of candy shops.\nClearly, Chuck's record at See's\nis not due to a rising industry tide.\nRather, it is a one-of-a-\nkind performance.\nHis achievement requires an excellent product - which we\nhave - but it also requires genuine affection for the customer.\nChuck is 100% customer-oriented, and his attitude sets the tone\nfor the rest of the See's organization.\nHere's an example of Chuck in action: At See's we regularly\nadd new pieces of candy to our mix and also cull a few to keep\nour product line at about 100 varieties.\nLast spring we selected\n14 items for elimination.\nTwo, it turned out, were badly missed\nby our customers, who wasted no time in letting us know what they\nthought of our judgment: \"A pox on all in See's who participated\nin the abominable decision...;\" \"May your new truffles melt in\ntransit, may they sour in people's mouths, may your costs go up\nand your profits go down...;\" \"We are investigating the\npossibility of obtaining a mandatory injunction requiring you to\nsupply...;\" You get the picture.\nIn all, we received many hundreds of\nletters.\nChuck not only reintroduced the pieces, he turned this\nmiscue into an opportunity.\nEach person who had written got a\ncomplete and honest explanation in return.\nSaid Chuck's letter:\n\"Fortunately, when I make poor decisions, good things often\nhappen as a result...;\" And with the letter went a special gift\ncertificate.\nSee's increased prices only slightly in the last two years.\nIn 1988 we have raised prices somewhat more, though still\nmoderately.\nTo date, sales have been weak and it may be\ndifficult for See's to improve its earnings this year.\no World Book, Kirby, and the Scott Fetzer Manufacturing Group\nare all under the management of Ralph Schey.\nAnd what a lucky\nthing for us that they are.\nI told you last year that Scott\nFetzer performance in 1986 had far exceeded the expectations that\nCharlie and I had at the time of our purchase.\nResults in 1987\nwere even better.\nPre-tax earnings rose 10% while average\ncapital employed declined significantly.\nRalph's mastery of the 19 businesses for which he is\nresponsible is truly amazing, and he has also attracted some\noutstanding managers to run them.\nWe would love to find a few\nadditional units that could be put under Ralph's wing.\nThe businesses of Scott Fetzer are too numerous to describe\nin detail.\nLet's just update you on one of our favorites: At the\nend of 1987, World Book introduced its most dramatically-revised\nedition since 1962.\nThe number of color photos was increased\nfrom 14,000 to 24,000; over 6,000 articles were revised; 840 new\ncontributors were added.\nCharlie and I recommend this product to\nyou and your family, as we do World Book's products for younger\nchildren, Childcraft and Early World of Learning.\nIn 1987, World Book unit sales in the United States\nincreased for the fifth consecutive year.\nInternational sales\nand profits also grew substantially.\nThe outlook is good for\nScott Fetzer operations in aggregate, and for World Book in\nparticular.\nInsurance Operations\nShown below is an updated version of our usual table\npresenting key figures for the insurance industry:\nStatutory\nYearly Change\nCombined Ratio\nYearly Change\nInflation Rate\nin Premiums\nAfter Policyholder\nin Incurred\nMeasured by\nWritten (%)\nDividends\nLosses (%)\nGNP Deflator (%)\n-------------\n------------------\n-------------\n----------------\n1981 .....\n3.8\n106.0\n6.5\n9.6\n1982 .....\n4.4\n109.8\n8.4\n6.4\n1983 .....\n4.6\n112.0\n6.8\n3.8\n1984 .....\n9.2\n117.9\n16.9\n3.7\n1985 .....\n22.1\n116.3\n16.1\n3.2\n1986 (Rev.)\n22.2\n108.0\n13.5\n2.6\n1987 (Est.)\n8.7\n104.7\n6.8\n3.0\nSource:\nBest's Insurance Management Reports\nThe combined ratio represents total insurance costs (losses\nincurred plus expenses) compared to revenue from premiums: A\nratio below 100 indicates an underwriting profit, and one above\n100 indicates a loss.\nWhen the investment income that an insurer\nearns from holding on to policyholders' funds (\"the float\") is\ntaken into account, a combined ratio in the 107-111 range\ntypically produces an overall break-even result, exclusive of\nearnings on the funds provided by shareholders.\nThe math of the insurance business, encapsulated by the\ntable, is not very complicated.\nIn years when the industry's\nannual gain in revenues (premiums) pokes along at 4% or 5%,\nunderwriting losses are sure to mount.\nThat is not because auto\naccidents, fires, windstorms and the like are occurring more\nfrequently, nor has it lately been the fault of general\ninflation.\nToday, social and judicial inflation are the major\nculprits; the cost of entering a courtroom has simply ballooned.\nPart of the jump in cost arises from skyrocketing verdicts, and\npart from the tendency of judges and juries to expand the\ncoverage of insurance policies beyond that contemplated by the\ninsurer when the policies were written.\nSeeing no let-up in\neither trend, we continue to believe that the industry's revenues\nmust grow at about 10% annually for it to just hold its own in\nterms of profitability, even though general inflation may be\nrunning at a considerably lower rate.\nThe strong revenue gains of 1985-87 almost guaranteed the\nindustry an excellent underwriting performance in 1987 and,\nindeed, it was a banner year.\nBut the news soured as the\nquarters rolled by:\nBest's estimates that year-over-year volume\nincreases were 12.9%, 11.1%, 5.7%, and 5.6%. In 1988, the\nrevenue gain is certain to be far below our 10% \"equilibrium\"\nfigure.\nClearly, the party is over.\nHowever, earnings will not immediately sink.\nA lag factor\nexists in this industry: Because most policies are written for a\none-year term, higher or lower insurance prices do not have their\nfull impact on earnings until many months after they go into\neffect.\nThus, to resume our metaphor, when the party ends and\nthe bar is closed, you are allowed to finish your drink.\nIf\nresults are not hurt by a major natural catastrophe, we predict a\nsmall climb for the industry's combined ratio in 1988, followed\nby several years of larger increases.\nThe insurance industry is cursed with a set of dismal\neconomic characteristics that make for a poor long-term outlook:\nhundreds of competitors, ease of entry, and a product that cannot\nbe differentiated in any meaningful way.\nIn such a commodity-\nlike business, only a very low-cost operator or someone operating\nin a protected, and usually small, niche can sustain high\nprofitability levels.\nWhen shortages exist, however, even commodity businesses\nflourish.\nThe insurance industry enjoyed that kind of climate\nfor a while but it is now gone.\nOne of the ironies of capitalism\nis that most managers in commodity industries abhor shortage\nconditions - even though those are the only circumstances\npermitting them good returns.\nWhenever shortages appear, the\ntypical manager simply can't wait to expand capacity and thereby\nplug the hole through which money is showering upon him.\nThis is\nprecisely what insurance managers did in 1985-87, confirming\nagain Disraeli's observation: \"What we learn from history is that\nwe do not learn from history.\"\nAt Berkshire, we work to escape the industry's commodity\neconomics in two ways. First, we differentiate our product by our\nfinancial strength, which exceeds that of all others in the\nindustry.\nThis strength, however, is limited in its usefulness.\nIt means nothing in the personal insurance field:\nThe buyer of\nan auto or homeowners policy is going to get his claim paid even\nif his insurer fails (as many have).\nIt often means nothing in\nthe commercial insurance arena: When times are good, many major\ncorporate purchasers of insurance and their brokers pay scant\nattention to the insurer's ability to perform under the more\nadverse conditions that may exist, say, five years later when a\ncomplicated claim is finally resolved. (Out of sight, out of mind\n- and, later on, maybe out-of-pocket.)\nPeriodically, however, buyers remember Ben Franklin's\nobservation that it is hard for an empty sack to stand upright\nand recognize their need to buy promises only from insurers that\nhave enduring financial strength.\nIt is then that we have a\nmajor competitive advantage.\nWhen a buyer really focuses on\nwhether a $10 million claim can be easily paid by his insurer\nfive or ten years down the road, and when he takes into account\nthe possibility that poor underwriting conditions may then\ncoincide with depressed financial markets and defaults by\nreinsurer, he will find only a few companies he can trust.\nAmong those, Berkshire will lead the pack.\nOur second method of differentiating ourselves is the total\nindifference to volume that we maintain.\nIn 1989, we will be\nperfectly willing to write five times as much business as we\nwrite in 1988 - or only one-fifth as much.\nWe hope, of course,\nthat conditions will allow us large volume.\nBut we cannot\ncontrol market prices.\nIf they are unsatisfactory, we will\nsimply do very little business.\nNo other major insurer acts with\nequal restraint.\nThree conditions that prevail in insurance, but not in most\nbusinesses, allow us our flexibility.\nFirst, market share is not\nan important determinant of profitability: In this business, in\ncontrast to the newspaper or grocery businesses, the economic\nrule is not survival of the fattest.\nSecond, in many sectors of\ninsurance, including most of those in which we operate,\ndistribution channels are not proprietary and can be easily\nentered: Small volume this year does not preclude huge volume\nnext year.\nThird, idle capacity - which in this industry largely\nmeans people - does not result in intolerable costs.\nIn a way\nthat industries such as printing or steel cannot, we can operate\nat quarter-speed much of the time and still enjoy long-term\nprosperity.\nWe follow a price-based-on-exposure, not-on-competition\npolicy because it makes sense for our shareholders.\nBut we're\nhappy to report that it is also pro-social.\nThis policy means\nthat we are always available, given prices that we believe are\nadequate, to write huge volumes of almost any type of property-\ncasualty insurance.\nMany other insurers follow an in-and-out\napproach.\nWhen they are \"out\" - because of mounting losses,\ncapital inadequacy, or whatever - we are available.\nOf course,\nwhen others are panting to do business we are also available -\nbut at such times we often find ourselves priced above the\nmarket.\nIn effect, we supply insurance buyers and brokers with a\nlarge reservoir of standby capacity.\nOne story from mid-1987 illustrates some consequences of our\npricing policy:\nOne of the largest family-owned insurance\nbrokers in the country is headed by a fellow who has long been a\nshareholder of Berkshire.\nThis man handles a number of large\nrisks that are candidates for placement with our New York office.\nNaturally, he does the best he can for his clients.\nAnd, just as\nnaturally, when the insurance market softened dramatically in\n1987 he found prices at other insurers lower than we were willing\nto offer.\nHis reaction was, first, to place all of his business\nelsewhere and, second, to buy more stock in Berkshire.\nHad we\nbeen really competitive, he said, we would have gotten his\ninsurance business but he would not have bought our stock.\nBerkshire's underwriting experience was excellent in 1987,\nin part because of the lag factor discussed earlier.\nOur\ncombined ratio (on a statutory basis and excluding structured\nsettlements and financial reinsurance) was 105.\nAlthough the\nratio was somewhat less favorable than in 1986, when it was 103,\nour profitability improved materially in 1987 because we had the\nuse of far more float.\nThis trend will continue to run in our\nfavor: Our ratio of float to premium volume will increase very\nsignificantly during the next few years.\nThus, Berkshire's\ninsurance profits are quite likely to improve during 1988 and\n1989, even though we expect our combined ratio to rise.\nOur insurance business has also made some important non-\nfinancial gains during the last few years.\nMike Goldberg, its\nmanager, has assembled a group of talented professionals to write\nlarger risks and unusual coverages.\nHis operation is now well\nequipped to handle the lines of business that will occasionally\noffer us major opportunities.\nOur loss reserve development, detailed on pages 41-42, looks\nbetter this year than it has previously.\nBut we write lots of\n\"long-tail\" business - that is, policies generating claims that\noften take many years to resolve.\nExamples would be product\nliability, or directors and officers liability coverages.\nWith a\nbusiness mix like this, one year of reserve development tells you\nvery little.\nYou should be very suspicious of any earnings figures\nreported by insurers (including our own, as we have unfortunately\nproved to you in the past).\nThe record of the last decade shows\nthat a great many of our best-known insurers have reported\nearnings to shareholders that later proved to be wildly\nerroneous.\nIn most cases, these errors were totally innocent:\nThe unpredictability of our legal system makes it impossible for\neven the most conscientious insurer to come close to judging the\neventual cost of long-tail claims.\nNevertheless, auditors annually certify the numbers given\nthem by management and in their opinions unqualifiedly state that\nthese figures \"present fairly\" the financial position of their\nclients.\nThe auditors use this reassuring language even though\nthey know from long and painful experience that the numbers so\ncertified are likely to differ dramatically from the true\nearnings of the period.\nDespite this history of error, investors\nunderstandably rely upon auditors' opinions.\nAfter all, a\ndeclaration saying that \"the statements present fairly\" hardly\nsounds equivocal to the non-accountant.\nThe wording in the auditor's standard opinion letter is\nscheduled to change next year.\nThe new language represents\nimprovement, but falls far short of describing the limitations of\na casualty-insurer audit.\nIf it is to depict the true state of\naffairs, we believe the standard opinion letter to shareholders\nof a property-casualty company should read something like: \"We\nhave relied upon representations of management in respect to the\nliabilities shown for losses and loss adjustment expenses, the\nestimate of which, in turn, very materially affects the earnings\nand financial condition herein reported.\nWe can express no\nopinion about the accuracy of these figures.\nSubject to that\nimportant reservation, in our opinion, etc.\"\nIf lawsuits develop in respect to wildly inaccurate\nfinancial statements (which they do), auditors will definitely\nsay something of that sort in court anyway.\nWhy should they not\nbe forthright about their role and its limitations from the\noutset?\nWe want to emphasize that we are not faulting auditors for\ntheir inability to accurately assess loss reserves (and therefore\nearnings).\nWe fault them only for failing to publicly\nacknowledge that they can't do this job.\nFrom all appearances, the innocent mistakes that are\nconstantly made in reserving are accompanied by others that are\ndeliberate.\nVarious charlatans have enriched themselves at the\nexpense of the investing public by exploiting, first, the\ninability of auditors to evaluate reserve figures and, second,\nthe auditors' willingness to confidently certify those figures as\nif they had the expertise to do so.\nWe will continue to see such\nchicanery in the future.\nWhere \"earnings\" can be created by the\nstroke of a pen, the dishonest will gather.\nFor them, long-tail\ninsurance is heaven.\nThe audit wording we suggest would at least\nserve to put investors on guard against these predators.\nThe taxes that insurance companies pay - which increased\nmaterially, though on a delayed basis, upon enactment of the Tax\nReform Act of 1986 - took a further turn for the worse at the end\nof 1987.\nWe detailed the 1986 changes in last year's report.\nWe\nalso commented on the irony of a statute that substantially\nincreased 1987 reported earnings for insurers even as it\nmaterially reduced both their long-term earnings potential and\ntheir business value.\nAt Berkshire, the temporarily-helpful\n\"fresh start\" adjustment inflated 1987 earnings by $8.2 million.\nIn our opinion, the 1986 Act was the most important economic\nevent affecting the insurance industry over the past decade.\nThe\n1987 Bill further reduced the intercorporate dividends-received\ncredit from 80% to 70%, effective January 1, 1988, except for\ncases in which the taxpayer owns at least 20% of an investee.\nInvestors who have owned stocks or bonds through corporate\nintermediaries other than qualified investment companies have\nalways been disadvantaged in comparison to those owning the same\nsecurities directly.\nThe penalty applying to indirect ownership\nwas greatly increased by the 1986 Tax Bill and, to a lesser\nextent, by the 1987 Bill, particularly in instances where the\nintermediary is an insurance company.\nWe have no way of\noffsetting this increased level of taxation.\nIt simply means\nthat a given set of pre-tax investment returns will now translate\ninto much poorer after-tax results for our shareholders.\nAll in all, we expect to do well in the insurance business,\nthough our record is sure to be uneven.\nThe immediate outlook is\nfor substantially lower volume but reasonable earnings\nimprovement.\nThe decline in premium volume will accelerate after\nour quota-share agreement with Fireman's Fund expires in 1989.\nAt some point, likely to be at least a few years away, we may see\nsome major opportunities, for which we are now much better\nprepared than we were in 1985.\nMarketable Securities - Permanent Holdings\nWhenever Charlie and I buy common stocks for Berkshire's\ninsurance companies (leaving aside arbitrage purchases, discussed\nlater) we approach the transaction as if we were buying into a\nprivate business.\nWe look at the economic prospects of the\nbusiness, the people in charge of running it, and the price we\nmust pay.\nWe do not have in mind any time or price for sale.\nIndeed, we are willing to hold a stock indefinitely so long as we\nexpect the business to increase in intrinsic value at a\nsatisfactory rate.\nWhen investing, we view ourselves as business\nanalysts - not as market analysts, not as macroeconomic analysts,\nand not even as security analysts.\nOur approach makes an active trading market useful, since it\nperiodically presents us with mouth-watering opportunities.\nBut\nby no means is it essential: a prolonged suspension of trading in\nthe securities we hold would not bother us any more than does the\nlack of daily quotations on World Book or Fechheimer.\nEventually, our economic fate will be determined by the economic\nfate of the business we own, whether our ownership is partial or\ntotal.\nBen Graham, my friend and teacher, long ago described the\nmental attitude toward market fluctuations that I believe to be\nmost conducive to investment success.\nHe said that you should\nimagine market quotations as coming from a remarkably\naccommodating fellow named Mr. Market who is your partner in a\nprivate business.\nWithout fail, Mr. Market appears daily and\nnames a price at which he will either buy your interest or sell\nyou his.\nEven though the business that the two of you own may have\neconomic characteristics that are stable, Mr. Market's quotations\nwill be anything but.\nFor, sad to say, the poor fellow has\nincurable emotional problems.\nAt times he feels euphoric and can\nsee only the favorable factors affecting the business.\nWhen in\nthat mood, he names a very high buy-sell price because he fears\nthat you will snap up his interest and rob him of imminent gains.\nAt other times he is depressed and can see nothing but trouble\nahead for both the business and the world.\nOn these occasions he\nwill name a very low price, since he is terrified that you will\nunload your interest on him.\nMr. Market has another endearing characteristic: He doesn't\nmind being ignored.\nIf his quotation is uninteresting to you\ntoday, he will be back with a new one tomorrow.\nTransactions are\nstrictly at your option.\nUnder these conditions, the more manic-\ndepressive his behavior, the better for you.\nBut, like Cinderella at the ball, you must heed one warning\nor everything will turn into pumpkins and mice: Mr. Market is\nthere to serve you, not to guide you.\nIt is his pocketbook, not\nhis wisdom, that you will find useful.\nIf he shows up some day\nin a particularly foolish mood, you are free to either ignore him\nor to take advantage of him, but it will be disastrous if you\nfall under his influence.\nIndeed, if you aren't certain that you\nunderstand and can value your business far better than Mr.\nMarket, you don't belong in the game.\nAs they say in poker, \"If\nyou've been in the game 30 minutes and you don't know who the\npatsy is, you're the patsy.\"\nBen's Mr. Market allegory may seem out-of-date in today's\ninvestment world, in which most professionals and academicians\ntalk of efficient markets, dynamic hedging and betas.\nTheir\ninterest in such matters is understandable, since techniques\nshrouded in mystery clearly have value to the purveyor of\ninvestment advice.\nAfter all, what witch doctor has ever\nachieved fame and fortune by simply advising \"Take two aspirins\"?\nThe value of market esoterica to the consumer of investment\nadvice is a different story.\nIn my opinion, investment success\nwill not be produced by arcane formulae, computer programs or\nsignals flashed by the price behavior of stocks and markets.\nRather an investor will succeed by coupling good business\njudgment with an ability to insulate his thoughts and behavior\nfrom the super-contagious emotions that swirl about the\nmarketplace.\nIn my own efforts to stay insulated, I have found\nit highly useful to keep Ben's Mr. Market concept firmly in mind.\nFollowing Ben's teachings, Charlie and I let our marketable\nequities tell us by their operating results - not by their daily,\nor even yearly, price quotations - whether our investments are\nsuccessful.\nThe market may ignore business success for a while,\nbut eventually will confirm it.\nAs Ben said: \"In the short run,\nthe market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a\nweighing machine.\" The speed at which a business's success is\nrecognized, furthermore, is not that important as long as the\ncompany's intrinsic value is increasing at a satisfactory rate.\nIn fact, delayed recognition can be an advantage: It may give us\nthe chance to buy more of a good thing at a bargain price.\nSometimes, of course, the market may judge a business to be\nmore valuable than the underlying facts would indicate it is.\nIn\nsuch a case, we will sell our holdings.\nSometimes, also, we will\nsell a security that is fairly valued or even undervalued because\nwe require funds for a still more undervalued investment or one\nwe believe we understand better.\nWe need to emphasize, however, that we do not sell holdings\njust because they have appreciated or because we have held them\nfor a long time. (Of Wall Street maxims the most foolish may be\n\"You can't go broke taking a profit.\") We are quite content to\nhold any security indefinitely, so long as the prospective return\non equity capital of the underlying business is satisfactory,\nmanagement is competent and honest, and the market does not\novervalue the business.\nHowever, our insurance companies own three marketable common\nstocks that we would not sell even though they became far\noverpriced in the market.\nIn effect, we view these investments\nexactly like our successful controlled businesses - a permanent\npart of Berkshire rather than merchandise to be disposed of once\nMr. Market offers us a sufficiently high price.\nTo that, I will\nadd one qualifier: These stocks are held by our insurance\ncompanies and we would, if absolutely necessary, sell portions of\nour holdings to pay extraordinary insurance losses.\nWe intend,\nhowever, to manage our affairs so that sales are never required.\nA determination to have and to hold, which Charlie and I\nshare, obviously involves a mixture of personal and financial\nconsiderations.\nTo some, our stand may seem highly eccentric.\n(Charlie and I have long followed David Oglivy's advice: \"Develop\nyour eccentricities while you are young.\nThat way, when you get\nold, people won't think you're going ga-ga.\") Certainly, in the\ntransaction-fixated Wall Street of recent years, our posture must\nseem odd: To many in that arena, both companies and stocks are\nseen only as raw material for trades.\nOur attitude, however, fits our personalities and the way we\nwant to live our lives.\nChurchill once said, \"You shape your\nhouses and then they shape you.\" We know the manner in which we\nwish to be shaped.\nFor that reason, we would rather achieve a\nreturn of X while associating with people whom we strongly like\nand admire than realize 110% of X by exchanging these\nrelationships for uninteresting or unpleasant ones.\nAnd we will\nnever find people we like and admire more than some of the main\nparticipants at the three companies - our permanent holdings -\nshown below:\nNo. of Shares\nCost\nMarket\n-------------\n----------\n----------\n(000s omitted)\n3,000,000\nCapital Cities/ABC, Inc. ...........\n$517,500\n$1,035,000\n6,850,000\nGEICO Corporation ..................\n45,713\n756,925\n1,727,765\nThe Washington Post Company ........\n9,731\n323,092\nWe really don't see many fundamental differences between the\npurchase of a controlled business and the purchase of marketable\nholdings such as these.\nIn each case we try to buy into\nbusinesses with favorable long-term economics.\nOur goal is to\nfind an outstanding business at a sensible price, not a mediocre\nbusiness at a bargain price.\nCharlie and I have found that\nmaking silk purses out of silk is the best that we can do; with\nsow's ears, we fail.\n(It must be noted that your Chairman, always a quick study,\nrequired only 20 years to recognize how important it was to buy\ngood businesses.\nIn the interim, I searched for \"bargains\" - and\nhad the misfortune to find some.\nMy punishment was an education\nin the economics of short-line farm implement manufacturers,\nthird-place department stores, and New England textile\nmanufacturers.)\nOf course, Charlie and I may misread the fundamental\neconomics of a business.\nWhen that happens, we will encounter\nproblems whether that business is a wholly-owned subsidiary or a\nmarketable security, although it is usually far easier to exit\nfrom the latter. (Indeed, businesses can be misread:\nWitness the\nEuropean reporter who, after being sent to this country to\nprofile Andrew Carnegie, cabled his editor, \"My God, you'll never\nbelieve the sort of money there is in running libraries.\")\nIn making both control purchases and stock purchases, we try\nto buy not only good businesses, but ones run by high-grade,\ntalented and likeable managers.\nIf we make a mistake about the\nmanagers we link up with, the controlled company offers a certain\nadvantage because we have the power to effect change.\nIn\npractice, however, this advantage is somewhat illusory:\nManagement changes, like marital changes, are painful, time-\nconsuming and chancy.\nIn any event, at our three marketable-but\npermanent holdings, this point is moot:\nWith Tom Murphy and Dan\nBurke at Cap Cities, Bill Snyder and Lou Simpson at GEICO, and\nKay Graham and Dick Simmons at The Washington Post, we simply\ncouldn't be in better hands.\nI would say that the controlled company offers two main\nadvantages.\nFirst, when we control a company we get to allocate\ncapital, whereas we are likely to have little or nothing to say\nabout this process with marketable holdings.\nThis point can be\nimportant because the heads of many companies are not skilled in\ncapital allocation.\nTheir inadequacy is not surprising.\nMost\nbosses rise to the top because they have excelled in an area such\nas marketing, production, engineering, administration or,\nsometimes, institutional politics.\nOnce they become CEOs, they face new responsibilities.\nThey\nnow must make capital allocation decisions, a critical job that\nthey may have never tackled and that is not easily mastered.\nTo\nstretch the point, it's as if the final step for a highly-\ntalented musician was not to perform at Carnegie Hall but,\ninstead, to be named Chairman of the Federal Reserve.\nThe lack of skill that many CEOs have at capital allocation\nis no small matter: After ten years on the job, a CEO whose\ncompany annually retains earnings equal to 10% of net worth will\nhave been responsible for the deployment of more than 60% of all\nthe capital at work in the business.\nCEOs who recognize their lack of capital-allocation skills\n(which not all do) will often try to compensate by turning to\ntheir staffs, management consultants, or investment bankers.\nCharlie and I have frequently observed the consequences of such\n\"help.\" On balance, we feel it is more likely to accentuate the\ncapital-allocation problem than to solve it.\nIn the end, plenty of unintelligent capital allocation takes\nplace in corporate America. (That's why you hear so much about\n\"restructuring.\") Berkshire, however, has been fortunate.\nAt the\ncompanies that are our major non-controlled holdings, capital has\ngenerally been well-deployed and, in some cases, brilliantly so.\nThe second advantage of a controlled company over a\nmarketable security has to do with taxes.\nBerkshire, as a\ncorporate holder, absorbs some significant tax costs through the\nownership of partial positions that we do not when our ownership\nis 80%, or greater.\nSuch tax disadvantages have long been with\nus, but changes in the tax code caused them to increase\nsignificantly during the past year.\nAs a consequence, a given\nbusiness result can now deliver Berkshire financial results that\nare as much as 50% better if they come from an 80%-or-greater\nholding rather than from a lesser holding.\nThe disadvantages of owning marketable securities are\nsometimes offset by a huge advantage:\nOccasionally the stock\nmarket offers us the chance to buy non-controlling pieces of\nextraordinary businesses at truly ridiculous prices -\ndramatically below those commanded in negotiated transactions\nthat transfer control.\nFor example, we purchased our Washington\nPost stock in 1973 at $5.63 per share, and per-share operating\nearnings in 1987 after taxes were $10.30.\nSimilarly, Our GEICO\nstock was purchased in 1976, 1979 and 1980 at an average of $6.67\nper share, and after-tax operating earnings per share last year\nwere $9.01. In cases such as these, Mr. Market has proven to be a\nmighty good friend.\nAn interesting accounting irony overlays a comparison of the\nreported financial results of our controlled companies with those\nof the permanent minority holdings listed above.\nAs you can see,\nthose three stocks have a market value of over $2 billion.\nYet\nthey produced only $11 million in reported after-tax earnings for\nBerkshire in 1987.\nAccounting rules dictate that we take into income only the\ndividends these companies pay us - which are little more than\nnominal - rather than our share of their earnings, which in 1987\namounted to well over $100 million.\nOn the other hand,\naccounting rules provide that the carrying value of these three\nholdings - owned, as they are, by insurance companies - must be\nrecorded on our balance sheet at current market prices.\nThe\nresult: GAAP accounting lets us reflect in our net worth the up-\nto-date underlying values of the businesses we partially own, but\ndoes not let us reflect their underlying earnings in our income\naccount.\nIn the case of our controlled companies, just the opposite\nis true.\nHere, we show full earnings in our income account but\nnever change asset values on our balance sheet, no matter how\nmuch the value of a business might have increased since we\npurchased it.\nOur mental approach to this accounting schizophrenia is to\nignore GAAP figures and to focus solely on the future earning\npower of both our controlled and non-controlled businesses.\nUsing this approach, we establish our own ideas of business\nvalue, keeping these independent from both the accounting values\nshown on our books for controlled companies and the values placed\nby a sometimes foolish market on our partially-owned companies.\nIt is this business value that we hope to increase at a\nreasonable (or, preferably, unreasonable) rate in the years\nahead.\nMarketable Securities - Other\nIn addition to our three permanent common stock holdings, we\nhold large quantities of marketable securities in our insurance\ncompanies.\nIn selecting these, we can choose among five major\ncategories: (1) long-term common stock investments, (2) medium-\nterm fixed-income securities, (3) long-term fixed income\nsecurities, (4) short-term cash equivalents, and (5) short-term\narbitrage commitments.\nWe have no particular bias when it comes to choosing from\nthese categories.\nWe just continuously search among them for the\nhighest after-tax returns as measured by \"mathematical\nexpectation,\" limiting ourselves always to investment\nalternatives we think we understand.\nOur criteria have nothing\nto do with maximizing immediately reportable earnings; our goal,\nrather, is to maximize eventual net worth.\no Let's look first at common stocks.\nDuring 1987 the stock\nmarket was an area of much excitement but little net movement:\nThe Dow advanced 2.3% for the year.\nYou are aware, of course, of\nthe roller coaster ride that produced this minor change.\nMr.\nMarket was on a manic rampage until October and then experienced\na sudden, massive seizure.\nWe have \"professional\" investors, those who manage many\nbillions, to thank for most of this turmoil.\nInstead of focusing\non what businesses will do in the years ahead, many prestigious\nmoney managers now focus on what they expect other money managers\nto do in the days ahead.\nFor them, stocks are merely tokens in a\ngame, like the thimble and flatiron in Monopoly.\nAn extreme example of what their attitude leads to is\n\"portfolio insurance,\" a money-management strategy that many\nleading investment advisors embraced in 1986-1987.\nThis strategy\n- which is simply an exotically-labeled version of the small\nspeculator's stop-loss order dictates that ever increasing\nportions of a stock portfolio, or their index-future equivalents,\nbe sold as prices decline.\nThe strategy says nothing else\nmatters: A downtick of a given magnitude automatically produces a\nhuge sell order.\nAccording to the Brady Report, $60 billion to\n$90 billion of equities were poised on this hair trigger in mid-\nOctober of 1987.\nIf you've thought that investment advisors were hired to\ninvest, you may be bewildered by this technique.\nAfter buying a\nfarm, would a rational owner next order his real estate agent to\nstart selling off pieces of it whenever a neighboring property\nwas sold at a lower price?\nOr would you sell your house to\nwhatever bidder was available at 9:31 on some morning merely\nbecause at 9:30 a similar house sold for less than it would have\nbrought on the previous day?\nMoves like that, however, are what portfolio insurance tells\na pension fund or university to make when it owns a portion of\nenterprises such as Ford or General Electric.\nThe less these\ncompanies are being valued at, says this approach, the more\nvigorously they should be sold.\nAs a \"logical\" corollary, the\napproach commands the institutions to repurchase these companies\n- I'm not making this up - once their prices have rebounded\nsignificantly.\nConsidering that huge sums are controlled by\nmanagers following such Alice-in-Wonderland practices, is it any\nsurprise that markets sometimes behave in aberrational fashion?\nMany commentators, however, have drawn an incorrect\nconclusion upon observing recent events: They are fond of saying\nthat the small investor has no chance in a market now dominated\nby the erratic behavior of the big boys.\nThis conclusion is dead\nwrong: Such markets are ideal for any investor - small or large -\nso long as he sticks to his investment knitting.\nVolatility\ncaused by money managers who speculate irrationally with huge\nsums will offer the true investor more chances to make\nintelligent investment moves.\nHe can be hurt by such volatility\nonly if he is forced, by either financial or psychological\npressures, to sell at untoward times.\nAt Berkshire, we have found little to do in stocks during\nthe past few years.\nDuring the break in October, a few stocks\nfell to prices that interested us, but we were unable to make\nmeaningful purchases before they rebounded.\nAt yearend 1987 we\nhad no major common stock investments (that is, over $50 million)\nother than those we consider permanent or arbitrage holdings.\nHowever, Mr. Market will offer us opportunities - you can be sure\nof that - and, when he does, we will be willing and able to\nparticipate.\no In the meantime, our major parking place for money is\nmedium-term tax-exempt bonds, whose limited virtues I explained\nin last year's annual report.\nThough we both bought and sold\nsome of these bonds in 1987, our position changed little overall,\nholding around $900 million.\nA large portion of our bonds are\n\"grandfathered\" under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which means\nthey are fully tax-exempt.\nBonds currently purchased by\ninsurance companies are not.\nAs an alternative to short-term cash equivalents, our\nmedium-term tax-exempts have - so far served us well.\nThey have\nproduced substantial extra income for us and are currently worth\na bit above our cost.\nRegardless of their market price, we are\nready to dispose of our bonds whenever something better comes\nalong.\no We continue to have an aversion to long-term bonds (and may\nbe making a serious mistake by not disliking medium-term bonds as\nwell).\nBonds are no better than the currency in which they are\ndenominated, and nothing we have seen in the past year - or past\ndecade - makes us enthusiastic about the long-term future of U.S.\ncurrency.\nOur enormous trade deficit is causing various forms of\n\"claim checks\" - U.S. government and corporate bonds, bank\ndeposits, etc. - to pile up in the hands of foreigners at a\ndistressing rate.\nBy default, our government has adopted an\napproach to its finances patterned on that of Blanche DuBois, of\nA Streetcar Named Desire, who said, \"I have always depended on\nthe kindness of strangers.\" In this case, of course, the\n\"strangers\" are relying on the integrity of our claim checks\nalthough the plunging dollar has already made that proposition\nexpensive for them.\nThe faith that foreigners are placing in us may be\nmisfounded.\nWhen the claim checks outstanding grow sufficiently\nnumerous and when the issuing party can unilaterally determine\ntheir purchasing power, the pressure on the issuer to dilute\ntheir value by inflating the currency becomes almost\nirresistible.\nFor the debtor government, the weapon of inflation\nis the economic equivalent of the \"H\" bomb, and that is why very\nfew countries have been allowed to swamp the world with debt\ndenominated in their own currency.\nOur past, relatively good\nrecord for fiscal integrity has let us break this rule, but the\ngenerosity accorded us is likely to intensify, rather than\nrelieve, the eventual pressure on us to inflate.\nIf we do\nsuccumb to that pressure, it won't be just the foreign holders of\nour claim checks who will suffer.\nIt will be all of us as well.\nOf course, the U.S. may take steps to stem our trade deficit\nwell before our position as a net debtor gets out of hand. (In\nthat respect, the falling dollar will help, though unfortunately\nit will hurt in other ways.) Nevertheless, our government's\nbehavior in this test of its mettle is apt to be consistent with\nits Scarlett O'Hara approach generally: \"I'll think about it\ntomorrow.\" And, almost inevitably, procrastination in facing up\nto fiscal problems will have inflationary consequences.\nBoth the timing and the sweep of those consequences are\nunpredictable.\nBut our inability to quantify or time the risk\ndoes not mean we should ignore it.\nWhile recognizing the\npossibility that we may be wrong and that present interest rates\nmay adequately compensate for the inflationary risk, we retain a\ngeneral fear of long-term bonds.\nWe are, however, willing to invest a moderate portion of our\nfunds in this category if we think we have a significant edge in\na specific security.\nThat willingness explains our holdings of\nthe Washington Public Power Supply Systems #1, #2 and #3 issues,\ndiscussed in our 1984 report.\nWe added to our WPPSS position\nduring 1987.\nAt yearend, we had holdings with an amortized cost\nof $240 million and a market value of $316 million, paying us\ntax-exempt income of $34 million annually.\no We continued to do well in arbitrage last year, though - or\nperhaps because - we operated on a very limited scale.\nWe enter\ninto only a few arbitrage commitments each year and restrict\nourselves to large transactions that have been publicly\nannounced.\nWe do not participate in situations in which green-\nmailers are attempting to put a target company \"in play.\"\nWe have practiced arbitrage on an opportunistic basis for\ndecades and, to date, our results have been quite good.\nThough\nwe've never made an exact calculation, I believe that overall we\nhave averaged annual pre-tax returns of at least 25% from\narbitrage.\nI'm quite sure we did better than that in 1987.\nBut\nit should be emphasized that a really bad experience or two -\nsuch as many arbitrage operations suffered in late 1987 - could\nchange the figures dramatically.\nOur only $50 million-plus arbitrage position at yearend 1987\nwas 1,096,200 shares of Allegis, with a cost of $76 million and a\nmarket value of $78 million.\no We had two other large holdings at yearend that do not fit\nprecisely into any of our five categories.\nOne was various\nTexaco, Inc. bonds with short maturities, all purchased after\nTexaco went into bankruptcy.\nWere it not for the extraordinarily\nstrong capital position of our insurance companies, it would be\ninappropriate for us to buy defaulted bonds.\nAt prices\nprevailing after Texaco's bankruptcy filing, however, we regarded\nthese issues as by far the most attractive bond investment\navailable to us.\nOn a worst-case basis with respect to the Pennzoil\nlitigation, we felt the bonds were likely to be worth about what\nwe paid for them.\nGiven a sensible settlement, which seemed\nlikely, we expected the bonds to be worth considerably more.\nAt\nyearend our Texaco bonds were carried on our books at $104\nmillion and had a market value of $119 million.\nBy far our largest - and most publicized - investment in\n1987 was a $700 million purchase of Salomon Inc 9% preferred\nstock.\nThis preferred is convertible after three years into\nSalomon common stock at $38 per share and, if not converted, will\nbe redeemed ratably over five years beginning October 31, 1995.\nFrom most standpoints, this commitment fits into the medium-term\nfixed-income securities category.\nIn addition, we have an\ninteresting conversion possibility.\nWe, of course, have no special insights regarding the\ndirection or future profitability of investment banking.\nBy\ntheir nature, the economics of this industry are far less\npredictable than those of most other industries in which we have\nmajor Commitments.\nThis unpredictability is one of the reasons\nwhy our participation is in the form of a convertible preferred.\nWhat we do have a strong feeling about is the ability and\nintegrity of John Gutfreund, CEO of Salomon Inc.\nCharlie and I\nlike, admire and trust John.\nWe first got to know him in 1976\nwhen he played a key role in GEICO's escape from near-bankruptcy.\nSeveral times since, we have seen John steer clients away from\ntransactions that would have been unwise, but that the client\nclearly wanted to make - even though his advice provided no fee\nto Salomon and acquiescence would have delivered a large fee.\nSuch service-above-self behavior is far from automatic in Wall\nStreet.\nFor the reasons Charlie outlines on page 50, at yearend we\nvalued our Salomon investment at 98% of par, $14 million less\nthan our cost.\nHowever, we believe there is a reasonable\nlikelihood that a leading, high-quality capital-raising and\nmarket-making operation can average good returns on equity.\nIf\nso, our conversion right will eventually prove to be valuable.\nTwo further comments about our investments in marketable\nsecurities are appropriate.\nFirst, we give you our usual\nwarning: Our holdings have changed since yearend and will\ncontinue to do so without notice.\nThe second comment is related: During 1987, as in some\nearlier years, there was speculation in the press from time to\ntime about our purchase or sale of various securities.\nThese\nstories were sometimes true, sometimes partially true, and other\ntimes completely untrue.\nInterestingly, there has been no\ncorrelation between the size and prestige of the publication and\nthe accuracy of the report.\nOne dead-wrong rumor was given\nconsiderable prominence by a major national magazine, and another\nleading publication misled its readers by writing about an\narbitrage position as if it were a long-term investment\ncommitment. (In not naming names, I am observing the old warning\nthat it's not wise to pick fights with people who buy ink by the\nbarrel.)\nYou should understand that we simply don't comment in any\nway on rumors, whether they are true or false.\nIf we were to\ndeny the incorrect reports and refuse comment on the correct\nones, we would in effect be commenting on all.\nIn a world in which big investment ideas are both limited\nand valuable, we have no interest in telling potential\ncompetitors what we are doing except to the extent required by\nlaw.\nWe certainly don't expect others to tell us of their\ninvestment ideas.\nNor would we expect a media company to\ndisclose news of acquisitions it was privately pursuing or a\njournalist to tell his competitors about stories on which he is\nworking or sources he is using.\nI find it uncomfortable when friends or acquaintances\nmention that they are buying X because it has been reported -\nincorrectly - that Berkshire is a buyer.\nHowever, I do not set\nthem straight.\nIf they want to participate in whatever Berkshire\nactually is buying, they can always purchase Berkshire stock.\nBut perhaps that is too simple.\nUsually, I suspect, they find it\nmore exciting to buy what is being talked about.\nWhether that\nstrategy is more profitable is another question.\nFinancing\nShortly after yearend, Berkshire sold two issues of\ndebentures, totaling $250 million.\nBoth issues mature in 2018\nand will be retired at an even pace through sinking fund\noperations that begin in 1999.\nOur overall interest cost, after\nallowing for expenses of issuance, is slightly over 10%.\nSalomon\nwas our investment banker, and its service was excellent.\nDespite our pessimistic views about inflation, our taste for\ndebt is quite limited.\nTo be sure, it is likely that Berkshire\ncould improve its return on equity by moving to a much higher,\nthough still conventional, debt-to-business-value ratio.\nIt's\neven more likely that we could handle such a ratio, without\nproblems, under economic conditions far worse than any that have\nprevailed since the early 1930s.\nBut we do not wish it to be only likely that we can meet our\nobligations; we wish that to be certain.\nThus we adhere to\npolicies - both in regard to debt and all other matters - that\nwill allow us to achieve acceptable long-term results under\nextraordinarily adverse conditions, rather than optimal results\nunder a normal range of conditions.\nGood business or investment decisions will eventually\nproduce quite satisfactory economic results, with no aid from\nleverage.\nTherefore, it seems to us to be both foolish and\nimproper to risk what is important (including, necessarily, the\nwelfare of innocent bystanders such as policyholders and\nemployees) for some extra returns that are relatively\nunimportant.\nThis view is not the product of either our\nadvancing age or prosperity: Our opinions about debt have\nremained constant.\nHowever, we are not phobic about borrowing. (We're far from\nbelieving that there is no fate worse than debt.) We are willing\nto borrow an amount that we believe - on a worst-case basis -\nwill pose no threat to Berkshire's well-being.\nAnalyzing what\nthat amount might be, we can look to some important strengths\nthat would serve us well if major problems should engulf our\neconomy: Berkshire's earnings come from many diverse and well-\nentrenched businesses; these businesses seldom require much\ncapital investment; what debt we have is structured well; and we\nmaintain major holdings of liquid assets.\nClearly, we could be\ncomfortable with a higher debt-to-business-value ratio than we\nnow have.\nOne further aspect of our debt policy deserves comment:\nUnlike many in the business world, we prefer to finance in\nanticipation of need rather than in reaction to it.\nA business\nobtains the best financial results possible by managing both\nsides of its balance sheet well.\nThis means obtaining the\nhighest-possible return on assets and the lowest-possible cost on\nliabilities.\nIt would be convenient if opportunities for\nintelligent action on both fronts coincided.\nHowever, reason\ntells us that just the opposite is likely to be the case: Tight\nmoney conditions, which translate into high costs for\nliabilities, will create the best opportunities for acquisitions,\nand cheap money will cause assets to be bid to the sky.\nOur\nconclusion:\nAction on the liability side should sometimes be\ntaken independent of any action on the asset side.\nAlas, what is \"tight\" and \"cheap\" money is far from clear at\nany particular time.\nWe have no ability to forecast interest\nrates and - maintaining our usual open-minded spirit - believe\nthat no one else can.\nTherefore, we simply borrow when\nconditions seem non-oppressive and hope that we will later find\nintelligent expansion or acquisition opportunities, which - as we\nhave said - are most likely to pop up when conditions in the debt\nmarket are clearly oppressive.\nOur basic principle is that if\nyou want to shoot rare, fast-moving elephants, you should always\ncarry a loaded gun.\nOur fund-first, buy-or-expand-later policy almost always\npenalizes near-term earnings.\nFor example, we are now earning\nabout 6 1/2% on the $250 million we recently raised at 10%, a\ndisparity that is currently costing us about $160,000 per week.\nThis negative spread is unimportant to us and will not cause us\nto stretch for either acquisitions or higher-yielding short-term\ninstruments.\nIf we find the right sort of business elephant\nwithin the next five years or so, the wait will have been\nworthwhile.\nMiscellaneous\nWe hope to buy more businesses that are similar to the ones\nwe have, and we can use some help.\nIf you have a business that\nfits the following criteria, call me or, preferably, write.\nHere's what we're looking for:\n(1) large purchases (at least $10 million of after-tax\nearnings),\n(2) demonstrated consistent earning power (future\nprojections are of little interest to us, nor are\n\"turnaround\" situations),\n(3) businesses earning good returns on equity while\nemploying little or no debt,\n(4) management in place (we can't supply it),\n(5) simple businesses (if there's lots of technology,\nwe won't understand it),\n(6) an offering price (we don't want to waste our time\nor that of the seller by talking, even preliminarily,\nabout a transaction when price is unknown).\nWe will not engage in unfriendly takeovers.\nWe can promise\ncomplete confidentiality and a very fast answer - customarily\nwithin five minutes - as to whether we're interested.\nWe prefer\nto buy for cash, but will consider issuing stock when we receive\nas much in intrinsic business value as we give.\nWe invite\npotential sellers to check us out by contacting people with whom\nwe have done business in the past.\nFor the right business - and\nthe right people - we can provide a good home.\nOn the other hand, we frequently get approached about\nacquisitions that don't come close to meeting our tests: new\nventures, turnarounds, auction-like sales, and the ever-popular\n(among brokers) \"I'm-sure-something-will-work-out-if-you-people-\nget-to-know-each-other.\" None of these attracts us in the least.\nBesides being interested in the purchases of entire\nbusinesses as described above, we are also interested in the\nnegotiated purchase of large, but not controlling, blocks of\nstock comparable to those we hold in Cap Cities and Salomon.\nWe\nhave a special interest in purchasing convertible preferreds as a\nlong-term investment, as we did at Salomon.\n*\n*\n*\nAnd now a bit of deja vu.\nMost of Berkshire's major\nstockholders received their shares at yearend 1969 in a\nliquidating distribution from Buffett Partnership, Ltd.\nSome of\nthese former partners will remember that in 1962 I encountered\nsevere managerial problems at Dempster Mill Manufacturing Co., a\npump and farm implement manufacturing company that BPL\ncontrolled.\nAt that time, like now, I went to Charlie with problems that\nwere too tough for me to solve.\nCharlie suggested the solution\nmight lie in a California friend of his, Harry Bottle, whose\nspecial knack was never forgetting the fundamental.\nI met Harry\nin Los Angeles on April 17, 1962, and on April 23 he was in\nBeatrice, Nebraska, running Dempster.\nOur problems disappeared\nalmost immediately.\nIn my 1962 annual letter to partners, I\nnamed Harry \"Man of the Year.\"\nFade to 24 years later: The scene is K & W Products, a small\nBerkshire subsidiary that produces automotive compounds.\nFor\nyears K & W did well, but in 1985-86 it stumbled badly, as it\npursued the unattainable to the neglect of the achievable.\nCharlie, who oversees K & W, knew there was no need to consult\nme.\nInstead, he called Harry, now 68 years old, made him CEO,\nand sat back to await the inevitable.\nHe didn't wait long.\nIn\n1987 K & W's profits set a record, up more than 300% from 1986.\nAnd, as profits went up, capital employed went down: K & W's\ninvestment in accounts receivable and inventories has decreased\n20%.\nIf we run into another managerial problem ten or twenty\nyears down the road, you know whose phone will ring.\n*\n*\n*\nAbout 97.2% of all eligible shares participated in\nBerkshire's 1987 shareholder-designated contributions program.\nContributions made through the program were $4.9 million, and\n2,050 charities were recipients.\nA recent survey reported that about 50% of major American\ncompanies match charitable contributions made by directors\n(sometimes by a factor of three to one).\nIn effect, these\nrepresentatives of the owners direct funds to their favorite\ncharities, and never consult the owners as to their charitable\npreferences. (I wonder how they would feel if the process were\nreversed and shareholders could invade the directors' pockets for\ncharities favored by the shareholders.) When A takes money from B\nto give to C and A is a legislator, the process is called\ntaxation.\nBut when A is an officer or director of a corporation,\nit is called philanthropy.\nWe continue to believe that\ncontributions, aside from those with quite clear direct benefits\nto the company, should reflect the charitable preferences of\nowners rather than those of officers and directors.\nWe urge new shareholders to read the description of our\nshareholder-designated contributions program that appears on\npages 54 and 55.\nIf you wish to participate in future programs,\nwe strongly urge that you immediately make sure your shares are\nregistered in the name of the actual owner, not in \"street\" name\nor nominee name.\nShares not so registered on September 30, l988\nwill be ineligible for the 1988 program.\n*\n*\n*\nLast year we again had about 450 shareholders at our annual\nmeeting.\nThe 60 or so questions they asked were, as always,\nexcellent.\nAt many companies, the annual meeting is a waste of\ntime because exhibitionists turn it into a sideshow.\nOurs,\nhowever, is different.\nIt is informative for shareholders and\nfun for us. (At Berkshire's meetings, the exhibitionists are on\nthe dais.)\nThis year our meeting will be on May 23, 1988 in Omaha, and\nwe hope that you come.\nThe meeting provides the forum for you to\nask any owner-related questions you may have, and we will keep\nanswering until all (except those dealing with portfolio\nactivities or other proprietary information) have been dealt\nwith.\nLast year we rented two buses - for $100 - to take\nshareholders interested in the trip to the Furniture Mart.\nYour\nactions demonstrated your good judgment: You snapped up about\n$40,000 of bargains.\nMrs. B regards this expense/sales ratio as\non the high side and attributes it to my chronic inattention to\ncosts and generally sloppy managerial practices.\nBut, gracious\nas always, she has offered me another chance and we will again\nhave buses available following the meeting.\nMrs. B says you must\nbeat last year's sales figures, and I have told her she won't be\ndisappointed.\nWarren E.

    "text": "Chairman's Letter - 1988\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOur gain in net worth during 1988 was $569 million, or\n20.0%.\nOver the last 24 years (that is, since present management\ntook over), our per-share book value has grown from $19.46 to\n$2,974.52, or at a rate of 23.0% compounded annually.\nWeve emphasized in past reports that what counts, however,\nis intrinsic business value - the figure, necessarily an\nestimate, indicating what all of our constituent businesses are\nworth.\nBy our calculations, Berkshires intrinsic business value\nsignificantly exceeds its book value.\nOver the 24 years,\nbusiness value has grown somewhat faster than book value; in\n1988, however, book value grew the faster, by a bit.\nBerkshires past rates of gain in both book value and\nbusiness value were achieved under circumstances far different\nfrom those that now exist.\nAnyone ignoring these differences\nmakes the same mistake that a baseball manager would were he to\njudge the future prospects of a 42-year-old center fielder on the\nbasis of his lifetime batting average.\nImportant negatives affecting our prospects today are: (1) a\nless attractive stock market than generally existed over the past\n24 years; (2) higher corporate tax rates on most forms of\ninvestment income; (3) a far more richly-priced market for the\nacquisition of businesses; and (4) industry conditions for\nCapital Cities/ABC, Inc., GEICO Corporation, and The Washington\nPost Company - Berkshires three permanent investments,\nconstituting about one-half of our net worth - that range from\nslightly to materially less favorable than those existing five to\nten years ago.\nAll of these companies have superb management and\nstrong properties.\nBut, at current prices, their upside\npotential looks considerably less exciting to us today than it\ndid some years ago.\nThe major problem we face, however, is a growing capital\nbase.\nYouve heard that from us before, but this problem, like\nage, grows in significance each year. (And also, just as with\nage, its better to have this problem continue to grow rather\nthan to have it solved.)\nFour years ago I told you that we needed profits of $3.9\nbillion to achieve a 15% annual return over the decade then\nahead.\nToday, for the next decade, a 15% return demands profits\nof $10.3 billion.\nThat seems like a very big number to me and to\nCharlie Munger, Berkshires Vice Chairman and my partner. (Should\nthat number indeed prove too big, Charlie will find himself, in\nfuture reports, retrospectively identified as the senior\npartner.)\nAs a partial offset to the drag that our growing capital\nbase exerts upon returns, we have a very important advantage now\nthat we lacked 24 years ago.\nThen, all our capital was tied up\nin a textile business with inescapably poor economic\ncharacteristics.\nToday part of our capital is invested in some\nreally exceptional businesses.\nLast year we dubbed these operations the Sainted Seven:\nBuffalo News, Fechheimer, Kirby, Nebraska Furniture Mart, Scott\nFetzer Manufacturing Group, Sees, and World Book.\nIn 1988 the\nSaints came marching in.\nYou can see just how extraordinary\ntheir returns on capital were by examining the historical-cost\nfinancial statements on page 45, which combine the figures of the\nSainted Seven with those of several smaller units.\nWith no\nbenefit from financial leverage, this group earned about 67% on\naverage equity capital.\nIn most cases the remarkable performance of these units\narises partially from an exceptional business franchise; in all\ncases an exceptional management is a vital factor.\nThe\ncontribution Charlie and I make is to leave these managers alone.\nIn my judgment, these businesses, in aggregate, will\ncontinue to produce superb returns.\nWell need these: Without\nthis help Berkshire would not have a chance of achieving our 15%\ngoal.\nYou can be sure that our operating managers will deliver;\nthe question mark in our future is whether Charlie and I can\neffectively employ the funds that they generate.\nIn that respect, we took a step in the right direction early\nin 1989 when we purchased an 80% interest in Borsheims, a\njewelry business in Omaha.\nThis purchase, described later in\nthis letter, delivers exactly what we look for: an outstanding\nbusiness run by people we like, admire, and trust.\nIts a great\nway to start the year.\nAccounting Changes\nWe have made a significant accounting change that was\nmandated for 1988, and likely will have another to make in 1990.\nWhen we move figures around from year to year, without any change\nin economic reality, one of our always-thrilling discussions of\naccounting is necessary.\nFirst, Ill offer my customary disclaimer: Despite the\nshortcomings of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),\nI would hate to have the job of devising a better set of rules.\nThe limitations of the existing set, however, need not be\ninhibiting: CEOs are free to treat GAAP statements as a beginning\nrather than an end to their obligation to inform owners and\ncreditors - and indeed they should.\nAfter all, any manager of a\nsubsidiary company would find himself in hot water if he reported\nbarebones GAAP numbers that omitted key information needed by his\nboss, the parent corporations CEO.\nWhy, then, should the CEO\nhimself withhold information vitally useful to his bosses - the\nshareholder-owners of the corporation?\nWhat needs to be reported is data - whether GAAP, non-GAAP,\nor extra-GAAP - that helps financially-literate readers answer\nthree key questions: (1) Approximately how much is this company\nworth?\n(2) What is the likelihood that it can meet its future\nobligations? and (3) How good a job are its managers doing, given\nthe hand they have been dealt?\nIn most cases, answers to one or more of these questions are\nsomewhere between difficult and impossible to glean from the\nminimum GAAP presentation.\nThe business world is simply too\ncomplex for a single set of rules to effectively describe\neconomic reality for all enterprises, particularly those\noperating in a wide variety of businesses, such as Berkshire.\nFurther complicating the problem is the fact that many\nmanagements view GAAP not as a standard to be met, but as an\nobstacle to overcome.\nToo often their accountants willingly\nassist them. (How much, says the client, is two plus two?\nReplies the cooperative accountant, What number did you have in\nmind?) Even honest and well-intentioned managements sometimes\nstretch GAAP a bit in order to present figures they think will\nmore appropriately describe their performance.\nBoth the\nsmoothing of earnings and the big bath quarter are white lie\ntechniques employed by otherwise upright managements.\nThen there are managers who actively use GAAP to deceive and\ndefraud.\nThey know that many investors and creditors accept GAAP\nresults as gospel.\nSo these charlatans interpret the rules\nimaginatively and record business transactions in ways that\ntechnically comply with GAAP but actually display an economic\nillusion to the world.\nAs long as investors - including supposedly sophisticated\ninstitutions - place fancy valuations on reported earnings that\nmarch steadily upward, you can be sure that some managers and\npromoters will exploit GAAP to produce such numbers, no matter\nwhat the truth may be.\nOver the years, Charlie and I have\nobserved many accounting-based frauds of staggering size.\nFew of\nthe perpetrators have been punished; many have not even been\ncensured.\nIt has been far safer to steal large sums with a pen\nthan small sums with a gun.\nUnder one major change mandated by GAAP for 1988, we have\nbeen required to fully consolidate all our subsidiaries in our\nbalance sheet and earnings statement.\nIn the past, Mutual\nSavings and Loan, and Scott Fetzer Financial (a credit company\nthat primarily finances installment sales of World Book and Kirby\nproducts) were consolidated on a one-line basis.\nThat meant we\n(1) showed our equity in their combined net worths as a single-\nentry asset on Berkshires consolidated balance sheet and (2)\nincluded our equity in their combined annual earnings as a\nsingle-line income entry in our consolidated statement of\nearnings.\nNow the rules require that we consolidate each asset\nand liability of these companies in our balance sheet and each\nitem of their income and expense in our earnings statement.\nThis change underscores the need for companies also to\nreport segmented data: The greater the number of economically\ndiverse business operations lumped together in conventional\nfinancial statements, the less useful those presentations are and\nthe less able investors are to answer the three questions posed\nearlier.\nIndeed, the only reason we ever prepare consolidated\nfigures at Berkshire is to meet outside requirements.\nOn the\nother hand, Charlie and I constantly study our segment data.\nNow that we are required to bundle more numbers in our GAAP\nstatements, we have decided to publish additional supplementary\ninformation that we think will help you measure both business\nvalue and managerial performance. (Berkshires ability to\ndischarge its obligations to creditors - the third question we\nlisted - should be obvious, whatever statements you examine.) In\nthese supplementary presentations, we will not necessarily follow\nGAAP procedures, or even corporate structure.\nRather, we will\nattempt to lump major business activities in ways that aid\nanalysis but do not swamp you with detail.\nOur goal is to give\nyou important information in a form that we would wish to get it\nif our roles were reversed.\nOn pages 41-47 we show separate combined balance sheets and\nearnings statements for: (1) our subsidiaries engaged in finance-\ntype operations, which are Mutual Savings and Scott Fetzer\nFinancial; (2) our insurance operations, with their major\ninvestment positions itemized; (3) our manufacturing, publishing\nand retailing businesses, leaving aside certain non-operating\nassets and purchase-price accounting adjustments; and (4) an all-\nother category that includes the non-operating assets (primarily\nmarketable securities) held by the companies in (3) as well as\nvarious assets and debts of the Wesco and Berkshire parent\ncompanies.\nIf you combine the earnings and the net worths of these four\nsegments, you will derive totals matching those shown on our GAAP\nstatements.\nHowever, we want to emphasize that our new\npresentation does not fall within the purview of our auditors,\nwho in no way bless it. (In fact, they may be horrified; I dont\nwant to ask.)\nI referred earlier to a major change in GAAP that is\nexpected in 1990.\nThis change relates to the calculation of\ndeferred taxes, and is both complicated and controversial - so\nmuch so that its imposition, originally scheduled for 1989, was\npostponed for a year.\nWhen implemented, the new rule will affect us in various\nways.\nMost important, we will be required to change the way we\ncalculate our liability for deferred taxes on the unrealized\nappreciation of stocks held by our insurance companies.\nRight now, our liability is layered.\nFor the unrealized\nappreciation that dates back to 1986 and earlier years, $1.2\nbillion, we have booked a 28% tax liability.\nFor the unrealized\nappreciation built up since, $600 million, the tax liability has\nbeen booked at 34%.\nThe difference reflects the increase in tax\nrates that went into effect in 1987.\nIt now appears, however, that the new accounting rule will\nrequire us to establish the entire liability at 34% in 1990,\ntaking the charge against our earnings.\nAssuming no change in\ntax rates by 1990, this step will reduce our earnings in that\nyear (and thereby our reported net worth) by $71 million.\nThe\nproposed rule will also affect other items on our balance sheet,\nbut these changes will have only a minor impact on earnings and\nnet worth.\nWe have no strong views about the desirability of this\nchange in calculation of deferred taxes.\nWe should point out,\nhowever, that neither a 28% nor a 34% tax liability precisely\ndepicts economic reality at Berkshire since we have no plans to\nsell the stocks in which we have the great bulk of our gains.\nTo those of you who are uninterested in accounting, I\napologize for this dissertation.\nI realize that many of you do\nnot pore over our figures, but instead hold Berkshire primarily\nbecause you know that: (1) Charlie and I have the bulk of our\nmoney in Berkshire; (2) we intend to run things so that your\ngains or losses are in direct proportion to ours; and (3) the\nrecord has so far been satisfactory.\nThere is nothing\nnecessarily wrong with this kind of faith approach to\ninvesting.\nOther shareholders, however, prefer an analysis\napproach and we want to supply the information they need.\nIn our\nown investing, we search for situations in which both approaches\ngive us the same answer.\nSources of Reported Earnings\nIn addition to supplying you with our new four-sector\naccounting material, we will continue to list the major sources\nof Berkshires reported earnings just as we have in the past.\nIn the following table, amortization of Goodwill and other\nmajor purchase-price accounting adjustments are not charged\nagainst the specific businesses to which they apply but are\ninstead aggregated and shown separately.\nThis procedure lets you\nview the earnings of our businesses as they would have been\nreported had we not purchased them.\nIve explained in past\nreports why this form of presentation seems to us to be more\nuseful to investors and managers than the standard GAAP\npresentation, which makes purchase-price adjustments on a\nbusiness-by-business basis.\nThe total net earnings we show in\nthe table are, of course, identical to the GAAP total in our\naudited financial statements.\nFurther information about these businesses is given in the\nBusiness Segment section on pages 32-34, and in the Managements\nDiscussion section on pages 36-40.\nIn these sections you also\nwill find our segment earnings reported on a GAAP basis.\nFor\ninformation on Wescos businesses, I urge you to read Charlie\nMungers letter, which starts on page 52.\nIt contains the best\ndescription I have seen of the events that produced the present\nsavings-and-loan crisis.\nAlso, take special note of Dave\nHillstroms performance at Precision Steel Warehouse, a Wesco\nsubsidiary.\nPrecision operates in an extremely competitive\nindustry, yet Dave consistently achieves good returns on invested\ncapital.\nThough data is lacking to prove the point, I think it\nis likely that his performance, both in 1988 and years past,\nwould rank him number one among his peers.\n(000s omitted)\n------------------------------------------\nBerkshire's Share\nof Net Earnings\n(after taxes and\nPre-Tax Earnings\nminority interests)\n-------------------\n-------------------\n1988\n1987\n1988\n1987\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nOperating Earnings:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting ............... $(11,081)\n$(55,429)\n$ (1,045)\n$(20,696)\nNet Investment Income ......\n231,250\n152,483\n197,779\n136,658\nBuffalo News .................\n42,429\n39,410\n25,462\n21,304\nFechheimer ...................\n14,152\n13,332\n7,720\n6,580\nKirby ........................\n26,891\n22,408\n17,842\n12,891\nNebraska Furniture Mart ......\n18,439\n16,837\n9,099\n7,554\nScott Fetzer\nManufacturing Group .......\n28,542\n30,591\n17,640\n17,555\nSees Candies ................\n32,473\n31,693\n19,671\n17,363\nWesco - other than Insurance\n16,133\n6,209\n10,650\n4,978\nWorld Book ...................\n27,890\n25,745\n18,021\n15,136\nAmortization of Goodwill .....\n(2,806)\n(2,862)\n(2,806)\n(2,862)\nOther Purchase-Price\nAccounting Charges ........\n(6,342)\n(5,546)\n(7,340)\n(6,544)\nInterest on Debt* ............\n(35,613)\n(11,474)\n(23,212)\n(5,905)\nShareholder-Designated\nContributions .............\n(4,966)\n(4,938)\n(3,217)\n(2,963)\nOther ........................\n41,059\n23,217\n27,177\n13,697\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nOperating Earnings .............\n418,450\n281,676\n313,441\n214,746\nSales of Securities ............\n131,671\n28,838\n85,829\n19,806\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nTotal Earnings - All Entities .. $550,121\n$310,514\n$399,270\n$234,552\n*Excludes interest expense of Scott Fetzer Financial Group.\nThe earnings achieved by our operating businesses are\nsuperb, whether measured on an absolute basis or against those of\ntheir competitors.\nFor that we thank our operating managers: You\nand I are fortunate to be associated with them.\nAt Berkshire, associations like these last a long time.\nWe\ndo not remove superstars from our lineup merely because they have\nattained a specified age - whether the traditional 65, or the 95\nreached by Mrs. B on the eve of Hanukkah in 1988.\nSuperb\nmanagers are too scarce a resource to be discarded simply because\na cake gets crowded with candles.\nMoreover, our experience with\nnewly-minted MBAs has not been that great.\nTheir academic\nrecords always look terrific and the candidates always know just\nwhat to say; but too often they are short on personal commitment\nto the company and general business savvy.\nIts difficult to\nteach a new dog old tricks.\nHeres an update on our major non-insurance operations:\no At Nebraska Furniture Mart, Mrs. B (Rose Blumkin) and her\ncart roll on and on.\nShes been the boss for 51 years, having\nstarted the business at 44 with $500. (Think what she would have\ndone with $1,000!) With Mrs. B, old age will always be ten years\naway.\nThe Mart, long the largest home furnishings store in the\ncountry, continues to grow.\nIn the fall, the store opened a\ndetached 20,000 square foot Clearance Center, which expands our\nability to offer bargains in all price ranges.\nRecently Dillards, one of the most successful department\nstore operations in the country, entered the Omaha market.\nIn\nmany of its stores, Dillards runs a full furniture department,\nundoubtedly doing well in this line.\nShortly before opening in\nOmaha, however, William Dillard, chairman of the company,\nannounced that his new store would not sell furniture.\nSaid he,\nreferring to NFM: We dont want to compete with them.\nWe think\nthey are about the best there is.\nAt the Buffalo News we extol the value of advertising, and\nour policies at NFM prove that we practice what we preach.\nOver\nthe past three years NFM has been the largest ROP advertiser in\nthe Omaha World-Herald. (ROP advertising is the kind printed in\nthe paper, as contrasted to the preprinted-insert kind.) In no\nother major market, to my knowledge, is a home furnishings\noperation the leading customer of the newspaper.\nAt times, we\nalso run large ads in papers as far away as Des Moines, Sioux\nCity and Kansas City - always with good results.\nIt truly does\npay to advertise, as long as you have something worthwhile to\noffer.\nMrs. Bs son, Louie, and his boys, Ron and Irv, complete the\nwinning Blumkin team.\nIts a joy to work with this family.\nAll\nits members have character that matches their extraordinary\nabilities.\no Last year I stated unequivocally that pre-tax margins at\nThe Buffalo News would fall in 1988.\nThat forecast would have\nproved correct at almost any other newspaper our size or larger.\nBut Stan Lipsey - bless him - has managed to make me look\nfoolish.\nThough we increased our prices a bit less than the industry\naverage last year, and though our newsprint costs and wage rates\nrose in line with industry norms, Stan actually improved margins\na tad.\nNo one in the newspaper business has a better managerial\nrecord.\nHe has achieved it, furthermore, while running a paper\nthat gives readers an extraordinary amount of news.\nWe believe\nthat our newshole percentage - the portion of the paper devoted\nto news - is bigger than that of any other dominant paper of our\nsize or larger.\nThe percentage was 49.5% in 1988 versus 49.8% in\n1987.\nWe are committed to keeping it around 50%, whatever the\nlevel or trend of profit margins.\nCharlie and I have loved the newspaper business since we\nwere youngsters, and we have had great fun with the News in the\n12 years since we purchased it.\nWe were fortunate to find Murray\nLight, a top-flight editor, on the scene when we arrived and he\nhas made us proud of the paper ever since.\no Sees Candies sold a record 25.1 million pounds in 1988.\nProspects did not look good at the end of October, but excellent\nChristmas volume, considerably better than the record set in\n1987, turned the tide.\nAs weve told you before, Sees business continues to become\nmore Christmas-concentrated.\nIn 1988, the Company earned a\nrecord 90% of its full-year profits in December: $29 million out\nof $32.5 million before tax. (Its enough to make you believe in\nSanta Claus.) Decembers deluge of business produces a modest\nseasonal bulge in Berkshires corporate earnings.\nAnother small\nbulge occurs in the first quarter, when most World Book annuals\nare sold.\nCharlie and I put Chuck Huggins in charge of Sees about\nfive minutes after we bought the company.\nUpon reviewing his\nrecord, you may wonder what took us so long.\no At Fechheimer, the Heldmans - Bob, George, Gary, Roger and\nFred - are the Cincinnati counterparts of the Blumkins.\nNeither\nfurniture retailing nor uniform manufacturing has inherently\nattractive economics.\nIn these businesses, only exceptional\nmanagements can deliver high returns on invested capital.\nAnd\nthats exactly what the five Heldmans do. (As Mets announcer\nRalph Kiner once said when comparing pitcher Steve Trout to his\nfather, Dizzy Trout, the famous Detroit Tigers pitcher: Theres\na lot of heredity in that family.)\nFechheimer made a fairly good-sized acquisition in 1988.\nCharlie and I have such confidence in the business savvy of the\nHeldman family that we okayed the deal without even looking at\nit.\nThere are very few managements anywhere - including those\nrunning the top tier companies of the Fortune 500 - in which we\nwould exhibit similar confidence.\nBecause of both this acquisition and some internal growth,\nsales at Fechheimer should be up significantly in 1989.\no All of the operations managed by Ralph Schey - World Book,\nKirby, and The Scott Fetzer Manufacturing Group - performed\nsplendidly in 1988.\nReturns on the capital entrusted to Ralph\ncontinue to be exceptional.\nWithin the Scott Fetzer Manufacturing Group, particularly\nfine progress was recorded at its largest unit, Campbell\nHausfeld.\nThis company, the countrys leading producer of small\nand medium-sized air compressors, has more than doubled earnings\nsince 1986.\nUnit sales at both Kirby and World Book were up\nsignificantly in 1988, with export business particularly strong.\nWorld Book became available in the Soviet Union in September,\nwhen that countrys largest American book store opened in Moscow.\nOurs is the only general encyclopedia offered at the store.\nRalphs personal productivity is amazing: In addition to\nrunning 19 businesses in superb fashion, he is active at The\nCleveland Clinic, Ohio University, Case Western Reserve, and a\nventure capital operation that has spawned sixteen Ohio-based\ncompanies and resurrected many others.\nBoth Ohio and Berkshire\nare fortunate to have Ralph on their side.\nBorsheims\nIt was in 1983 that Berkshire purchased an 80% interest in\nThe Nebraska Furniture Mart.\nYour Chairman blundered then by\nneglecting to ask Mrs. B a question any schoolboy would have\nthought of: Are there any more at home like you? Last month I\ncorrected the error: We are now 80% partners with another branch\nof the family.\nAfter Mrs. B came over from Russia in 1917, her parents and\nfive siblings followed. (Her two other siblings had preceded\nher.) Among the sisters was Rebecca Friedman who, with her\nhusband, Louis, escaped in 1922 to the west through Latvia in a\njourney as perilous as Mrs. Bs earlier odyssey to the east\nthrough Manchuria.\nWhen the family members reunited in Omaha\nthey had no tangible assets.\nHowever, they came equipped with an\nextraordinary combination of brains, integrity, and enthusiasm\nfor work - and thats all they needed.\nThey have since proved\nthemselves invincible.\nIn 1948 Mr. Friedman purchased Borsheims, a small Omaha\njewelry store.\nHe was joined in the business by his son, Ike, in\n1950 and, as the years went by, Ikes son, Alan, and his sons-in-\nlaw, Marvin Cohn and Donald Yale, came in also.\nYou wont be surprised to learn that this family brings to\nthe jewelry business precisely the same approach that the\nBlumkins bring to the furniture business.\nThe cornerstone for\nboth enterprises is Mrs. Bs creed: Sell cheap and tell the\ntruth. Other fundamentals at both businesses are: (1) single\nstore operations featuring huge inventories that provide\ncustomers with an enormous selection across all price ranges, (2)\ndaily attention to detail by top management, (3) rapid turnover,\n(4) shrewd buying, and (5) incredibly low expenses.\nThe\ncombination of the last three factors lets both stores offer\neveryday prices that no one in the country comes close to\nmatching.\nMost people, no matter how sophisticated they are in other\nmatters, feel like babes in the woods when purchasing jewelry.\nThey can judge neither quality nor price.\nFor them only one rule\nmakes sense: If you dont know jewelry, know the jeweler.\nI can assure you that those who put their trust in Ike\nFriedman and his family will never be disappointed.\nThe way in\nwhich we purchased our interest in their business is the ultimate\ntestimonial.\nBorsheims had no audited financial statements;\nnevertheless, we didnt take inventory, verify receivables or\naudit the operation in any way.\nIke simply told us what was so -\n- and on that basis we drew up a one-page contract and wrote a\nlarge check.\nBusiness at Borsheims has mushroomed in recent years as the\nreputation of the Friedman family has spread.\nCustomers now come\nto the store from all over the country.\nAmong them have been\nsome friends of mine from both coasts who thanked me later for\ngetting them there.\nBorsheims new links to Berkshire will change nothing in the\nway this business is run.\nAll members of the Friedman family\nwill continue to operate just as they have before; Charlie and I\nwill stay on the sidelines where we belong.\nAnd when we say all\nmembers, the words have real meaning.\nMr. and Mrs. Friedman, at\n88 and 87, respectively, are in the store daily.\nThe wives of\nIke, Alan, Marvin and Donald all pitch in at busy times, and a\nfourth generation is beginning to learn the ropes.\nIt is great fun to be in business with people you have long\nadmired.\nThe Friedmans, like the Blumkins, have achieved success\nbecause they have deserved success.\nBoth families focus on\nwhats right for the customer and that, inevitably, works out\nwell for them, also.\nWe couldnt have better partners.\nInsurance Operations\nShown below is an updated version of our usual table\npresenting key figures for the insurance industry:\nStatutory\nYearly Change\nCombined Ratio\nYearly Change\nInflation Rate\nin Premiums\nAfter Policyholder\nin Incurred\nMeasured by\nWritten (%)\nDividends\nLosses (%)\nGNP Deflator (%)\n-------------\n------------------\n-------------\n----------------\n1981 .....\n3.8\n106.0\n6.5\n9.6\n1982 .....\n3.7\n109.6\n8.4\n6.4\n1983 .....\n5.0\n112.0\n6.8\n3.8\n1984 .....\n8.5\n118.0\n16.9\n3.7\n1985 .....\n22.1\n116.3\n16.1\n3.2\n1986 .....\n22.2\n108.0\n13.5\n2.7\n1987 .....\n9.4\n104.6\n7.8\n3.3\n1988 (Est.)\n3.9\n105.4\n4.2\n3.6\nSource: A.M. Best Co.\nThe combined ratio represents total insurance costs (losses\nincurred plus expenses) compared to revenue from premiums: A\nratio below 100 indicates an underwriting profit, and one above\n100 indicates a loss.\nWhen the investment income that an insurer\nearns from holding on to policyholders funds (the float) is\ntaken into account, a combined ratio in the 107-111 range\ntypically produces an overall break-even result, exclusive of\nearnings on the funds provided by shareholders.\nFor the reasons laid out in previous reports, we expect the\nindustrys incurred losses to grow by about 10% annually, even in\nyears when general inflation runs considerably lower.\nIf premium\ngrowth meanwhile materially lags that 10% rate, underwriting\nlosses will mount, though the industrys tendency to underreserve\nwhen business turns bad may obscure their size for a time.\nAs\nthe table shows, the industrys underwriting loss grew in 1988.\nThis trend is almost certain to continue - and probably will\naccelerate - for at least two more years.\nThe property-casualty insurance industry is not only\nsubnormally profitable, it is subnormally popular. (As Sam\nGoldwyn philosophized: In life, one must learn to take the\nbitter with the sour.) One of the ironies of business is that\nmany relatively-unprofitable industries that are plagued by\ninadequate prices habitually find themselves beat upon by irate\ncustomers even while other, hugely profitable industries are\nspared complaints, no matter how high their prices.\nTake the breakfast cereal industry, whose return on invested\ncapital is more than double that of the auto insurance industry\n(which is why companies like Kellogg and General Mills sell at\nfive times book value and most large insurers sell close to\nbook).\nThe cereal companies regularly impose price increases,\nfew of them related to a significant jump in their costs.\nYet\nnot a peep is heard from consumers.\nBut when auto insurers raise\nprices by amounts that do not even match cost increases,\ncustomers are outraged.\nIf you want to be loved, its clearly\nbetter to sell high-priced corn flakes than low-priced auto\ninsurance.\nThe antagonism that the public feels toward the industry can\nhave serious consequences: Proposition 103, a California\ninitiative passed last fall, threatens to push auto insurance\nprices down sharply, even though costs have been soaring.\nThe\nprice cut has been suspended while the courts review the\ninitiative, but the resentment that brought on the vote has not\nbeen suspended: Even if the initiative is overturned, insurers\nare likely to find it tough to operate profitably in California.\n(Thank heavens the citizenry isnt mad at bonbons: If Proposition\n103 applied to candy as well as insurance, Sees would be forced\nto sell its product for $5.76 per pound. rather than the $7.60 we\ncharge - and would be losing money by the bucketful.)\nThe immediate direct effects on Berkshire from the\ninitiative are minor, since we saw few opportunities for profit\nin the rate structure that existed in California prior to the\nvote.\nHowever, the forcing down of prices would seriously affect\nGEICO, our 44%-owned investee, which gets about 10% of its\npremium volume from California.\nEven more threatening to GEICO\nis the possibility that similar pricing actions will be taken in\nother states, through either initiatives or legislation.\nIf voters insist that auto insurance be priced below cost,\nit eventually must be sold by government.\nStockholders can\nsubsidize policyholders for a short period, but only taxpayers\ncan subsidize them over the long term.\nAt most property-casualty\ncompanies, socialized auto insurance would be no disaster for\nshareholders.\nBecause of the commodity characteristics of the\nindustry, most insurers earn mediocre returns and therefore have\nlittle or no economic goodwill to lose if they are forced by\ngovernment to leave the auto insurance business.\nBut GEICO,\nbecause it is a low-cost producer able to earn high returns on\nequity, has a huge amount of economic goodwill at risk.\nIn turn,\nso do we.\nAt Berkshire, in 1988, our premium volume continued to fall,\nand in 1989 we will experience a large decrease for a special\nreason: The contract through which we receive 7% of the business\nof Firemans Fund expires on August 31.\nAt that time, we will\nreturn to Firemans Fund the unearned premiums we hold that\nrelate to the contract.\nThis transfer of funds will show up in\nour premiums written account as a negative $85 million or so\nand will make our third-quarter figures look rather peculiar.\nHowever, the termination of this contract will not have a\nsignificant effect on profits.\nBerkshires underwriting results continued to be excellent\nin 1988.\nOur combined ratio (on a statutory basis and excluding\nstructured settlements and financial reinsurance) was 104.\nReserve development was favorable for the second year in a row,\nafter a string of years in which it was very unsatisfactory.\nDetails on both underwriting and reserve development appear on\npages 36-38.\nOur insurance volume over the next few years is likely to\nrun very low, since business with a reasonable potential for\nprofit will almost certainly be scarce.\nSo be it.\nAt Berkshire,\nwe simply will not write policies at rates that carry the\nexpectation of economic loss.\nWe encounter enough troubles when\nwe expect a gain.\nDespite - or perhaps because of - low volume, our profit\npicture during the next few years is apt to be considerably\nbrighter than the industrys.\nWe are sure to have an exceptional\namount of float compared to premium volume, and that augurs well\nfor profits.\nIn 1989 and 1990 we expect our float/premiums\nratio to be at least three times that of the typical\nproperty/casualty company.\nMike Goldberg, with special help from\nAjit Jain, Dinos Iordanou, and the National Indemnity managerial\nteam, has positioned us well in that respect.\nAt some point - we dont know when - we will be deluged with\ninsurance business.\nThe cause will probably be some major\nphysical or financial catastrophe.\nBut we could also experience\nan explosion in business, as we did in 1985, because large and\nincreasing underwriting losses at other companies coincide with\ntheir recognition that they are far underreserved. in the\nmeantime, we will retain our talented professionals, protect our\ncapital, and try not to make major mistakes.\nMarketable Securities\nIn selecting marketable securities for our insurance\ncompanies, we can choose among five major categories: (1) long-\nterm common stock investments, (2) medium-term fixed-income\nsecurities, (3) long-term fixed-income securities, (4) short-term\ncash equivalents, and (5) short-term arbitrage commitments.\nWe have no particular bias when it comes to choosing from\nthese categories. We just continuously search among them for the\nhighest after-tax returns as measured by mathematical\nexpectation, limiting ourselves always to investment\nalternatives we think we understand.\nOur criteria have nothing\nto do with maximizing immediately reportable earnings; our goal,\nrather, is to maximize eventual net worth.\no Below we list our common stock holdings having a value over\n$100 million, not including arbitrage commitments, which will be\ndiscussed later.\nA small portion of these investments belongs to\nsubsidiaries of which Berkshire owns less than 100%.\nShares\nCompany\nCost\nMarket\n------\n-------\n----------\n----------\n(000s omitted)\n3,000,000\nCapital Cities/ABC, Inc. ..............\n$517,500\n$1,086,750\n14,172,500\nThe Coca-Cola Company .................\n592,540\n632,448\n2,400,000\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage\nCorporation Preferred* .............\n71,729\n121,200\n6,850,000\nGEICO Corporation .....................\n45,713\n849,400\n1,727,765\nThe Washington Post Company ...........\n9,731\n364,126\n*Although\nnominally a preferred stock, this security is\nfinancially equivalent to a common stock.\nOur permanent holdings - Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., GEICO\nCorporation, and The Washington Post Company - remain unchanged.\nAlso unchanged is our unqualified admiration of their\nmanagements: Tom Murphy and Dan Burke at Cap Cities, Bill Snyder\nand Lou Simpson at GEICO, and Kay Graham and Dick Simmons at The\nWashington Post.\nCharlie and I appreciate enormously the talent\nand integrity these managers bring to their businesses.\nTheir performance, which we have observed at close range,\ncontrasts vividly with that of many CEOs, which we have\nfortunately observed from a safe distance.\nSometimes these CEOs\nclearly do not belong in their jobs; their positions,\nnevertheless, are usually secure.\nThe supreme irony of business\nmanagement is that it is far easier for an inadequate CEO to keep\nhis job than it is for an inadequate subordinate.\nIf a secretary, say, is hired for a job that requires typing\nability of at least 80 words a minute and turns out to be capable\nof only 50 words a minute, she will lose her job in no time.\nThere is a logical standard for this job; performance is easily\nmeasured; and if you cant make the grade, youre out.\nSimilarly, if new sales people fail to generate sufficient\nbusiness quickly enough, they will be let go.\nExcuses will not\nbe accepted as a substitute for orders.\nHowever, a CEO who doesnt perform is frequently carried\nindefinitely.\nOne reason is that performance standards for his\njob seldom exist.\nWhen they do, they are often fuzzy or they may\nbe waived or explained away, even when the performance shortfalls\nare major and repeated.\nAt too many companies, the boss shoots\nthe arrow of managerial performance and then hastily paints the\nbullseye around the spot where it lands.\nAnother important, but seldom recognized, distinction\nbetween the boss and the foot soldier is that the CEO has no\nimmediate superior whose performance is itself getting measured.\nThe sales manager who retains a bunch of lemons in his sales\nforce will soon be in hot water himself.\nIt is in his immediate\nself-interest to promptly weed out his hiring mistakes.\nOtherwise, he himself may be weeded out.\nAn office manager who\nhas hired inept secretaries faces the same imperative.\nBut the CEOs boss is a Board of Directors that seldom\nmeasures itself and is infrequently held to account for\nsubstandard corporate performance.\nIf the Board makes a mistake\nin hiring, and perpetuates that mistake, so what?\nEven if the\ncompany is taken over because of the mistake, the deal will\nprobably bestow substantial benefits on the outgoing Board\nmembers. (The bigger they are, the softer they fall.)\nFinally, relations between the Board and the CEO are\nexpected to be congenial.\nAt board meetings, criticism of the\nCEOs performance is often viewed as the social equivalent of\nbelching.\nNo such inhibitions restrain the office manager from\ncritically evaluating the substandard typist.\nThese points should not be interpreted as a blanket\ncondemnation of CEOs or Boards of Directors: Most are able and\nhard-working, and a number are truly outstanding.\nBut the\nmanagement failings that Charlie and I have seen make us thankful\nthat we are linked with the managers of our three permanent\nholdings.\nThey love their businesses, they think like owners,\nand they exude integrity and ability.\no In 1988 we made major purchases of Federal Home Loan\nMortgage Pfd. (Freddie Mac) and Coca Cola.\nWe expect to hold\nthese securities for a long time.\nIn fact, when we own portions\nof outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our\nfavorite holding period is forever.\nWe are just the opposite of\nthose who hurry to sell and book profits when companies perform\nwell but who tenaciously hang on to businesses that disappoint.\nPeter Lynch aptly likens such behavior to cutting the flowers and\nwatering the weeds.\nOur holdings of Freddie Mac are the maximum\nallowed by law, and are extensively described by Charlie in his\nletter.\nIn our consolidated balance sheet these shares are\ncarried at cost rather than market, since they are owned by\nMutual Savings and Loan, a non-insurance subsidiary.\nWe continue to concentrate our investments in a very few\ncompanies that we try to understand well.\nThere are only a\nhandful of businesses about which we have strong long-term\nconvictions.\nTherefore, when we find such a business, we want to\nparticipate in a meaningful way.\nWe agree with Mae West: Too\nmuch of a good thing can be wonderful.\no We reduced our holdings of medium-term tax-exempt bonds by\nabout $100 million last year.\nAll of the bonds sold were\nacquired after August 7, 1986. When such bonds are held by\nproperty-casualty insurance companies, 15% of the tax-exempt\ninterest earned is subject to tax.\nThe $800 million position we still hold consists almost\nentirely of bonds grandfathered under the Tax Reform Act of\n1986, which means they are entirely tax-exempt.\nOur sales\nproduced a small profit and our remaining bonds, which have an\naverage maturity of about six years, are worth modestly more than\ncarrying value.\nLast year we described our holdings of short-term and\nintermediate-term bonds of Texaco, which was then in bankruptcy.\nDuring 1988, we sold practically all of these bonds at a pre-tax\nprofit of about $22 million.\nThis sale explains close to $100\nmillion of the reduction in fixed-income securities on our\nbalance sheet.\nWe also told you last year about our holdings of another\nsecurity whose predominant characteristics are those of an\nintermediate fixed-income issue: our $700 million position in\nSalomon Inc 9% convertible preferred.\nThis preferred has a\nsinking fund that will retire it in equal annual installments\nfrom 1995 to 1999.\nBerkshire carries this holding at cost.\nFor\nreasons discussed by Charlie on page 69, the estimated market\nvalue of our holding has improved from moderately under cost at\nthe end of last year to moderately over cost at 1988 year end.\nThe close association we have had with John Gutfreund, CEO\nof Salomon, during the past year has reinforced our admiration\nfor him.\nBut we continue to have no great insights about the\nnear, intermediate or long-term economics of the investment\nbanking business: This is not an industry in which it is easy to\nforecast future levels of profitability.\nWe continue to believe\nthat our conversion privilege could well have important value\nover the life of our preferred.\nHowever, the overwhelming\nportion of the preferreds value resides in its fixed-income\ncharacteristics, not its equity characteristics.\no We have not lost our aversion to long-term bonds.\nWe will\nbecome enthused about such securities only when we become\nenthused about prospects for long-term stability in the\npurchasing power of money.\nAnd that kind of stability isnt in\nthe cards: Both society and elected officials simply have too\nmany higher-ranking priorities that conflict with purchasing-\npower stability.\nThe only long-term bonds we hold are those of\nWashington Public Power Supply Systems (WPPSS).\nA few of our\nWPPSS bonds have short maturities and many others, because of\ntheir high coupons, are likely to be refunded and paid off in a\nfew years.\nOverall, our WPPSS holdings are carried on our\nbalance sheet at $247 million and have a market value of about\n$352 million.\nWe explained the reasons for our WPPSS purchases in the 1983\nannual report, and are pleased to tell you that this commitment\nhas worked out about as expected.\nAt the time of purchase, most\nof our bonds were yielding around 17% after taxes and carried no\nratings, which had been suspended.\nRecently, the bonds were\nrated AA- by Standard & Poors.\nThey now sell at levels only\nslightly below those enjoyed by top-grade credits.\nIn the 1983 report, we compared the economics of our WPPSS\npurchase to those involved in buying a business.\nAs it turned\nout, this purchase actually worked out better than did the\ngeneral run of business acquisitions made in 1983, assuming both\nare measured on the basis of unleveraged, after tax returns\nachieved through 1988.\nOur WPPSS experience, though pleasant, does nothing to alter\nour negative opinion about long-term bonds.\nIt only makes us\nhope that we run into some other large stigmatized issue, whose\ntroubles have caused it to be significantly misappraised by the\nmarket.\nArbitrage\nIn past reports we have told you that our insurance\nsubsidiaries sometimes engage in arbitrage as an alternative to\nholding short-term cash equivalents. We prefer, of course, to\nmake major long-term commitments, but we often have more cash\nthan good ideas.\nAt such times, arbitrage sometimes promises\nmuch greater returns than Treasury Bills and, equally important,\ncools any temptation we may have to relax our standards for long-\nterm investments.\n(Charlies sign off after weve talked about\nan arbitrage commitment is usually: Okay, at least it will keep\nyou out of bars.)\nDuring 1988 we made unusually large profits from arbitrage,\nmeasured both by absolute dollars and rate of return.\nOur pre-\ntax gain was about $78 million on average invested funds of about\n$147 million.\nThis level of activity makes some detailed discussion of\narbitrage and our approach to it appropriate.\nOnce, the word\napplied only to the simultaneous purchase and sale of securities\nor foreign exchange in two different markets.\nThe goal was to\nexploit tiny price differentials that might exist between, say,\nRoyal Dutch stock trading in guilders in Amsterdam, pounds in\nLondon, and dollars in New York.\nSome people might call this\nscalping; it wont surprise you that practitioners opted for the\nFrench term, arbitrage.\nSince World War I the definition of arbitrage - or risk\narbitrage, as it is now sometimes called - has expanded to\ninclude the pursuit of profits from an announced corporate event\nsuch as sale of the company, merger, recapitalization,\nreorganization, liquidation, self-tender, etc.\nIn most cases the\narbitrageur expects to profit regardless of the behavior of the\nstock market.\nThe major risk he usually faces instead is that\nthe announced event wont happen.\nSome offbeat opportunities occasionally arise in the\narbitrage field.\nI participated in one of these when I was 24\nand working in New York for Graham-Newman Corp. Rockwood & Co.,\na Brooklyn based chocolate products company of limited\nprofitability, had adopted LIFO inventory valuation in 1941\nwhen cocoa was selling for 5¢ per pound.\nIn 1954 a\ntemporary shortage of cocoa caused the price to soar to over\n60&cent.\nConsequently Rockwood wished to unload its valuable\ninventory - quickly, before the price dropped.\nBut if the cocoa\nhad simply been sold off, the company would have owed close to\na 50% tax on the proceeds.\nThe 1954 Tax Code came to the rescue.\nIt contained an\narcane provision that eliminated the tax otherwise due on LIFO\nprofits if inventory was distributed to shareholders as part of a\nplan reducing the scope of a corporations business.\nRockwood\ndecided to terminate one of its businesses, the sale of cocoa\nbutter, and said 13 million pounds of its cocoa bean inventory\nwas attributable to that activity.\nAccordingly, the company\noffered to repurchase its stock in exchange for the cocoa beans\nit no longer needed, paying 80 pounds of beans for each share.\nFor several weeks I busily bought shares, sold beans, and\nmade periodic stops at Schroeder Trust to exchange stock\ncertificates for warehouse receipts.\nThe profits were good and\nmy only expense was subway tokens.\nThe architect of Rockwoods restructuring was an unknown,\nbut brilliant Chicagoan, Jay Pritzker, then 32.\nIf youre\nfamiliar with Jays subsequent record, you wont be surprised to\nhear the action worked out rather well for Rockwoods continuing\nshareholders also.\nFrom shortly before the tender until shortly\nafter it, Rockwood stock appreciated from 15 to 100, even though\nthe company was experiencing large operating losses.\nSometimes\nthere is more to stock valuation than price-earnings ratios.\nIn recent years, most arbitrage operations have involved\ntakeovers, friendly and unfriendly.\nWith acquisition fever\nrampant, with anti-trust challenges almost non-existent, and with\nbids often ratcheting upward, arbitrageurs have prospered\nmightily.\nThey have not needed special talents to do well; the\ntrick, a la Peter Sellers in the movie, has simply been Being\nThere. In Wall Street the old proverb has been reworded: Give a\nman a fish and you feed him for a day.\nTeach him how to\narbitrage and you feed him forever. (If, however, he studied at\nthe Ivan Boesky School of Arbitrage, it may be a state\ninstitution that supplies his meals.)\nTo evaluate arbitrage situations you must answer four\nquestions: (1) How likely is it that the promised event will\nindeed occur? (2) How long will your money be tied up? (3) What\nchance is there that something still better will transpire - a\ncompeting takeover bid, for example? and (4) What will happen if\nthe event does not take place because of anti-trust action,\nfinancing glitches, etc.?\nArcata Corp., one of our more serendipitous arbitrage\nexperiences, illustrates the twists and turns of the business.\nOn September 28, 1981 the directors of Arcata agreed in principle\nto sell the company to Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. (KKR),\nthen and now a major leveraged-buy out firm.\nArcata was in the\nprinting and forest products businesses and had one other thing\ngoing for it: In 1978 the U.S. Government had taken title to\n10,700 acres of Arcata timber, primarily old-growth redwood, to\nexpand Redwood National Park.\nThe government had paid $97.9\nmillion, in several installments, for this acreage, a sum Arcata\nwas contesting as grossly inadequate.\nThe parties also disputed\nthe interest rate that should apply to the period between the\ntaking of the property and final payment for it.\nThe enabling\nlegislation stipulated 6% simple interest; Arcata argued for a\nmuch higher and compounded rate.\nBuying a company with a highly-speculative, large-sized\nclaim in litigation creates a negotiating problem, whether the\nclaim is on behalf of or against the company.\nTo solve this\nproblem, KKR offered $37.00 per Arcata share plus two-thirds of\nany additional amounts paid by the government for the redwood\nlands.\nAppraising this arbitrage opportunity, we had to ask\nourselves whether KKR would consummate the transaction since,\namong other things, its offer was contingent upon its obtaining\nsatisfactory financing. A clause of this kind is always\ndangerous for the seller: It offers an easy exit for a suitor\nwhose ardor fades between proposal and marriage.\nHowever, we\nwere not particularly worried about this possibility because\nKKRs past record for closing had been good.\nWe also had to ask ourselves what would happen if the KKR\ndeal did fall through, and here we also felt reasonably\ncomfortable: Arcatas management and directors had been shopping\nthe company for some time and were clearly determined to sell.\nIf KKR went away, Arcata would likely find another buyer, though\nof course, the price might be lower.\nFinally, we had to ask ourselves what the redwood claim\nmight be worth.\nYour Chairman, who cant tell an elm from an\noak, had no trouble with that one: He coolly evaluated the claim\nat somewhere between zero and a whole lot.\nWe started buying Arcata stock, then around $33.50, on\nSeptember 30 and in eight weeks purchased about 400,000 shares,\nor 5% of the company.\nThe initial announcement said that the\n$37.00 would be paid in January, 1982.\nTherefore, if everything\nhad gone perfectly, we would have achieved an annual rate of\nreturn of about 40% - not counting the redwood claim, which would\nhave been frosting.\nAll did not go perfectly.\nIn December it was announced that\nthe closing would be delayed a bit.\nNevertheless, a definitive\nagreement was signed on January 4. Encouraged, we raised our\nstake, buying at around $38.00 per share and increasing our\nholdings to 655,000 shares, or over 7% of the company.\nOur\nwillingness to pay up - even though the closing had been\npostponed - reflected our leaning toward a whole lot rather\nthan zero for the redwoods.\nThen, on February 25 the lenders said they were taking a\nsecond look at financing terms  in view of the severely\ndepressed housing industry and its impact on Arcatas outlook.\nThe stockholders meeting was postponed again, to April.\nAn\nArcata spokesman said he did not think the fate of the\nacquisition itself was imperiled. When arbitrageurs hear such\nreassurances, their minds flash to the old saying: He lied like\na finance minister on the eve of devaluation.\nOn March 12 KKR said its earlier deal wouldnt work, first\ncutting its offer to $33.50, then two days later raising it to\n$35.00. On March 15, however, the directors turned this bid down\nand accepted another groups offer of $37.50 plus one-half of any\nredwood recovery.\nThe shareholders okayed the deal, and the\n$37.50 was paid on June 4.\nWe received $24.6 million versus our cost of $22.9 million;\nour average holding period was close to six months.\nConsidering\nthe trouble this transaction encountered, our 15% annual rate of\nreturn excluding any value for the redwood claim - was more than\nsatisfactory.\nBut the best was yet to come.\nThe trial judge appointed two\ncommissions, one to look at the timbers value, the other to\nconsider the interest rate questions.\nIn January 1987, the first\ncommission said the redwoods were worth $275.7 million and the\nsecond commission recommended a compounded, blended rate of\nreturn working out to about 14%.\nIn August 1987 the judge upheld these conclusions, which\nmeant a net amount of about $600 million would be due Arcata.\nThe government then appealed.\nIn 1988, though, before this\nappeal was heard, the claim was settled for $519 million.\nConsequently, we received an additional $29.48 per share, or\nabout $19.3 million.\nWe will get another $800,000 or so in 1989.\nBerkshires arbitrage activities differ from those of many\narbitrageurs.\nFirst, we participate in only a few, and usually\nvery large, transactions each year.\nMost practitioners buy into\na great many deals perhaps 50 or more per year.\nWith that many\nirons in the fire, they must spend most of their time monitoring\nboth the progress of deals and the market movements of the\nrelated stocks.\nThis is not how Charlie nor I wish to spend our\nlives. (Whats the sense in getting rich just to stare at a\nticker tape all day?)\nBecause we diversify so little, one particularly profitable\nor unprofitable transaction will affect our yearly result from\narbitrage far more than it will the typical arbitrage operation.\nSo far, Berkshire has not had a really bad experience.\nBut we\nwill - and when it happens well report the gory details to you.\nThe other way we differ from some arbitrage operations is\nthat we participate only in transactions that have been publicly\nannounced.\nWe do not trade on rumors or try to guess takeover\ncandidates.\nWe just read the newspapers, think about a few of\nthe big propositions, and go by our own sense of probabilities.\nAt yearend, our only major arbitrage position was 3,342,000\nshares of RJR Nabisco with a cost of $281.8 million and a market\nvalue of $304.5 million.\nIn January we increased our holdings to\nroughly four million shares and in February we eliminated our\nposition.\nAbout three million shares were accepted when we\ntendered our holdings to KKR, which acquired RJR, and the\nreturned shares were promptly sold in the market.\nOur pre-tax\nprofit was a better-than-expected $64 million.\nEarlier, another familiar face turned up in the RJR bidding\ncontest: Jay Pritzker, who was part of a First Boston group that\nmade a tax-oriented offer.\nTo quote Yogi Berra; It was deja vu\nall over again.\nDuring most of the time when we normally would have been\npurchasers of RJR, our activities in the stock were restricted\nbecause of Salomons participation in a bidding group.\nCustomarily, Charlie and I, though we are directors of Salomon,\nare walled off from information about its merger and acquisition\nwork.\nWe have asked that it be that way: The information would\ndo us no good and could, in fact, occasionally inhibit\nBerkshires arbitrage operations.\nHowever, the unusually large commitment that Salomon\nproposed to make in the RJR deal required that all directors be\nfully informed and involved.\nTherefore, Berkshires purchases of\nRJR were made at only two times: first, in the few days\nimmediately following managements announcement of buyout plans,\nbefore Salomon became involved; and considerably later, after the\nRJR board made its decision in favor of KKR.\nBecause we could\nnot buy at other times, our directorships cost Berkshire\nsignificant money.\nConsidering Berkshires good results in 1988, you might\nexpect us to pile into arbitrage during 1989.\nInstead, we expect\nto be on the sidelines.\nOne pleasant reason is that our cash holdings are down -\nbecause our position in equities that we expect to hold for a\nvery long time is substantially up.\nAs regular readers of this\nreport know, our new commitments are not based on a judgment\nabout short-term prospects for the stock market.\nRather, they\nreflect an opinion about long-term business prospects for\nspecific companies.\nWe do not have, never have had, and never\nwill have an opinion about where the stock market, interest\nrates, or business activity will be a year from now.\nEven if we had a lot of cash we probably would do little in\narbitrage in 1989.\nSome extraordinary excesses have developed in\nthe takeover field.\nAs Dorothy says: Toto, I have a feeling\nwere not in Kansas any more.\nWe have no idea how long the excesses will last, nor do we\nknow what will change the attitudes of government, lender and\nbuyer that fuel them.\nBut we do know that the less the prudence\nwith which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence\nwith which we should conduct our own affairs.\nWe have no desire\nto arbitrage transactions that reflect the unbridled - and, in\nour view, often unwarranted - optimism of both buyers and\nlenders.\nIn our activities, we will heed the wisdom of Herb\nStein: If something cant go on forever, it will end.\nEfficient Market Theory\nThe preceding discussion about arbitrage makes a small\ndiscussion of efficient market theory (EMT) also seem relevant.\nThis doctrine became highly fashionable - indeed, almost holy\nscripture in academic circles during the 1970s.\nEssentially, it\nsaid that analyzing stocks was useless because all public\ninformation about them was appropriately reflected in their\nprices.\nIn other words, the market always knew everything.\nAs a\ncorollary, the professors who taught EMT said that someone\nthrowing darts at the stock tables could select a stock portfolio\nhaving prospects just as good as one selected by the brightest,\nmost hard-working security analyst.\nAmazingly, EMT was embraced\nnot only by academics, but by many investment professionals and\ncorporate managers as well.\nObserving correctly that the market\nwas frequently efficient, they went on to conclude incorrectly\nthat it was always efficient.\nThe difference between these\npropositions is night and day.\nIn my opinion, the continuous 63-year arbitrage experience\nof Graham-Newman Corp. Buffett Partnership, and Berkshire\nillustrates just how foolish EMT is. (Theres plenty of other\nevidence, also.) While at Graham-Newman, I made a study of its\nearnings from arbitrage during the entire 1926-1956 lifespan of\nthe company.\nUnleveraged returns averaged 20% per year.\nStarting in 1956, I applied Ben Grahams arbitrage principles,\nfirst at Buffett Partnership and then Berkshire.\nThough Ive not\nmade an exact calculation, I have done enough work to know that\nthe 1956-1988 returns averaged well over 20%. (Of course, I\noperated in an environment far more favorable than Bens; he had\n1929-1932 to contend with.)\nAll of the conditions are present that are required for a\nfair test of portfolio performance: (1) the three organizations\ntraded hundreds of different securities while building this 63-\nyear record; (2) the results are not skewed by a few fortunate\nexperiences; (3) we did not have to dig for obscure facts or\ndevelop keen insights about products or managements - we simply\nacted on highly-publicized events; and (4) our arbitrage\npositions were a clearly identified universe - they have not been\nselected by hindsight.\nOver the 63 years, the general market delivered just under a\n10% annual return, including dividends.\nThat means $1,000 would\nhave grown to $405,000 if all income had been reinvested.\nA 20%\nrate of return, however, would have produced $97 million.\nThat\nstrikes us as a statistically-significant differential that\nmight, conceivably, arouse ones curiosity.\nYet proponents of the theory have never seemed interested in\ndiscordant evidence of this type.\nTrue, they dont talk quite as\nmuch about their theory today as they used to.\nBut no one, to my\nknowledge, has ever said he was wrong, no matter how many\nthousands of students he has sent forth misinstructed.\nEMT,\nmoreover, continues to be an integral part of the investment\ncurriculum at major business schools.\nApparently, a reluctance\nto recant, and thereby to demystify the priesthood, is not\nlimited to theologians.\nNaturally the disservice done students and gullible\ninvestment professionals who have swallowed EMT has been an\nextraordinary service to us and other followers of Graham.\nIn\nany sort of a contest - financial, mental, or physical - its an\nenormous advantage to have opponents who have been taught that\nits useless to even try.\nFrom a selfish point of view,\nGrahamites should probably endow chairs to ensure the perpetual\nteaching of EMT.\nAll this said, a warning is appropriate.\nArbitrage has\nlooked easy recently.\nBut this is not a form of investing that\nguarantees profits of 20% a year or, for that matter, profits of\nany kind.\nAs noted, the market is reasonably efficient much of\nthe time: For every arbitrage opportunity we seized in that 63-\nyear period, many more were foregone because they seemed\nproperly-priced.\nAn investor cannot obtain superior profits from stocks by\nsimply committing to a specific investment category or style.\nHe\ncan earn them only by carefully evaluating facts and continuously\nexercising discipline.\nInvesting in arbitrage situations, per\nse, is no better a strategy than selecting a portfolio by\nthrowing darts.\nNew York Stock Exchange Listing\nBerkshires shares were listed on the New York Stock\nExchange on November 29, 1988.\nOn pages 50-51 we reproduce the\nletter we sent to shareholders concerning the listing.\nLet me clarify one point not dealt with in the letter:\nThough our round lot for trading on the NYSE is ten shares, any\nnumber of shares from one on up can be bought or sold.\nAs the letter explains, our primary goal in listing was to\nreduce transaction costs, and we believe this goal is being\nachieved.\nGenerally, the spread between the bid and asked price\non the NYSE has been well below the spread that prevailed in the\nover-the-counter market.\nHenderson Brothers, Inc., the specialist in our shares, is\nthe oldest continuing specialist firm on the Exchange; its\nprogenitor, William Thomas Henderson, bought his seat for $500 on\nSeptember 8, 1861. (Recently, seats were selling for about\n$625,000.) Among the 54 firms acting as specialists, HBI ranks\nsecond in number of stocks assigned, with 83.\nWe were pleased\nwhen Berkshire was allocated to HBI, and have been delighted with\nthe firms performance.\nJim Maguire, Chairman of HBI, personally\nmanages the trading in Berkshire, and we could not be in better\nhands.\nIn two respects our goals probably differ somewhat from\nthose of most listed companies.\nFirst, we do not want to\nmaximize the price at which Berkshire shares trade.\nWe wish\ninstead for them to trade in a narrow range centered at intrinsic\nbusiness value (which we hope increases at a reasonable - or,\nbetter yet, unreasonable - rate).\nCharlie and I are bothered as\nmuch by significant overvaluation as significant undervaluation.\nBoth extremes will inevitably produce results for many\nshareholders that will differ sharply from Berkshires business\nresults.\nIf our stock price instead consistently mirrors\nbusiness value, each of our shareholders will receive an\ninvestment result that roughly parallels the business results of\nBerkshire during his holding period.\nSecond, we wish for very little trading activity.\nIf we ran\na private business with a few passive partners, we would be\ndisappointed if those partners, and their replacements,\nfrequently wanted to leave the partnership.\nRunning a public\ncompany, we feel the same way.\nOur goal is to attract long-term owners who, at the time of\npurchase, have no timetable or price target for sale but plan\ninstead to stay with us indefinitely.\nWe dont understand the\nCEO who wants lots of stock activity, for that can be achieved\nonly if many of his owners are constantly exiting.\nAt what other\norganization - school, club, church, etc. - do leaders cheer when\nmembers leave? (However, if there were a broker whose livelihood\ndepended upon the membership turnover in such organizations, you\ncould be sure that there would be at least one proponent of\nactivity, as in: There hasnt been much going on in Christianity\nfor a while; maybe we should switch to Buddhism next week.)\nOf course, some Berkshire owners will need or want to sell\nfrom time to time, and we wish for good replacements who will pay\nthem a fair price.\nTherefore we try, through our policies,\nperformance, and communications, to attract new shareholders who\nunderstand our operations, share our time horizons, and measure\nus as we measure ourselves.\nIf we can continue to attract this\nsort of shareholder - and, just as important, can continue to be\nuninteresting to those with short-term or unrealistic\nexpectations - Berkshire shares should consistently sell at\nprices reasonably related to business value.\nDavid L. Dodd\nDave Dodd, my friend and teacher for 38 years, died last\nyear at age 93.\nMost of you dont know of him.\nYet any long-\ntime shareholder of Berkshire is appreciably wealthier because of\nthe indirect influence he had upon our company.\nDave spent a lifetime teaching at Columbia University, and\nhe co-authored Security Analysis with Ben Graham.\nFrom the\nmoment I arrived at Columbia, Dave personally encouraged and\neducated me; one influence was as important as the other.\nEverything he taught me, directly or through his book, made\nsense.\nLater, through dozens of letters, he continued my\neducation right up until his death.\nI have known many professors of finance and investments but\nI have never seen any, except for Ben Graham, who was the match\nof Dave.\nThe proof of his talent is the record of his students:\nNo other teacher of investments has sent forth so many who have\nachieved unusual success.\nWhen students left Daves classroom, they were equipped to\ninvest intelligently for a lifetime because the principles he\ntaught were simple, sound, useful, and enduring.\nThough these\nmay appear to be unremarkable virtues, the teaching of principles\nembodying them has been rare.\nIts particularly impressive that Dave could practice as\nwell as preach. just as Keynes became wealthy by applying his\nacademic ideas to a very small purse, so, too, did Dave.\nIndeed,\nhis financial performance far outshone that of Keynes, who began\nas a market-timer (leaning on business and credit-cycle theory)\nand converted, after much thought, to value investing.\nDave was\nright from the start.\nIn Berkshires investments, Charlie and I have employed the\nprinciples taught by Dave and Ben Graham.\nOur prosperity is the\nfruit of their intellectual tree.\nMiscellaneous\nWe hope to buy more businesses that are similar to the ones\nwe have, and we can use some help.\nIf you have a business that\nfits the following criteria, call me or, preferably, write.\nHeres what were looking for:\n(1) large purchases (at least $10 million of after-tax\nearnings),\n(2) demonstrated consistent earning power (future projections\nare of little interest to us, nor are turnaround\nsituations),\n(3) businesses earning good returns on equity while employing\nlittle or no debt,\n(4) management in place (we cant supply it),\n(5) simple businesses (if theres lots of technology, we wont\nunderstand it),\n(6) an offering price (we dont want to waste our time or that\nof the seller by talking, even preliminarily, about a\ntransaction when price is unknown).\nWe will not engage in unfriendly takeovers.\nWe can promise\ncomplete confidentiality and a very fast answer - customarily\nwithin five minutes - as to whether were interested.\nWe prefer\nto buy for cash, but will consider issuing stock when we receive\nas much in intrinsic business value as we give.\nOur favorite form of purchase is one fitting the Blumkin-\nFriedman-Heldman mold.\nIn cases like these, the companys owner-\nmanagers wish to generate significant amounts of cash, sometimes\nfor themselves, but often for their families or inactive\nshareholders.\nHowever, these managers also wish to remain\nsignificant owners who continue to run their companies just as\nthey have in the past.\nWe think we offer a particularly good fit\nfor owners with these objectives and invite potential sellers to\ncheck us out by contacting people with whom we have done business\nin the past.\nCharlie and I frequently get approached about acquisitions\nthat dont come close to meeting our tests: Weve found that if\nyou advertise an interest in buying collies, a lot of people will\ncall hoping to sell you their cocker spaniels.\nOur interest in\nnew ventures, turnarounds, or auction-like sales can best be\nexpressed by another Goldwynism: Please include me out.\nBesides being interested in the purchase of businesses as\ndescribed above, we are also interested in the negotiated\npurchase of large, but not controlling, blocks of stock\ncomparable to those we hold in Cap Cities and Salomon.\nWe have a\nspecial interest in purchasing convertible preferreds as a long-\nterm investment, as we did at Salomon.\n*\n*\n*\nWe received some good news a few weeks ago: Standard &\nPoors raised our credit rating to AAA, which is the highest\nrating it bestows.\nOnly 15 other U.S. industrial or property-\ncasualty companies are rated AAA, down from 28 in 1980.\nCorporate bondholders have taken their lumps in the past few\nyears from event risk. This term refers to the overnight\ndegradation of credit that accompanies a heavily-leveraged\npurchase or recapitalization of a business whose financial\npolicies, up to then, had been conservative.\nIn a world of\ntakeovers inhabited by few owner-managers, most corporations\npresent such a risk.\nBerkshire does not.\nCharlie and I promise\nbondholders the same respect we afford shareholders.\n*\n*\n*\nAbout 97.4% of all eligible shares participated in\nBerkshires 1988 shareholder-designated contributions program.\nContributions made through the program were $5 million, and 2,319\ncharities were recipients.\nIf we achieve reasonable business\nresults, we plan to increase the per-share contributions in 1989.\nWe urge new shareholders to read the description of our\nshareholder-designated contributions program that appears on\npages 48-49.\nIf you wish to participate in future programs, we\nstrongly urge that you immediately make sure your shares are\nregistered in the name of the actual owner, not in the nominee\nname of a broker, bank or depository.\nShares not so registered\non September 30, 1989 will be ineligible for the 1989 program.\n*\n*\n*\nBerkshires annual meeting will be held in Omaha on Monday,\nApril 24, 1989, and I hope you will come.\nThe meeting provides\nthe forum for you to ask any owner-related questions you may\nhave, and we will keep answering until all (except those dealing\nwith portfolio activities or other proprietary information) have\nbeen dealt with.\nAfter the meeting we will have several buses available to\ntake you to visit Mrs. B at The Nebraska Furniture Mart and Ike\nFriedman at Borsheims.\nBe prepared for bargains.\nOut-of-towners may prefer to arrive early and visit Mrs. B\nduring the Sunday store hours of noon to five. (These Sunday\nhours seem ridiculously short to Mrs. B, who feels they scarcely\nallow her time to warm up; she much prefers the days on which the\nstore remains open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.) Borsheims, however, is\nnot open on Sunday.\nAsk Mrs. B the secret of her astonishingly low carpet\nprices.\nShe will confide to you - as she does to everyone - how\nshe does it: I can sell so cheap cause I work for this dummy\nwho doesnt know anything about carpet.\nWarren E.

    "text": "Chairman's Letter - 1989\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOur gain in net worth during 1989 was $1.515 billion, or\n44.4%. Over the last 25 years (that is, since present management\ntook over) our per-share book value has grown from $19.46 to\n$4,296.01, or at a rate of 23.8% compounded annually.\nWhat counts, however, is intrinsic value - the figure\nindicating what all of our constituent businesses are rationally\nworth. With perfect foresight, this number can be calculated by\ntaking all future cash flows of a business - in and out - and\ndiscounting them at prevailing interest rates. So valued, all\nbusinesses, from manufacturers of buggy whips to operators of\ncellular phones, become economic equals.\nBack when Berkshire's book value was $19.46, intrinsic\nvalue was somewhat less because the book value was entirely tied\nup in a textile business not worth the figure at which it was\ncarried. Now most of our businesses are worth far more than their\ncarrying values. This agreeable evolution from a discount to a\npremium means that Berkshire's intrinsic business value has\ncompounded at a rate that somewhat exceeds our 23.8% annual\ngrowth in book value.\nThe rear-view mirror is one thing; the windshield is\nanother. A large portion of our book value is represented by\nequity securities that, with minor exceptions, are carried on our\nbalance sheet at current market values. At yearend these\nsecurities were valued at higher prices, relative to their own\nintrinsic business values, than has been the case in the past.\nOne reason is the buoyant 1989 stock market. More important, the\nvirtues of these businesses have been widely recognized. Whereas\nonce their stock prices were inappropriately low, they are not\nnow.\nWe will keep most of our major holdings, regardless of how\nthey are priced relative to intrinsic business value. This 'til-\ndeath-do-us-part attitude, combined with the full prices these\nholdings command, means that they cannot be expected to push up\nBerkshire's value in the future as sharply as in the past. In\nother words, our performance to date has benefited from a double-\ndip: (1) the exceptional gains in intrinsic value that our\nportfolio companies have achieved; (2) the additional bonus we\nrealized as the market appropriately \"corrected\" the prices of\nthese companies, raising their valuations in relation to those of\nthe average business. We will continue to benefit from good gains\nin business value that we feel confident our portfolio companies\nwill make. But our \"catch-up\" rewards have been realized, which\nmeans we'll have to settle for a single-dip in the future.\nWe face another obstacle: In a finite world, high growth\nrates must self-destruct. If the base from which the growth is\ntaking place is tiny, this law may not operate for a time. But\nwhen the base balloons, the party ends: A high growth rate\neventually forges its own anchor.\nCarl Sagan has entertainingly described this phenomenon,\nmusing about the destiny of bacteria that reproduce by dividing\ninto two every 15 minutes. Says Sagan: \"That means four doublings\nan hour, and 96 doublings a day. Although a bacterium weighs only\nabout a trillionth of a gram, its descendants, after a day of\nwild asexual abandon, will collectively weigh as much as a\nmountain...in two days, more than the sun - and before very long,\neverything in the universe will be made of bacteria.\" Not to\nworry, says Sagan:\nSome obstacle always impedes this kind of\nexponential growth. \"The bugs run out of food, or they poison\neach other, or they are shy about reproducing in public.\"\nEven on bad days, Charlie Munger (Berkshire's Vice Chairman\nand my partner) and I do not think of Berkshire as a bacterium.\nNor, to our unending sorrow, have we found a way to double its\nnet worth every 15 minutes. Furthermore, we are not the least bit\nshy about reproducing - financially - in public. Nevertheless,\nSagan's observations apply. From Berkshire's present base of $4.9\nbillion in net worth, we will find it much more difficult to\naverage 15% annual growth in book value than we did to average\n23.8% from the $22 million we began with.\nTaxes\nOur 1989 gain of $1.5 billion was achieved after we took a\ncharge of about $712 million for income taxes. In addition,\nBerkshire's share of the income taxes paid by its five major\ninvestees totaled about $175 million.\nOf this year's tax charge, about $172 million will be paid\ncurrently; the remainder, $540 million, is deferred. Almost all\nof the deferred portion relates to the 1989 increase in\nunrealized profits in our common stock holdings. Against this\nincrease, we have reserved a 34% tax.\nWe also carry reserves at that rate against all unrealized\nprofits generated in 1987 and 1988. But, as we explained last\nyear, the unrealized gains we amassed before 1987 - about $1.2\nbillion - carry reserves booked at the 28% tax rate that then\nprevailed.\nA new accounting rule is likely to be adopted that will\nrequire companies to reserve against all gains at the current tax\nrate, whatever it may be. With the rate at 34%, such a rule would\nincrease our deferred tax liability, and decrease our net worth,\nby about $71 million - the result of raising the reserve on our\npre-1987 gain by six percentage points. Because the proposed rule\nhas sparked widespread controversy and its final form is unclear,\nwe have not yet made this change.\nAs you can see from our balance sheet on page 27, we would\nowe taxes of more than $1.1 billion were we to sell all of our\nsecurities at year-end market values. Is this $1.1 billion\nliability equal, or even similar, to a $1.1 billion liability\npayable to a trade creditor 15 days after the end of the year?\nObviously not - despite the fact that both items have exactly the\nsame effect on audited net worth, reducing it by $1.1 billion.\nOn the other hand, is this liability for deferred taxes a\nmeaningless accounting fiction because its payment can be\ntriggered only by the sale of stocks that, in very large part, we\nhave no intention of selling?\nAgain, the answer is no.\nIn economic terms, the liability resembles an interest-free\nloan from the U.S. Treasury that comes due only at our election\n(unless, of course, Congress moves to tax gains before they are\nrealized). This \"loan\" is peculiar in other respects as well: It\ncan be used only to finance the ownership of the particular,\nappreciated stocks and it fluctuates in size - daily as market\nprices change and periodically if tax rates change. In effect,\nthis deferred tax liability is equivalent to a very large\ntransfer tax that is payable only if we elect to move from one\nasset to another. Indeed, we sold some relatively small holdings\nin 1989, incurring about $76 million of \"transfer\" tax on $224\nmillion of gains.\nBecause of the way the tax law works, the Rip Van Winkle\nstyle of investing that we favor - if successful - has an\nimportant mathematical edge over a more frenzied approach. Let's\nlook at an extreme comparison.\nImagine that Berkshire had only $1, which we put in a\nsecurity that doubled by yearend and was then sold. Imagine\nfurther that we used the after-tax proceeds to repeat this\nprocess in each of the next 19 years, scoring a double each time.\nAt the end of the 20 years, the 34% capital gains tax that we\nwould have paid on the profits from each sale would have\ndelivered about $13,000 to the government and we would be left\nwith about $25,250. Not bad. If, however, we made a single\nfantastic investment that itself doubled 20 times during the 20\nyears, our dollar would grow to $1,048,576. Were we then to cash\nout, we would pay a 34% tax of roughly $356,500 and be left with\nabout $692,000.\nThe sole reason for this staggering difference in results\nwould be the timing of tax payments. Interestingly, the\ngovernment would gain from Scenario 2 in exactly the same 27:1\nratio as we - taking in taxes of $356,500 vs. $13,000 - though,\nadmittedly, it would have to wait for its money.\nWe have not, we should stress, adopted our strategy\nfavoring long-term investment commitments because of these\nmathematics. Indeed, it is possible we could earn greater after-\ntax returns by moving rather frequently from one investment to\nanother. Many years ago, that's exactly what Charlie and I did.\nNow we would rather stay put, even if that means slightly\nlower returns. Our reason is simple: We have found splendid\nbusiness relationships to be so rare and so enjoyable that we\nwant to retain all we develop.\nThis decision is particularly\neasy for us because we feel that these relationships will produce\ngood - though perhaps not optimal - financial results.\nConsidering that, we think it makes little sense for us to give\nup time with people we know to be interesting and admirable for\ntime with others we do not know and who are likely to have human\nqualities far closer to average. That would be akin to marrying\nfor money - a mistake under most circumstances, insanity if one\nis already rich.\nSources of Reported Earnings\nThe table below shows the major sources of Berkshire's\nreported earnings. In this presentation, amortization of Goodwill\nand other major purchase-price accounting adjustments are not\ncharged against the specific businesses to which they apply, but\nare instead aggregated and shown separately. This procedure lets\nyou view the earnings of our businesses as they would have been\nreported had we not purchased them. I've explained in past\nreports why this form of presentation seems to us to be more\nuseful to investors and managers than one utilizing generally\naccepted accounting principles (GAAP), which require purchase-\nprice adjustments to be made on a business-by-business basis. The\ntotal net earnings we show in the table are, of course, identical\nto the GAAP total in our audited financial statements.\nFurther information about these businesses is given in the\nBusiness Segment section on pages 37-39, and in the Management's\nDiscussion section on pages 40-44. In these sections you also\nwill find our segment earnings reported on a GAAP basis. For\ninformation on Wesco's businesses, I urge you to read Charlie\nMunger's letter, which starts on page 54. In addition, we have\nreprinted on page 71 Charlie's May 30, 1989 letter to the U. S.\nLeague of Savings Institutions, which conveyed our disgust with\nits policies and our consequent decision to resign.\n(000s omitted)\n----------------------------------------------\nBerkshire's Share\nof Net Earnings\n(after taxes and\nPre-Tax Earnings\nminority interests)\n----------------------\n----------------------\n1989\n1988\n1989\n1988\n----------\n----------\n----------\n----------\nOperating Earnings:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting ............\n$(24,400)\n$(11,081)\n$(12,259)\n$ (1,045)\nNet Investment Income ...\n243,599\n231,250\n213,642\n197,779\nBuffalo News ..............\n46,047\n42,429\n27,771\n25,462\nFechheimer ................\n12,621\n14,152\n6,789\n7,720\nKirby .....................\n26,114\n26,891\n16,803\n17,842\nNebraska Furniture Mart ...\n17,070\n18,439\n8,441\n9,099\nScott Fetzer\nManufacturing Group ....\n33,165\n28,542\n19,996\n17,640\nSee's Candies .............\n34,235\n32,473\n20,626\n19,671\nWesco - other than Insurance\n13,008\n16,133\n9,810\n10,650\nWorld Book ................\n25,583\n27,890\n16,372\n18,021\nAmortization of Goodwill ..\n(3,387)\n(2,806)\n(3,372)\n(2,806)\nOther Purchase-Price\nAccounting Charges ........\n(5,740)\n(6,342)\n(6,668)\n(7,340)\nInterest Expense* .........\n(42,389)\n(35,613)\n(27,098)\n(23,212)\nShareholder-Designated\nContributions ..........\n(5,867)\n(4,966)\n(3,814)\n(3,217)\nOther .....................\n23,755\n41,059\n12,863\n27,177\n----------\n----------\n----------\n----------\nOperating Earnings ..........\n393,414\n418,450\n299,902\n313,441\nSales of Securities .........\n223,810\n131,671\n147,575\n85,829\n----------\n----------\n----------\n----------\nTotal Earnings - All Entities\n$617,224\n$550,121\n$447,477\n$399,270\n*Excludes interest expense of Scott Fetzer Financial Group and\nMutual Savings & Loan.\nWe refer you also to pages 45-51, where we have rearranged\nBerkshire's financial data into four segments. These correspond\nto the way Charlie and I think about the business and should help\nyou calculate Berkshire's intrinsic value. Shown on these pages\nare balance sheets and earnings statements for:\n(1) our\ninsurance operations, with their major investment positions\nitemized; (2) our manufacturing, publishing and retailing\nbusinesses, leaving aside certain non-operating assets and\npurchase-price accounting adjustments; (3) our subsidiaries\nengaged in finance-type operations, which are Mutual Savings and\nScott Fetzer Financial; and (4) an all-other category that\nincludes the non-operating assets (primarily marketable\nsecurities) held by the companies in segment (2), all purchase\nprice accounting adjustments, and various assets and debts of the\nWesco and Berkshire parent companies.\nIf you combine the earnings and net worths of these four\nsegments, you will derive totals matching those shown on our GAAP\nstatements. However, I want to emphasize that this four-category\npresentation does not fall within the purview of our auditors,\nwho in no way bless it.\nIn addition to our reported earnings, we also benefit from\nsignificant earnings of investees that standard accounting rules\ndo not permit us to report. On page 15, we list five major\ninvestees from which we received dividends in 1989 of about $45\nmillion, after taxes. However, our share of the retained earnings\nof these investees totaled about $212 million last year, not\ncounting large capital gains realized by GEICO and Coca-Cola. If\nthis $212 million had been distributed to us, our own operating\nearnings, after the payment of additional taxes, would have been\nclose to $500 million rather than the $300 million shown in the\ntable.\nThe question you must decide is whether these undistributed\nearnings are as valuable to us as those we report. We believe\nthey are - and even think they may be more valuable. The reason\nfor this a-bird-in-the-bush-may-be-worth-two-in-the-hand\nconclusion is that earnings retained\nby these\ninvestees will\nbe deployed\nby talented,\nowner-oriented\nmanagers\nwho\nsometimes have better uses for these funds in their own\nbusinesses than we would have in ours. I would not make such a\ngenerous assessment of most managements, but it is appropriate in\nthese cases.\nIn our view, Berkshire's fundamental earning power is best\nmeasured by a \"look-through\" approach, in which we append our\nshare of the operating earnings retained by our investees to our\nown reported operating earnings, excluding capital gains in both\ninstances. For our intrinsic business value to grow at an average\nof 15% per year, our \"look-through\" earnings must grow at about\nthe same pace. We'll need plenty of help from our present\ninvestees, and also need to add a new one from time to time, in\norder to reach this 15% goal.\nNon-Insurance Operations\nIn the past, we have labeled our major manufacturing,\npublishing and retail operations \"The Sainted Seven.\" With our\nacquisition of Borsheim's early in 1989, the challenge was to\nfind a new title both alliterative and appropriate. We failed:\nLet's call the group \"The Sainted Seven Plus One.\"\nThis divine assemblage - Borsheim's, The Buffalo News,\nFechheimer Bros., Kirby, Nebraska Furniture Mart, Scott Fetzer\nManufacturing Group, See's Candies, World Book - is a collection\nof businesses with economic characteristics that range from good\nto superb. Its managers range from superb to superb.\nMost of these managers have no need to work for a living;\nthey show up at the ballpark because they like to hit home runs.\nAnd that's exactly what they do. Their combined financial\nstatements (including those of some smaller operations), shown on\npage 49, illustrate just how outstanding their performance is. On\nan historical accounting basis, after-tax earnings of these\noperations were 57% on average equity capital. Moreover, this\nreturn was achieved with no net leverage: Cash equivalents have\nmatched funded debt. When I call off the names of our managers -\nthe Blumkin, Friedman and Heldman families, Chuck Huggins, Stan\nLipsey, and Ralph Schey - I feel the same glow that Miller\nHuggins must have experienced when he announced the lineup of his\n1927 New York Yankees.\nLet's take a look, business by business:\no\nIn its first year with Berkshire, Borsheim's met all\nexpectations. Sales rose significantly and are now considerably\nbetter than twice what they were four years ago when the company\nmoved to its present location. In the six years prior to the\nmove, sales had also doubled. Ike Friedman, Borsheim's managing\ngenius - and I mean that - has only one speed: fast-forward.\nIf you haven't been there, you've never seen a jewelry store\nlike Borsheim's. Because of the huge volume it does at one\nlocation, the store can maintain an enormous selection across all\nprice ranges. For the same reason, it can hold its expense ratio\nto about one-third that prevailing at jewelry stores offering\ncomparable merchandise. The store's tight control of expenses,\naccompanied by its unusual buying power, enable it to offer\nprices far lower than those of other jewelers. These prices, in\nturn, generate even more volume, and so the circle goes 'round\nand 'round. The end result is store traffic as high as 4,000\npeople on seasonally-busy days.\nIke Friedman is not only a superb businessman and a great\nshowman but also a man of integrity. We bought the business\nwithout an audit, and all of our surprises have been on the plus\nside. \"If you don't know jewelry, know your jeweler\" makes sense\nwhether you are buying the whole business or a tiny diamond.\nA story will illustrate why I enjoy Ike so much: Every two\nyears I'm part of an informal group that gathers to have fun and\nexplore a few subjects. Last September, meeting at Bishop's Lodge\nin Santa Fe, we asked Ike, his wife Roz, and his son Alan to come\nby and educate us on jewels and the jewelry business.\nIke decided to dazzle the group, so he brought from Omaha\nabout $20 million of particularly fancy merchandise. I was\nsomewhat apprehensive - Bishop's Lodge is no Fort Knox - and I\nmentioned my concern to Ike at our opening party the evening\nbefore his presentation. Ike took me aside. \"See that safe?\" he\nsaid. \"This afternoon we changed the combination and now even the\nhotel management doesn't know what it is.\" I breathed easier. Ike\nwent on: \"See those two big fellows with guns on their hips?\nThey'll be guarding the safe all night.\" I now was ready to\nrejoin the party. But Ike leaned closer: \"And besides, Warren,\"\nhe confided, \"the jewels aren't in the safe.\"\nHow can we miss with a fellow like that - particularly when\nhe comes equipped with a talented and energetic family, Alan,\nMarvin Cohn, and Don Yale.\no\nAt See's Candies we had an 8% increase in pounds sold, even\nthough 1988 was itself a record year. Included in the 1989\nperformance were excellent same-store poundage gains, our first\nin many years.\nAdvertising played an important role in this outstanding\nperformance. We increased total advertising expenditures from $4\nmillion to $5 million and also got copy from our agency, Hal\nRiney & Partners, Inc., that was 100% on the money in conveying\nthe qualities that make See's special.\nIn our media businesses, such as the Buffalo News, we sell\nadvertising. In other businesses, such as See's, we are buyers.\nWhen we buy, we practice exactly what we preach when we sell. At\nSee's, we more than tripled our expenditures on newspaper\nadvertising last year, to the highest percentage of sales that I\ncan remember. The payoff was terrific, and we thank both Hal\nRiney and the power of well-directed newspaper advertising for\nthis result.\nSee's splendid performances have become routine. But there\nis nothing routine about the management of Chuck Huggins: His\ndaily involvement with all aspects of production and sales\nimparts a quality-and-service message to the thousands of\nemployees we need to produce and distribute over 27 million\npounds of candy annually. In a company with 225 shops and a\nmassive mail order and phone business, it is no small trick to\nrun things so that virtually every customer leaves happy. Chuck\nmakes it look easy.\no\nThe Nebraska Furniture Mart had record sales and excellent\nearnings in 1989, but there was one sad note. Mrs. B - Rose\nBlumkin, who started the company 52 years ago with $500 - quit in\nMay, after disagreeing with other members of the Blumkin\nfamily/management about the remodeling and operation of the\ncarpet department.\nMrs. B probably has made more smart business decisions than\nany living American, but in this particular case I believe the\nother members of the family were entirely correct: Over the past\nthree years, while the store's other departments increased sales\nby 24%, carpet sales declined by 17% (but not because of any lack\nof sales ability by Mrs. B, who has always personally sold far\nmore merchandise than any other salesperson in the store).\nYou will be pleased to know that Mrs. B continues to make\nHoratio Alger's heroes look like victims of tired blood. At age\n96 she has started a new business selling - what else? - carpet\nand furniture. And as always, she works seven days a week.\nAt the Mart Louie, Ron, and Irv Blumkin continue to propel\nwhat is by far the largest and most successful home furnishings\nstore in the country. They are outstanding merchants, outstanding\nmanagers, and a joy to be associated with. One reading on their\nacumen: In the fourth quarter of 1989, the carpet department\nregistered a 75.3% consumer share in the Omaha market, up from\n67.7% a year earlier and over six times that of its nearest\ncompetitor.\nNFM and Borsheim's follow precisely the same formula for\nsuccess: (1) unparalleled depth and breadth of merchandise at one\nlocation; (2) the lowest operating costs in the business; (3) the\nshrewdest of buying, made possible in part by the huge volumes\npurchased; (4) gross margins, and therefore prices, far below\ncompetitors'; and (5) friendly personalized service with family\nmembers on hand at all times.\nAnother plug for newspapers: NFM increased its linage in the\nlocal paper by over 20% in 1989 - off a record 1988 - and remains\nthe paper's largest ROP advertiser by far. (ROP advertising is\nthe kind printed in the paper, as opposed to that in preprinted\ninserts.) To my knowledge, Omaha is the only city in which a home\nfurnishings store is the advertising leader. Many retailers cut\nspace purchases in 1989; our experience at See's and NFM would\nindicate they made a major mistake.\no\nThe Buffalo News continued to star in 1989 in three\nimportant ways: First, among major metropolitan papers, both\ndaily and Sunday, the News is number one in household penetration\n- the percentage of local households that purchase it each day.\nSecond, in \"news hole\" - the portion of the paper devoted to news\n- the paper stood at 50.1% in 1989 vs. 49.5% in 1988, a level\nagain making it more news-rich than any comparable American\npaper. Third, in a year that saw profits slip at many major\npapers, the News set its seventh consecutive profit record.\nTo some extent, these three factors are related, though\nobviously a high-percentage news hole, by itself, reduces profits\nsignificantly. A large and intelligently-utilized news hole,\nhowever, attracts a wide spectrum of readers and thereby boosts\npenetration. High penetration, in turn, makes a newspaper\nparticularly valuable to retailers since it allows them to talk\nto the entire community through a single \"megaphone.\" A low-\npenetration paper is a far less compelling purchase for many\nadvertisers and will eventually suffer in both ad rates and\nprofits.\nIt should be emphasized that our excellent penetration is\nneither an accident nor automatic. The population of Erie County,\nhome territory of the News, has been falling - from 1,113,000 in\n1970 to 1,015,000 in 1980 to an estimated 966,000 in 1988.\nCirculation figures tell a different story. In 1975, shortly\nbefore we started our Sunday edition, the Courier-Express, a\nlong-established Buffalo paper, was selling 207,500 Sunday copies\nin Erie County. Last year - with population at least 5% lower -\nthe News sold an average of 292,700 copies. I believe that in no\nother major Sunday market has there been anything close to that\nincrease in penetration.\nWhen this kind of gain is made - and when a paper attains an\nunequaled degree of acceptance in its home town - someone is\ndoing something right. In this case major credit clearly belongs\nto Murray Light, our long-time editor who daily creates an\ninformative, useful, and interesting product. Credit should go\nalso to the Circulation and Production Departments: A paper that\nis frequently late, because of production problems or\ndistribution weaknesses, will lose customers, no matter how\nstrong its editorial content.\nStan Lipsey, publisher of the News, has produced profits\nfully up to the strength of our product. I believe Stan's\nmanagerial skills deliver at least five extra percentage points\nin profit margin compared to the earnings that would be achieved\nby an average manager given the same circumstances. That is an\namazing performance, and one that could only be produced by a\ntalented manager who knows - and cares - about every nut and bolt\nof the business.\nStan's knowledge and talents, it should be emphasized,\nextend to the editorial product. His early years in the business\nwere spent on the news side and he played a key role in\ndeveloping and editing a series of stories that in 1972 won a\nPulitzer Prize for the Sun Newspaper of Omaha. Stan and I have\nworked together for over 20 years, through some bad times as well\nas good, and I could not ask for a better partner.\no\nAt Fechheimer, the Heldman clan - Bob, George, Gary,\nRoger and Fred - continue their extraordinary performance. Profits\nin 1989 were down somewhat because of problems the business\nexperienced in integrating a major 1988 acquisition. These\nproblems will be ironed out in time. Meanwhile, return on invested\ncapital at Fechheimer remains splendid.\nLike all of our managers, the Heldmans have an exceptional\ncommand of the details of their business. At last year's annual\nmeeting I mentioned that when a prisoner enters San Quentin, Bob\nand George probably know his shirt size. That's only a slight\nexaggeration: No matter what area of the country is being\ndiscussed, they know exactly what is going on with major\ncustomers and with the competition.\nThough we purchased Fechheimer four years ago, Charlie and I\nhave never visited any of its plants or the home office in\nCincinnati. We're much like the lonesome Maytag repairman: The\nHeldman managerial product is so good that a service call is\nnever needed.\no\nRalph Schey continues to do a superb job in managing\nour largest group - World Book, Kirby, and the Scott Fetzer\nManufacturing Companies. Aggregate earnings of these businesses\nhave increased every year since our purchase and returns on\ninvested capital continue to be exceptional. Ralph is running an\nenterprise large enough, were it standing alone, to be on the\nFortune 500. And he's running it in a fashion that would put him\nhigh in the top decile, measured by return on equity.\nFor some years, World Book has operated out of a single\nlocation in Chicago's Merchandise Mart. Anticipating the imminent\nexpiration of its lease, the business is now decentralizing into\nfour locations. The expenses of this transition are significant;\nnevertheless profits in 1989 held up well. It will be another\nyear before costs of the move are fully behind us.\nKirby's business was particularly strong last year,\nfeaturing large gains in export sales. International business has\nmore than doubled in the last two years and quintupled in the\npast four; its share of unit sales has risen from 5% to 20%. Our\nlargest capital expenditures in 1989 were at Kirby, in\npreparation for a major model change in 1990.\nRalph's operations contribute about 40% of the total\nearnings of the non-insurance group whose results are shown on\npage 49. When we bought Scott Fetzer at the start of 1986, our\nacquisition of Ralph as a manager was fully as important as our\nacquisition of the businesses. In addition to generating\nextraordinary earnings, Ralph also manages capital extremely\nwell. These abilities have produced funds for Berkshire that, in\nturn, have allowed us to make many other profitable commitments.\nAnd that completes our answer to the 1927 Yankees.\nInsurance Operations\nShown below is an updated version of our usual table\npresenting key figures for the property-casualty insurance\nindustry:\nStatutory\nYearly Change\nCombined Ratio\nYearly Change\nInflation Rate\nin Premiums\nAfter Policyholder\nin Incurred\nMeasured by\nWritten (%)\nDividends\nLosses (%)\nGNP Deflator (%)\n-------------\n------------------\n-------------\n----------------\n1981\n3.8\n106.0\n6.5\n9.6\n1982\n3.7\n109.6\n8.4\n6.5\n1983\n5.0\n112.0\n6.8\n3.8\n1984\n8.5\n118.0\n16.9\n3.8\n1985\n22.1\n116.3\n16.1\n3.0\n1986\n22.2\n108.0\n13.5\n2.6\n1987\n9.4\n104.6\n7.8\n3.1\n1988\n4.4\n105.4\n5.5\n3.3\n1989 (Est.)\n2.1\n110.4\n8.7\n4.2\nSource: A.M. Best Co.\nThe combined ratio represents total insurance costs (losses\nincurred plus expenses) compared to revenue from premiums: A\nratio below 100 indicates an underwriting profit, and one above\n100 indicates a loss. When the investment income that an insurer\nearns from holding policyholders' funds (\"the float\") is taken\ninto account, a combined ratio in the 107-111 range typically\nproduces an overall breakeven result, exclusive of earnings on\nthe funds provided by shareholders.\nFor the reasons laid out in previous reports, we expect the\nindustry's incurred losses to grow by about 10% annually, even in\nyears when general inflation runs considerably lower. (Actually,\nover\nthe last 25 years, incurred\nlosses have\ngrown at a still\nfaster rate, 11%.) If premium growth meanwhile materially lags\nthat 10% rate, underwriting losses will mount, though the\nindustry's tendency to underreserve when business turns bad may\nobscure their size for a time.\nLast year we said the climb in the combined ratio was\n\"almost certain to continue - and probably will accelerate - for\nat least two more years.\" This year we will not predict\nacceleration, but otherwise must repeat last year's forecast.\nPremium growth is running far below the 10% required annually.\nRemember also that a 10% rate would only stabilize the combined\nratio, not bring it down.\nThe increase in the combined ratio in 1989 was a little more\nthan we had expected because catastrophes (led by Hurricane Hugo)\nwere unusually severe. These abnormalities probably accounted for\nabout two points of the increase. If 1990 is more of a \"normal\"\nyear, the combined ratio should rise only minimally from the\ncatastrophe-swollen base of 1989. In 1991, though, the ratio is\napt to climb by a greater degree.\nCommentators frequently discuss the \"underwriting cycle\" and\nspeculate about its next turn. If that term is used to connote\nrhythmic qualities, it is in our view a misnomer that leads to\nfaulty thinking about the industry's fundamental economics.\nThe term was appropriate some decades ago when the industry\nand regulators cooperated\nto conduct the\nbusiness\nin cartel\nfashion. At that\ntime, the combined ratio fluctuated\nrhythmically for two reasons, both related to lags. First, data\nfrom the past were analyzed and then used to set new \"corrected\"\nrates, which were subsequently put into effect by virtually all\ninsurers. Second, the fact that almost all policies were then\nissued for a one-to three-year term - which meant that it took a\nconsiderable time for mispriced policies to expire - delayed the\nimpact of new rates on revenues. These two lagged responses made\ncombined ratios behave much like alternating current. Meanwhile,\nthe absence of significant price competition guaranteed that\nindustry profits, averaged out over the cycle, would be\nsatisfactory.\nThe cartel period is long gone. Now the industry has\nhundreds of participants selling a commodity-like product at\nindependently-established prices. Such a configuration - whether\nthe product being sold is steel or insurance policies - is\ncertain to cause subnormal profitability in all circumstances but\none: a shortage of usable capacity. Just how often these periods\noccur and how long they last determines the average profitability\nof the industry in question.\nIn most industries, capacity is described in physical terms.\nIn the insurance world, however, capacity is customarily\ndescribed in financial terms; that is, it's considered\nappropriate for a company to write no more than X dollars of\nbusiness if it has Y dollars of net worth. In practice, however,\nconstraints of this sort have proven ineffective. Regulators,\ninsurance brokers, and customers are all slow to discipline\ncompanies that strain their resources. They also acquiesce when\ncompanies grossly overstate their true capital. Hence, a company\ncan write a great deal of business with very little capital if it\nis so inclined. At bottom, therefore, the amount of industry\ncapacity at any particular moment primarily depends on the mental\nstate of insurance managers.\nAll this understood, it is not very difficult to\nprognosticate the industry's profits. Good profits will be\nrealized only when there is a shortage of capacity. Shortages\nwill occur only when insurers are frightened. That happens rarely\n- and most assuredly is not happening now.\nSome analysts have argued that the more onerous taxes\nrecently imposed on the insurance industry and 1989's\ncatastrophes - Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake -\nwill cause prices to strengthen significantly. We disagree. These\nadversities have not destroyed the eagerness of insurers to write\nbusiness at present prices. Therefore, premium volume won't grow\nby 10% in 1990, which means the negative underwriting trend will\nnot reverse.\nThe industry will meantime say it needs higher prices to\nachieve profitability matching that of the average American\nbusiness. Of course it does. So does the steel business. But\nneeds and desires have nothing to do with the long-term\nprofitability of industries. Instead, economic fundamentals\ndetermine the outcome. Insurance profitability will improve only\nwhen virtually all insurers are turning away business despite\nhigher prices. And we're a long way from that point.\nBerkshire's premium volume may drop to $150 million or so in\n1990 (from a high of $1 billion in 1986), partly because our\ntraditional business continues to shrink and partly because the\ncontract under which we received 7% of the business of Fireman's\nFund expired last August. Whatever the size of the drop, it will\nnot disturb us. We have no interest in writing insurance that\ncarries a mathematical expectation of loss; we experience enough\ndisappointments doing transactions we believe to carry an\nexpectation of profit.\nHowever, our appetite for appropriately-priced business is\nample, as one tale from 1989 will tell. It concerns \"CAT covers,\"\nwhich are reinsurance contracts that primary insurance companies\n(and also reinsurers themselves) buy to protect themselves\nagainst a single catastrophe, such as a tornado or hurricane,\nthat produces losses from a large number of policies. In these\ncontracts, the primary insurer might retain the loss from a\nsingle event up to a maximum of, say, $10 million, buying various\nlayers of reinsurance above that level. When losses exceed the\nretained amount, the reinsurer typically pays 95% of the excess\nup to its contractual limit, with the primary insurer paying the\nremainder. (By requiring the primary insurer to keep 5% of each\nlayer, the reinsurer leaves him with a financial stake in each\nloss settlement and guards against his throwing away the\nreinsurer's money.)\nCAT covers are usually one-year policies that also provide\nfor one automatic reinstatement, which requires a primary insurer\nwhose coverage has been exhausted by a catastrophe to buy a\nsecond cover for the balance of the year in question by paying\nanother premium. This provision protects the primary company from\nbeing \"bare\" for even a brief period after a first catastrophic\nevent. The duration of \"an event\" is usually limited by contract\nto any span of 72 hours designated by the primary company. Under\nthis definition, a wide-spread storm, causing damage for three\ndays, will be classified as a single event if it arises from a\nsingle climatic cause. If the storm lasts four days, however, the\nprimary company will file a claim carving out the 72 consecutive\nhours during which it suffered the greatest damage. Losses that\noccurred outside that period will be treated as arising from a\nseparate event.\nIn 1989, two unusual things happened. First, Hurricane Hugo\ngenerated $4 billion or more of insured loss, at a pace, however,\nthat caused the vast damage in the Carolinas to occur slightly\nmore than 72 hours after the equally severe damage in the\nCaribbean. Second, the California earthquake hit within weeks,\ncausing insured damage that was difficult to estimate, even well\nafter the event. Slammed by these two - or possibly three - major\ncatastrophes, some primary insurers, and also many reinsurers\nthat had themselves bought CAT protection, either used up their\nautomatic second cover or became uncertain as to whether they had\ndone so.\nAt that point sellers of CAT policies had lost a huge amount\nof money - perhaps twice because of the reinstatements - and not\ntaken in much in premiums. Depending upon many\nvariables, a CAT\npremium\nmight generally have run 3% to 15% of the amount of\nprotection purchased. For some years, we've thought premiums of\nthat kind inadequate and have stayed away from the business.\nBut because the 1989 disasters left many insurers either\nactually or possibly bare, and also left most CAT writers licking\ntheir wounds, there was an immediate shortage after the\nearthquake of much-needed catastrophe coverage. Prices instantly\nbecame attractive, particularly for the reinsurance that CAT\nwriters themselves buy. Just as instantly, Berkshire Hathaway\noffered to write up to $250 million of catastrophe coverage,\nadvertising that proposition in trade publications. Though we did\nnot write all the business we sought, we did in a busy ten days\nbook a substantial amount.\nOur willingness to put such a huge sum on the line for a\nloss that could occur tomorrow sets us apart from any reinsurer\nin the world. There are, of course, companies that sometimes\nwrite $250 million or even far more of catastrophe coverage. But\nthey do so only when they can, in turn, reinsure a large\npercentage of the business with other companies. When they can't\n\"lay off\" in size, they disappear from the market.\nBerkshire's policy, conversely, is to retain the business we\nwrite rather than lay it off. When rates carry an expectation of\nprofit, we want to assume as much risk as is prudent. And in our\ncase, that's a lot.\nWe will accept more reinsurance risk for our own account\nthan any other company because of two factors: (1) by the\nstandards of regulatory accounting, we have a net worth in our\ninsurance companies of about $6 billion - the second highest\namount in the United States; and (2) we simply don't care what\nearnings we report quarterly, or even annually, just as long as\nthe decisions leading to those earnings (or losses) were reached\nintelligently.\nObviously, if we write $250 million of catastrophe coverage\nand retain it all ourselves, there is some probability that we\nwill lose the full $250 million in a single quarter. That\nprobability is low, but it is not zero. If we had a loss of that\nmagnitude, our after-tax cost would be about $165 million. Though\nthat is far more than Berkshire normally earns in a quarter, the\ndamage would be a blow only to our pride, not to our well-being.\nThis posture is one few insurance managements will assume.\nTypically, they are willing to write scads of business on terms\nthat almost guarantee them mediocre returns on equity. But they\ndo not want to expose themselves to an embarrassing single-\nquarter loss, even if the managerial strategy that causes the\nloss promises, over time, to produce superior results. I can\nunderstand their thinking: What is best for their owners is not\nnecessarily best for the managers. Fortunately Charlie and I have\nboth total job security and financial interests that are\nidentical with those of our shareholders. We are willing to look\nfoolish as long as we don't feel we have acted foolishly.\nOur method of operation, incidentally, makes us a\nstabilizing force in the industry. We add huge capacity when\ncapacity is short and we become less competitive only when\ncapacity is abundant. Of course, we don't follow this policy in\nthe interest of stabilization - we follow it because we believe\nit to be the most sensible and profitable course of action.\nNevertheless, our behavior steadies the\nmarket. In\nthis case,\nAdam\nSmith's\ninvisible\nhand works as advertised.\nCurrently, we hold an exceptional amount of float compared\nto premium volume. This circumstance should produce quite\nfavorable insurance results for us during the next few years as\nit did in 1989. Our underwriting losses should be tolerable and\nour investment income from policyholder funds large. This\npleasant situation, however, will gradually deteriorate as our\nfloat runs off.\nAt some point, however, there will be an opportunity for us\nto write large amounts of profitable business. Mike Goldberg and\nhis management team of Rod Eldred, Dinos Iordanou, Ajit Jain,\nPhil Urban, and Don Wurster continue to position us well for this\neventuality.\nMarketable Securities\nIn selecting marketable securities for our insurance\ncompanies, we generally choose among five major categories: (1)\nlong-term common stock investments, (2) medium-term fixed income\nsecurities, (3) long-term fixed income securities, (4) short-term\ncash equivalents, and (5) short-term arbitrage commitments.\nWe have no particular bias when it comes to choosing from\nthese categories; we just continuously search among them for the\nhighest after-tax returns as measured by \"mathematical\nexpectation,\" limiting ourselves always to investment\nalternatives we think we understand. Our criteria have nothing to\ndo with maximizing immediately reportable earnings; our goal,\nrather, is to maximize eventual net worth.\no\nBelow we list our common stock holdings having a value\nof over $100 million. A small portion of these investments belongs\nto subsidiaries of which Berkshire owns less than 100%.\n12/31/89\nShares\nCompany\nCost\nMarket\n------\n-------\n----------\n----------\n(000s omitted)\n3,000,000\nCapital Cities/ABC, Inc. ................ $\n517,500\n$1,692,375\n23,350,000\nThe Coca-Cola Co. .......................\n1,023,920\n1,803,787\n2,400,000\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. ........\n71,729\n161,100\n6,850,000\nGEICO Corp. .............................\n45,713\n1,044,625\n1,727,765\nThe Washington Post Company .............\n9,731\n486,366\nThis list of companies is the same as last year's and in\nonly one case has the number of shares changed: Our holdings of\nCoca-Cola increased from 14,172,500 shares at the end of 1988 to\n23,350,000.\nThis Coca-Cola investment provides yet another example of\nthe incredible speed with which your Chairman responds to\ninvestment opportunities, no matter how obscure or well-disguised\nthey may be. I believe I had my first Coca-Cola in either 1935 or\n1936. Of a certainty, it was in 1936 that I started buying Cokes\nat the rate of six for 25 cents from Buffett & Son, the family\ngrocery store, to sell around the neighborhood for 5 cents each.\nIn this excursion into high-margin retailing, I duly observed\nthe extraordinary consumer attractiveness and commercial\npossibilities of the product.\nI continued to note these qualities for the next 52 years as\nCoke blanketed the world. During this period, however, I\ncarefully avoided buying even a single share, instead allocating\nmajor portions of my net worth to street railway companies,\nwindmill manufacturers, anthracite producers, textile businesses,\ntrading-stamp issuers, and the like. (If you think I'm making\nthis up, I can supply the names.) Only in the summer of 1988 did\nmy brain finally establish contact with my eyes.\nWhat I then perceived was both clear and fascinating. After\ndrifting somewhat in the 1970's, Coca-Cola had in 1981 become a\nnew company with the move of Roberto Goizueta to CEO. Roberto,\nalong with Don Keough, once my across-the-street neighbor in\nOmaha, first rethought and focused the company's policies and\nthen energetically carried them out. What was already the world's\nmost ubiquitous product gained new momentum, with sales overseas\nvirtually exploding.\nThrough a truly rare blend of marketing and financial\nskills, Roberto has maximized both the growth of his product and\nthe rewards that this growth brings to shareholders. Normally,\nthe CEO of a consumer products company, drawing on his natural\ninclinations or experience, will cause either marketing or\nfinance to dominate the business at the expense of the other\ndiscipline. With Roberto, the mesh of marketing and finance is\nperfect and the result is a shareholder's dream.\nOf course, we should have started buying Coke much earlier,\nsoon after Roberto and Don began running things. In fact, if I\nhad been thinking straight I would have persuaded my grandfather\nto sell the grocery store back in 1936 and put all of the\nproceeds into Coca-Cola stock. I've learned my lesson: My\nresponse time to the next glaringly attractive idea will be\nslashed to well under 50 years.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the yearend prices of our major\ninvestees were much higher relative to their intrinsic values\nthan theretofore. While those prices may not yet cause\nnosebleeds, they are clearly vulnerable to a general market\ndecline. A drop in their prices would not disturb us at all - it\nmight in fact work to our eventual benefit - but it would cause\nat least a one-year reduction in Berkshire's net worth. We think\nsuch a reduction is almost certain in at least one of the next\nthree years. Indeed, it would take only about a 10% year-to-year\ndecline in the aggregate value of our portfolio investments to\nsend Berkshire's net worth down.\nWe continue to be blessed with extraordinary managers at our\nportfolio companies. They are high-grade, talented, and\nshareholder-oriented. The exceptional results we have achieved\nwhile investing with them accurately reflect their exceptional\npersonal qualities.\no\nWe told you last year that we expected to do little in\narbitrage during 1989, and that's the way it turned out.\nArbitrage positions are a substitute for short-term cash\nequivalents, and during part of the year we held relatively low\nlevels of cash. In the rest of the year we had a fairly good-\nsized cash position and even so chose not to engage in arbitrage.\nThe main reason was corporate transactions that made no economic\nsense to us; arbitraging such deals comes too close to playing\nthe greater-fool game. (As Wall Streeter Ray DeVoe says: \"Fools\nrush in where angels fear to trade.\") We will engage in arbitrage\nfrom time to time - sometimes on a large scale - but only when we\nlike the odds.\no\nLeaving aside the three convertible preferreds discussed in\nthe next section, we substantially reduced our holdings in both\nmedium- and long-term fixed-income securities. In the long-terms,\njust about our only holdings have been Washington Public Power\nSupply Systems (WPPSS) bonds carrying coupons ranging from low to\nhigh. During the year we sold a number of the low-coupon issues,\nwhich we originally bought at very large discounts. Many of these\nissues had approximately doubled in price since we purchased them\nand in addition had paid us 15%-17% annually, tax-free. Our\nprices upon sale were only slightly cheaper than typical high-\ngrade tax-exempts then commanded. We have kept all of our high-\ncoupon WPPSS issues. Some have been called for redemption in 1991\nand 1992, and we expect the rest to be called in the early to\nmid-1990s.\nWe also sold many of our medium-term tax-exempt bonds during\nthe year. When we bought these bonds we said we would be happy to\nsell them - regardless of whether they were higher or lower than\nat our time of purchase - if something we liked better came\nalong. Something did - and concurrently we unloaded most of these\nissues at modest gains. Overall, our 1989 profit from the sale of\ntax-exempt bonds was about $51 million pre-tax.\no\nThe proceeds from our bond sales, along with our excess cash\nat the beginning of the year and that generated later through\nearnings, went into the purchase of three convertible preferred\nstocks. In the first transaction, which took place in July, we\npurchased $600 million of The Gillette Co. preferred with an 8\n3/4% dividend, a mandatory redemption in ten years, and the right\nto convert into common at $50 per share. We next purchased $358\nmillion of USAir Group, Inc. preferred stock with mandatory\nredemption in ten years, a dividend of 9 1/4%, and the right to\nconvert into common at $60 per share. Finally, late in the year\nwe purchased $300 million of Champion International Corp.\npreferred with mandatory redemption in ten years, a 9 1/4%\ndividend, and the right to convert into common at $38 per share.\nUnlike standard convertible preferred stocks, the issues we\nown are either non-salable or non-convertible for considerable\nperiods of time and there is consequently no way we can gain from\nshort-term price blips in the common stock. I have gone on the\nboard of Gillette, but I am not on the board of USAir or\nChampion. (I thoroughly enjoy the boards I am on, but can't\nhandle any more.)\nGillette's business is very much the kind we like. Charlie\nand I think we understand the company's economics and therefore\nbelieve we can make a reasonably intelligent guess about its\nfuture. (If you haven't tried Gillette's new Sensor razor, go\nright out and get one.) However, we have no ability to forecast\nthe economics of the investment banking business (in which we\nhave a position through our 1987 purchase of Salomon convertible\npreferred), the airline industry, or the paper industry. This\ndoes not mean that we predict a negative\nfuture for these\nindustries: we're\nagnostics, not\natheists. Our\nlack of\nstrong\nconvictions about these businesses, however, means that we must\nstructure our investments in them differently from what we do\nwhen we invest in a business appearing to have splendid economic\ncharacteristics.\nIn one major respect, however, these purchases are not\ndifferent: We only want to link up with people whom we like,\nadmire, and trust. John Gutfreund at Salomon, Colman Mockler, Jr.\nat Gillette, Ed Colodny at USAir, and Andy Sigler at Champion\nmeet this test in spades.\nThey in turn have demonstrated some confidence in us,\ninsisting in each case that our preferreds have unrestricted\nvoting rights on a fully-converted basis, an arrangement that is\nfar from standard in corporate finance. In effect they are\ntrusting us to be intelligent owners, thinking about tomorrow\ninstead of today, just as we are trusting them to be intelligent\nmanagers, thinking about tomorrow as well as today.\nThe preferred-stock structures we have negotiated will\nprovide a mediocre return for us if industry economics hinder the\nperformance of our investees, but will produce reasonably\nattractive results for us if they can earn a return comparable to\nthat of American industry in general. We believe that Gillette,\nunder Colman's management, will far exceed that return and\nbelieve that John, Ed, and Andy will reach it unless industry\nconditions are harsh.\nUnder almost any conditions, we expect these preferreds to\nreturn us our money plus dividends. If that is all we get,\nthough, the result will be disappointing, because we will have\ngiven up flexibility and consequently will have missed some\nsignificant opportunities that are bound to present themselves\nduring the decade. Under that scenario, we will have obtained\nonly a preferred-stock yield during a period when the typical\npreferred stock will have held no appeal for us whatsoever. The\nonly way Berkshire can achieve satisfactory results from its four\npreferred issues is to have the common stocks of the investee\ncompanies do well.\nGood management and at least tolerable industry conditions\nwill be needed if that is to happen. But we believe Berkshire's\ninvestment will also help and that the other shareholders of each\ninvestee will profit over the years ahead from our preferred-\nstock purchase. The help will come from the fact that each\ncompany now has a major, stable, and interested shareholder whose\nChairman and Vice Chairman have, through Berkshire's investments,\nindirectly committed a very large amount of their own money to\nthese undertakings. In dealing with our investees, Charlie and I\nwill be supportive, analytical, and objective. We recognize that\nwe are working with experienced CEOs who are very much in command\nof their own businesses but who nevertheless, at certain moments,\nappreciate the chance to test\ntheir thinking on someone without\nties to their industry or to decisions of the past.\nAs a group, these convertible preferreds will not produce\nthe returns we can achieve when we find a business with wonderful\neconomic prospects that is unappreciated by the market. Nor will\nthe returns be as attractive as those produced when we make our\nfavorite form of capital deployment, the acquisition of 80% or\nmore of a fine business with a fine management. But both\nopportunities are rare, particularly in a size befitting our\npresent and anticipated resources.\nIn summation, Charlie and I feel that our preferred stock\ninvestments should produce returns moderately above those\nachieved by most fixed-income portfolios and that we can play a\nminor but enjoyable and constructive role in the investee\ncompanies.\nZero-Coupon Securities\nIn September, Berkshire issued $902.6 million principal\namount of Zero-Coupon Convertible Subordinated Debentures, which\nare now listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Salomon Brothers\nhandled the underwriting in superb fashion, providing us helpful\nadvice and a flawless execution.\nMost bonds, of course, require regular payments of interest,\nusually semi-annually. A zero-coupon bond, conversely, requires\nno current interest payments; instead, the investor receives his\nyield by purchasing the security at a significant discount from\nmaturity value. The effective interest rate is determined by the\noriginal issue price, the maturity value, and the amount of time\nbetween issuance and maturity.\nIn our case, the bonds were issued at 44.314% of maturity\nvalue and are due in 15 years. For investors purchasing the\nbonds, that is the mathematical equivalent of a 5.5% current\npayment compounded semi-annually. Because we received only\n44.31 cents on the dollar, our proceeds from this offering were\n$400 million (less about $9.5 million of offering expenses).\nThe bonds were issued in denominations of $10,000 and each\nbond is convertible into .4515 shares of Berkshire Hathaway.\nBecause a $10,000 bond cost $4,431, this means that the\nconversion price was $9,815 per Berkshire share, a 15% premium to\nthe market price then existing. Berkshire can call the bonds at\nany time after\nSeptember 28, 1992 at their accreted value (the\noriginal issue price plus 5.5% compounded semi-annually) and on\ntwo specified days, September 28 of 1994 and 1999, the\nbondholders can require Berkshire to buy the securities at their\naccreted value.\nFor tax purposes, Berkshire is entitled to deduct the 5.5%\ninterest accrual each year, even though we make no payments to\nthe bondholders. Thus the net effect to us, resulting from the\nreduced taxes, is positive cash flow. That is a very significant\nbenefit. Some unknowable variables prevent us from calculating\nour exact effective rate of interest, but under all circumstances\nit will be well below 5.5%. There is meanwhile a symmetry to the\ntax law: Any taxable holder of the bonds must pay tax each year\non the 5.5% interest, even though he receives no cash.\nNeither our bonds nor those of certain other companies that\nissued similar bonds last year (notably Loews and Motorola)\nresemble the great bulk of zero-coupon bonds that have been\nissued in recent years. Of these, Charlie and I have been, and\nwill continue to be, outspoken critics. As I will later explain,\nsuch bonds have often been used in the most deceptive of ways and\nwith deadly consequences to investors. But before we tackle that\nsubject, let's travel back to Eden, to a time when the apple had\nnot yet been bitten.\nIf you're my age you bought your first zero-coupon bonds\nduring World War II, by purchasing the famous Series E U. S.\nSavings Bond, the most widely-sold bond issue in history. (After\nthe war, these bonds were held by one out of two U. S.\nhouseholds.) Nobody, of course, called the Series E a zero-coupon\nbond, a term in fact that I doubt had been invented. But that's\nprecisely what the Series E was.\nThese bonds came in denominations as small as $18.75. That\namount purchased a $25 obligation of the United States government\ndue in 10 years, terms that gave the buyer a compounded annual\nreturn of 2.9%. At the time, this was an attractive offer: the\n2.9% rate was higher than that generally available on Government\nbonds and the holder faced no market-fluctuation risk, since he\ncould at any time cash in his bonds with only a minor reduction\nin interest.\nA second form of zero-coupon U. S. Treasury issue, also\nbenign and useful, surfaced in the last decade. One problem with\na normal bond is that even though it pays a given interest rate -\nsay 10% - the holder cannot be assured that a compounded 10%\nreturn will be realized. For that rate to materialize, each semi-\nannual coupon must be reinvested at 10% as it is received. If\ncurrent interest rates are, say, only 6% or 7% when these coupons\ncome due, the holder will be unable to compound his money over\nthe life of the bond at the advertised rate. For pension funds or\nother investors with long-term liabilities, \"reinvestment risk\"\nof this type can be a serious problem. Savings Bonds might have\nsolved it, except that they are issued only to individuals and\nare unavailable in large denominations. What big buyers needed\nwas huge quantities of \"Savings Bond Equivalents.\"\nEnter some ingenious and, in this case, highly useful\ninvestment bankers (led, I'm happy to say, by Salomon Brothers).\nThey created the instrument desired by \"stripping\" the semi-\nannual coupons from standard Government issues. Each coupon, once\ndetached, takes on the essential character of a Savings Bond\nsince it represents a single sum due sometime in the future. For\nexample, if you strip the 40 semi-annual coupons from a U. S.\nGovernment Bond due in the year 2010, you will have 40 zero-\ncoupon bonds, with maturities from six months to 20 years, each\nof which can then be bundled with other coupons of like maturity\nand marketed. If current interest rates are, say, 10% for all\nmaturities, the six-month issue will sell for 95.24% of maturity\nvalue and the 20-year issue will sell for 14.20%. The purchaser\nof any given maturity is thus guaranteed a compounded rate of 10%\nfor his entire holding period. Stripping of government bonds has\noccurred on a large scale in recent years, as long-term\ninvestors, ranging from pension funds to individual IRA accounts,\nrecognized these high-grade, zero-coupon issues to be well suited\nto their needs.\nBut as happens in Wall Street all too often, what the wise\ndo in the beginning, fools do in the end. In the last few years\nzero-coupon bonds (and their functional equivalent, pay-in-kind\nbonds, which distribute additional PIK bonds semi-annually as\ninterest instead of paying cash) have been issued in enormous\nquantities by ever-junkier credits. To these issuers, zero (or\nPIK) bonds offer one overwhelming advantage:\nIt is impossible to\ndefault on a promise to pay nothing. Indeed, if LDC governments\nhad issued no debt in the 1970's other than long-term zero-coupon\nobligations, they would now have a spotless record as debtors.\nThis principle at work - that you need not default for a\nlong time if you solemnly promise to pay nothing for a long time\n- has not been lost on promoters and investment bankers seeking\nto finance ever-shakier deals. But its acceptance by lenders took\na while: When the leveraged buy-out craze began some years back,\npurchasers could borrow only on a reasonably sound basis, in\nwhich conservatively-estimated free cash flow - that is,\noperating earnings plus depreciation and amortization less\nnormalized capital expenditures - was adequate to cover both\ninterest and modest reductions in debt.\nLater, as the adrenalin of deal-makers surged, businesses\nbegan to be purchased at prices so high that all free cash flow\nnecessarily had to be allocated to the payment of interest. That\nleft nothing for the paydown of debt. In effect, a Scarlett\nO'Hara \"I'll think about it tomorrow\" position in respect to\nprincipal payments was taken by borrowers and accepted by a new\nbreed of lender, the buyer of original-issue junk bonds. Debt now\nbecame something to be refinanced rather than repaid. The change\nbrings to mind a New Yorker cartoon in which the grateful\nborrower rises to shake the hand of the bank's lending officer\nand gushes: \"I don't know how I'll ever repay you.\"\nSoon borrowers found even the new, lax standards intolerably\nbinding. To induce lenders to finance even sillier transactions,\nthey introduced an abomination, EBDIT - Earnings Before\nDepreciation, Interest and Taxes - as the test of a company's\nability to pay interest. Using this sawed-off yardstick, the\nborrower ignored depreciation as an expense on the theory that it\ndid not require a current cash outlay.\nSuch an attitude is clearly delusional. At 95% of American\nbusinesses, capital expenditures that over time roughly\napproximate depreciation are a necessity and are every bit as\nreal an expense as labor or utility costs. Even a high school\ndropout knows that to finance a car he must have income that\ncovers not only interest and operating expenses, but also\nrealistically-calculated depreciation. He would be laughed out of\nthe bank if he started talking about EBDIT.\nCapital outlays at a business can be skipped, of course, in\nany given month, just as a human can skip a day or even a week of\neating. But if the skipping becomes routine and is not made up,\nthe body weakens and eventually dies. Furthermore, a start-and-\nstop feeding policy will over time produce a less healthy\norganism, human or corporate, than that produced by a steady\ndiet. As businessmen, Charlie and I relish having competitors who\nare unable to fund capital expenditures.\nYou might think that waving away a major expense such as\ndepreciation in an attempt to make a terrible deal look like a\ngood one hits the limits of Wall Street's ingenuity. If so, you\nhaven't been paying attention during the past few years.\nPromoters needed to find a way to justify even pricier\nacquisitions. Otherwise, they risked - heaven forbid! - losing\ndeals to other promoters with more \"imagination.\"\nSo, stepping through the Looking Glass, promoters and their\ninvestment bankers proclaimed that EBDIT should now be measured\nagainst cash interest only, which meant that interest accruing on\nzero-coupon or PIK bonds could be ignored when the financial\nfeasibility of a transaction was being assessed. This approach\nnot only relegated depreciation expense to the let's-ignore-it\ncorner, but gave similar treatment to what was usually a\nsignificant portion of interest expense. To their shame, many\nprofessional investment managers went along with this nonsense,\nthough they usually were careful to do so only with clients'\nmoney, not their own. (Calling these managers \"professionals\" is\nactually too kind; they should be designated \"promotees.\")\nUnder this new standard, a business earning, say, $100\nmillion pre-tax and having debt on which $90 million of interest\nmust be paid currently, might use a zero-coupon or PIK issue to\nincur another $60 million of annual interest that would accrue\nand compound but not come due for some years. The rate on these\nissues would typically be very high, which means that the\nsituation in year 2 might be $90 million cash interest plus $69\nmillion accrued interest, and so on as the compounding proceeds.\nSuch high-rate reborrowing schemes, which a few years ago were\nappropriately confined to the waterfront,\nsoon became models of\nmodern finance at virtually all major investment banking houses.\nWhen they make these offerings, investment bankers display\ntheir humorous side: They dispense income and balance sheet\nprojections extending five or more years into the future for\ncompanies they barely had heard of a few months earlier. If you\nare shown such schedules, I suggest that you join in the fun:\nAsk the investment banker for the one-year budgets that his own\nfirm prepared as the last few years began and then compare these\nwith what actually happened.\nSome time ago Ken Galbraith, in his witty and insightful\nThe Great Crash, coined a new economic term: \"the bezzle,\"\ndefined as the current amount of undiscovered embezzlement. This\nfinancial creature has a magical quality: The embezzlers are richer\nby the amount of the bezzle, while the embezzlees do not yet feel\npoorer.\nProfessor Galbraith astutely pointed out that this sum\nshould be added to the National Wealth so that we might know the\nPsychic National Wealth. Logically, a society that wanted to feel\nenormously prosperous would both encourage its citizens to\nembezzle and try not to detect the crime. By this means, \"wealth\"\nwould balloon though not an erg of productive work had been done.\nThe satirical nonsense of the bezzle is dwarfed by the real-\nworld nonsense of the zero-coupon bond. With zeros, one party to\na contract can experience \"income\" without his opposite\nexperiencing the pain of expenditure. In our illustration, a\ncompany capable of earning only $100 million dollars annually -\nand therefore capable of paying only that much in interest -\nmagically creates \"earnings\" for bondholders of $150 million. As\nlong as major investors willingly don their Peter Pan wings and\nrepeatedly say \"I believe,\" there is no limit to how much\n\"income\" can be created by the zero-coupon bond.\nWall Street welcomed this invention with the enthusiasm\nless-enlightened folk might reserve for the wheel or the plow.\nHere, finally, was an instrument that would let the Street make\ndeals at prices no longer limited by actual earning power. The\nresult, obviously, would be more transactions: Silly prices will\nalways attract sellers. And, as Jesse Unruh might have put it,\ntransactions are the mother's milk of finance.\nThe zero-coupon or PIK bond possesses one additional\nattraction for the promoter and investment banker, which is that\nthe time elapsing between folly and failure can be stretched out.\nThis is no small benefit. If the period before all costs must be\nfaced is long, promoters can create a string of foolish deals -\nand take in lots of fees - before any chickens come home to roost\nfrom their earlier ventures.\nBut in the end, alchemy, whether it is metallurgical or\nfinancial, fails. A base business can not be transformed into a\ngolden business by tricks of accounting or capital structure. The\nman claiming to be a financial alchemist may become rich. But\ngullible investors rather than business achievements will usually\nbe the source of his wealth.\nWhatever their weaknesses, we should add, many zero-coupon\nand PIK bonds will not default. We have in fact owned some and\nmay buy more if their market becomes sufficiently distressed.\n(We've not, however, even considered buying a new issue from a\nweak credit.) No financial instrument is evil per se; it's just\nthat some variations have far more potential for mischief than\nothers.\nThe blue ribbon for mischief-making should go to the zero-\ncoupon issuer unable to make its interest payments on a current\nbasis. Our advice: Whenever an investment banker starts talking\nabout EBDIT - or whenever someone creates a capital structure\nthat does not allow all interest, both payable and accrued, to be\ncomfortably met out of current cash flow net of ample capital\nexpenditures - zip up your wallet. Turn the tables by suggesting\nthat the promoter and his high-priced entourage accept zero-\ncoupon fees, deferring their take until the zero-coupon bonds\nhave been paid in full. See then how much enthusiasm for the deal\nendures.\nOur comments about investment bankers may seem harsh. But\nCharlie and I - in our hopelessly old-fashioned way - believe\nthat they should perform a gatekeeping role, guarding investors\nagainst the promoter's propensity to indulge in excess.\nPromoters, after all, have throughout time exercised the same\njudgment and restraint in accepting money that alcoholics have\nexercised in accepting liquor. At a minimum, therefore, the\nbanker's conduct should rise to that of a responsible bartender\nwho, when necessary, refuses the profit from the next drink to\navoid sending a drunk out on the highway. In recent years,\nunfortunately, many leading investment firms have found bartender\nmorality to be an intolerably restrictive standard. Lately, those\nwho have traveled the high road in Wall Street have not\nencountered heavy traffic.\nOne distressing footnote: The cost of the zero-coupon folly\nwill not be borne solely by the direct participants. Certain\nsavings and loan associations were heavy buyers of such bonds,\nusing cash that came from FSLIC-insured deposits. Straining to\nshow splendid earnings, these buyers recorded - but did not\nreceive - ultra-high interest income on these issues. Many of\nthese\nassociations are now in\nmajor trouble. Had their loans to\nshaky credits worked, the owners of the associations would have\npocketed the profits. In the many cases in which the loans will\nfail, the taxpayer will pick up the bill. To paraphrase Jackie\nMason, at these associations it was the managers who should have\nbeen wearing the ski masks.\nMistakes of the First Twenty-five Years (A Condensed Version)\nTo quote Robert Benchley, \"Having a dog teaches a boy\nfidelity, perseverance, and to turn around three times before\nlying down.\" Such are the shortcomings of experience.\nNevertheless, it's a good idea to review past mistakes before\ncommitting new ones. So let's take a quick look at the last 25\nyears.\no\nMy first mistake, of course, was in buying control of\nBerkshire. Though I knew its business - textile manufacturing -\nto be unpromising, I was enticed to buy because the price looked\ncheap. Stock purchases of that kind had proved reasonably\nrewarding in my early years, though by the time Berkshire came\nalong in 1965 I was becoming aware that the strategy was not\nideal.\nIf you buy a stock at a sufficiently low price, there will\nusually be some hiccup in the fortunes of the business that gives\nyou a chance to unload at a decent profit, even though the long-\nterm performance of the business may be terrible. I call this the\n\"cigar butt\" approach to investing. A cigar butt found on the\nstreet that has only one puff left in it may not offer much of a\nsmoke, but the \"bargain purchase\" will make that puff all profit.\nUnless you are a liquidator, that kind of approach to buying\nbusinesses is foolish. First, the original \"bargain\" price\nprobably will not turn out to be such a steal after all. In a\ndifficult business, no sooner is one problem solved than another\nsurfaces -\nnever is there just one cockroach in the kitchen.\nSecond, any initial advantage you secure will be quickly eroded\nby the low return that the business earns. For example, if you\nbuy a business for $8 million that can be sold or liquidated for\n$10 million and promptly take either course, you can realize a\nhigh return. But the investment will disappoint if the business\nis sold for $10 million in ten years and in the interim has\nannually earned and distributed only a few percent on cost. Time\nis the friend of the wonderful business, the enemy of the\nmediocre.\nYou might think this principle is obvious, but I had to\nlearn it the hard way - in fact, I had to learn it several times\nover. Shortly after purchasing Berkshire, I acquired a Baltimore\ndepartment store, Hochschild Kohn, buying through a company\ncalled Diversified Retailing that later merged with Berkshire. I\nbought at a substantial discount from book value, the people were\nfirst-class, and the deal included some extras - unrecorded real\nestate values and a significant LIFO inventory cushion. How could\nI miss? So-o-o - three years later I was lucky to sell the\nbusiness for about what I had paid. After ending our corporate\nmarriage to Hochschild Kohn, I had memories like those of the\nhusband in the country song, \"My Wife Ran Away With My Best\nFriend and I Still Miss Him a Lot.\"\nI could give you other personal examples of \"bargain-\npurchase\" folly but I'm sure you get the picture:\nIt's far\nbetter to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair\ncompany at a wonderful price. Charlie understood this early; I\nwas a slow learner. But now, when buying companies or common\nstocks, we look for first-class businesses accompanied by first-\nclass managements.\no\nThat leads right into a related lesson: Good jockeys will\ndo well on good horses, but not on broken-down nags. Both\nBerkshire's textile business and Hochschild, Kohn had able and\nhonest people running them. The same managers employed in a\nbusiness with good economic characteristics would have achieved\nfine records. But they were never going to make any progress\nwhile running in quicksand.\nI've said many times that when a management with a\nreputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation\nfor bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that\nremains intact. I just wish I hadn't been so energetic in\ncreating examples. My behavior has matched that admitted by\nMae\nWest: \"I was Snow White, but I drifted.\"\no\nA further related lesson: Easy does it. After 25 years of\nbuying and supervising a great variety of businesses, Charlie and\nI have not learned how to solve difficult business problems. What\nwe have learned is to avoid them. To the extent we have been\nsuccessful, it is because we concentrated on identifying one-foot\nhurdles that we could step over rather than because we acquired\nany ability to clear seven-footers.\nThe finding may seem unfair, but in both business and\ninvestments it is usually far more profitable to simply stick\nwith the easy and obvious than it is to resolve the difficult. On\noccasion, tough problems must be tackled as was the case when we\nstarted our Sunday paper in Buffalo. In other instances, a great\ninvestment opportunity occurs when a marvelous business\nencounters a one-time huge, but solvable, problem as was the case\nmany years back at both American Express and GEICO. Overall,\nhowever, we've done better by avoiding dragons than by slaying\nthem.\no\nMy most surprising discovery: the overwhelming importance in\nbusiness of an unseen force that we might call \"the institutional\nimperative.\" In business school, I was given no hint of the\nimperative's existence and I did not intuitively understand it\nwhen I entered the business world. I thought then that decent,\nintelligent, and experienced managers would automatically make\nrational business decisions. But I learned over time that isn't\nso. Instead, rationality frequently wilts when the institutional\nimperative comes into play.\nFor example: (1) As if governed by Newton's First Law of\nMotion, an institution will resist any change in its current\ndirection; (2) Just as work expands to fill available time,\ncorporate projects or acquisitions will materialize to soak up\navailable funds; (3) Any business craving of the leader, however\nfoolish, will be quickly supported by detailed rate-of-return and\nstrategic studies prepared by his troops; and (4) The behavior of\npeer companies, whether they are expanding, acquiring, setting\nexecutive compensation or whatever, will be mindlessly imitated.\nInstitutional dynamics, not venality or stupidity, set\nbusinesses on these courses, which are too often misguided. After\nmaking some expensive mistakes because I ignored the power of the\nimperative, I have tried to organize and manage Berkshire in ways\nthat minimize its influence. Furthermore, Charlie and I have\nattempted to concentrate our investments in companies that appear\nalert to the problem.\no\nAfter some other mistakes, I learned to go into business\nonly with people whom I like, trust, and admire. As I noted\nbefore, this policy of itself will not ensure success: A second-\nclass textile or department-store company won't prosper simply\nbecause its managers are men that you would be pleased to see\nyour daughter marry. However, an owner - or investor - can\naccomplish wonders if he manages to associate himself with such\npeople in businesses that possess decent economic\ncharacteristics. Conversely, we do not wish to join with managers\nwho lack admirable qualities, no matter how attractive the\nprospects of their business. We've never succeeded in making a\ngood deal with a bad person.\no\nSome of my worst mistakes were not publicly visible. These\nwere stock and business purchases whose virtues I understood and\nyet didn't make. It's no sin to miss a great opportunity outside\none's area of competence. But I have passed on a couple of really\nbig purchases that were served up to me on a platter and that I\nwas fully capable of understanding. For Berkshire's shareholders,\nmyself included, the cost of this thumb-sucking has been huge.\no\nOur consistently-conservative financial policies may appear\nto have been a mistake, but in my view were not. In retrospect,\nit is clear that significantly higher, though still conventional,\nleverage ratios at Berkshire would have produced considerably\nbetter returns on equity than the 23.8% we have actually\naveraged. Even in 1965, perhaps we could have judged there to be\na 99% probability that higher leverage would lead to nothing but\ngood. Correspondingly, we might have seen only a 1% chance that\nsome shock factor, external or internal, would cause a\nconventional debt ratio to produce a result falling somewhere\nbetween temporary anguish and default.\nWe wouldn't have liked those 99:1 odds - and never will. A\nsmall chance of distress or disgrace cannot, in our view, be\noffset by a large chance of extra returns. If your actions are\nsensible, you are certain to get good results; in most such\ncases, leverage just moves things along faster. Charlie and I\nhave never been in a big hurry: We enjoy the process far more\nthan the proceeds - though we have learned to live with those\nalso.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nWe hope in another 25 years to report on the mistakes of the\nfirst 50. If we are around in 2015 to do that, you can count on\nthis section occupying many more pages than it does here.\nMiscellaneous\nWe hope to buy more businesses that are similar to the ones\nwe have, and we can use some help. If you have a business that\nfits the following criteria, call me or, preferably, write.\nHere's what we're looking for:\n(1)\nLarge purchases (at least $10 million of after-tax\nearnings),\n(2)\ndemonstrated consistent earning power (future\nprojections are of little interest to us, nor are\n\"turnaround\" situations),\n(3)\nbusinesses earning good returns on equity while\nemploying little or no debt,\n(4)\nmanagement in place (we can't supply it),\n(5)\nsimple businesses (if there's lots of technology, we\nwon't understand it),\n(6)\nan offering price\n(we don't want to waste our time or\nthat of the seller by talking,\neven\npreliminarily,\nabout a transaction when price is unknown).\nWe will not engage in unfriendly takeovers. We can promise\ncomplete confidentiality and a very fast answer - customarily\nwithin five minutes - as to whether we're interested. We prefer\nto buy for cash, but will consider issuing stock when we receive\nas much in intrinsic business value as we give.\nOur favorite form of purchase is one fitting the Blumkin-\nFriedman-Heldman mold. In cases like these, the company's owner-\nmanagers wish to generate significant amounts of cash, sometimes\nfor themselves, but often for their families or inactive\nshareholders. At the same time, these managers wish to remain\nsignificant owners who continue to run their companies just as\nthey have in the past. We think we offer a particularly good fit\nfor owners with such objectives. We invite potential sellers to\ncheck us out by contacting people with whom we have done business\nin the past.\nCharlie and I frequently get approached about acquisitions\nthat don't come close to meeting our tests:\nWe've found that if\nyou advertise an interest in buying collies, a lot of people will\ncall hoping to sell you their cocker spaniels. Our interest in\nnew ventures, turnarounds, or auction-like sales can best be\nexpressed by a Goldwynism: \"Please include me out.\"\nBesides being interested in the purchase of businesses as\ndescribed above, we are also interested in the negotiated\npurchase of large, but not controlling, blocks of stock\ncomparable to those we hold in Capital Cities, Salomon, Gillette,\nUSAir and Champion. Last year we said we had a special interest\nin large purchases of convertible preferreds. We still have an\nappetite of that kind, but it is limited since we now are close\nto the maximum position we feel appropriate for this category of\ninvestment.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nTwo years ago, I told you about Harry Bottle, who in 1962\nquickly cured a major business mess at the first industrial\ncompany I controlled, Dempster Mill Manufacturing (one of my\n\"bargain\" purchases) and who 24 years later had reappeared to\nagain rescue me, this time from problems at K&W Products, a small\nBerkshire subsidiary that produces automotive compounds. As I\nreported, in short order Harry reduced capital employed at K&W,\nrationalized production, cut costs, and quadrupled profits. You\nmight think he would then have paused for breath. But last year\nHarry, now 70, attended a bankruptcy auction and, for a pittance,\nacquired a product line that is a natural for K&W. That company's\nprofitability may well be increased 50% by this coup. Watch this\nspace for future bulletins on Harry's triumphs.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nWith more than a year behind him of trading Berkshire's\nstock on the New York Stock Exchange, our specialist, Jim Maguire\nof Henderson Brothers, Inc. (\"HBI\"), continues his outstanding\nperformance. Before we listed, dealer spreads often were 3% or\nmore of market price. Jim has maintained the spread at 50 points\nor less, which at current prices is well under 1%. Shareholders\nwho buy or sell benefit significantly from this reduction in\ntransaction costs.\nBecause we are delighted by our experience with Jim, HBI and\nthe NYSE, I said as much in ads that have been run in a series\nplaced by the NYSE. Normally I shun testimonials, but I was\npleased in this instance to publicly compliment the Exchange.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nLast summer we sold the corporate jet that we purchased for\n$850,000 three years ago and bought another used jet for $6.7\nmillion. Those of you who recall the mathematics of the\nmultiplying bacteria on page 5 will understandably panic: If our\nnet worth continues to increase at current rates, and the cost of\nreplacing planes also continues to rise at the now-established\nrate of 100% compounded annually, it will not be long before\nBerkshire's entire net worth is consumed by its jet.\nCharlie doesn't like it when I equate the jet with bacteria;\nhe feels it's degrading to the bacteria. His idea of traveling in\nstyle is an air-conditioned bus, a luxury he steps up to only\nwhen bargain fares are in effect. My own attitude toward the jet\ncan be summarized by the prayer attributed, apocryphally I'm\nsure, to St. Augustine as he contemplated leaving a life of\nsecular pleasures to become a priest. Battling the conflict\nbetween intellect and glands, he pled: \"Help me, Oh Lord, to\nbecome chaste - but not yet.\"\nNaming the plane has not been easy. I initially suggested\n\"The Charles T. Munger.\" Charlie countered with \"The Aberration.\"\nWe finally settled on \"The Indefensible.\"\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nAbout 96.9% of all eligible shares participated in\nBerkshire's 1989 shareholder-designated contributions program.\nContributions made through the program were $5.9 million, and\n2,550 charities were recipients.\nWe urge new shareholders to read the description of our\nshareholder-designated contributions program that appears on\npages 52-53. If you wish to participate in future programs, we\nstrongly urge that you immediately make sure your shares are\nregistered in the name of the actual owner, not in the nominee\nname of a broker, bank or depository. Shares not so registered on\nAugust 31, 1990 will be ineligible for the 1990 program.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nThe annual meeting this year will take place at 9:30 a.m. on\nMonday, April 30, 1990. Attendance grew last year to about 1,000,\nvery close to the seating capacity of the Witherspoon Hall at\nJoslyn Museum. So this year's meeting will be moved to the\nOrpheum Theatre, which is in downtown Omaha, about one-quarter of\na mile from the Red Lion Hotel. The Radisson-Redick Tower, a much\nsmaller but nice hotel, is located across the street from the\nOrpheum. Or you may wish to stay at the Marriott, which is in\nwest Omaha, about 100 yards from Borsheim's. We will have buses\nat the Marriott that will leave at 8:30 and 8:45 for the meeting\nand return after it ends.\nCharlie and I always enjoy the meeting, and we hope you can\nmake it. The quality of our shareholders is reflected in the\nquality of the questions we get: We have never attended an annual\nmeeting anywhere that features such a consistently high level of\nintelligent, owner-related questions.\nAn attachment to our proxy material explains how you can\nobtain the card you will need for admission to the meeting.\nBecause weekday parking can be tight around the Orpheum, we have\nlined up a number of nearby lots for our shareholders to use. The\nattachment also contains information about them.\nAs usual, we will have buses to take you to Nebraska\nFurniture Mart and Borsheim's after the meeting and to take you\nto downtown hotels or to the airport later. I hope that you will\nallow plenty of time to fully explore the attractions of both\nstores. Those of you arriving early can visit the Furniture Mart\nany day of the week; it is open from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on\nSaturdays, and from noon to 5:30 p.m. on Sundays.\nBorsheim's normally is closed on Sunday, but we will open\nfor shareholders and their guests from noon to 6 p.m. on Sunday,\nApril 29th. Ike likes to put on a show, and you can rely on him\nto produce something very special for our shareholders.\nIn this letter we've had a lot to say about rates of\ncompounding. If you can bear having your own rate turn negative\nfor a day - not a pretty thought, I admit - visit Ike on the\n29th.\nWarren E. Buffett\nMarch 2, 1990\nChairman of the Board",

    "text": "Chairman's Letter - 1990\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nLast year we made a prediction: \"A reduction [in Berkshire's net worth] is almost certain in at least one of the next three years.\" During much of 1990's second half, we were on the road to quickly proving that forecast accurate. But some strengthening in stock prices late in the year enabled us to close 1990 with net worth up by $362 million, or 7.3%. Over the last 26 years (that is, since present management took over) our per-share book value has grown from $19.46 to $4,612.06, or at a rate of 23.2% compounded annually.\nOur growth rate was lackluster in 1990 because our four major common stock holdings, in aggregate, showed little change in market value. Last year I told you that though these companies - Capital Cities/ABC, Coca-Cola, GEICO, and Washington Post - had fine businesses and superb managements, widespread recognition of these attributes had pushed the stock prices of the four to lofty levels. The market prices of the two media companies have since fallen significantly - for good reasons relating to evolutionary industry developments that I will discuss later - and the price of Coca-Cola stock has increased significantly for what I also believe are good reasons. Overall, yearend 1990 prices of our \"permanent four,\" though far from enticing, were a bit more appealing than they were a year earlier.\nBerkshire's 26-year record is meaningless in forecasting future results; so also, we hope, is the one-year record. We continue to aim for a 15% average annual gain in intrinsic value. But, as we never tire of telling you, this goal becomes ever more difficult to reach as our equity base, now $5.3 billion, increases.\nIf we do attain that 15% average, our shareholders should fare well. However, Berkshire's corporate gains will produce an identical gain for a specific shareholder only if he eventually sells his shares at the same relationship to intrinsic value that existed when he bought them. For example, if you buy at a 10% premium to intrinsic value; if intrinsic value subsequently grows at 15% a year; and if you then sell at a 10% premium, your own return will correspondingly be 15% compounded. (The calculation assumes that no dividends are paid.) If, however, you buy at a premium and sell at a smaller premium, your results will be somewhat inferior to those achieved by the company.\nIdeally, the results of every Berkshire shareholder would closely mirror those of the company during his period of ownership. That is why Charlie Munger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman and my partner, and I hope for Berkshire to sell consistently at about intrinsic value. We prefer such steadiness to the value-ignoring volatility of the past two years: In 1989 intrinsic value grew less than did book value, which was up 44%, while the market price rose 85%; in 1990 book value and intrinsic value increased by a small amount, while the market price fell 23%.\nBerkshire's intrinsic value continues to exceed book value by a substantial margin. We can't tell you the exact differential because intrinsic value is necessarily an estimate; Charlie and I might, in fact, differ by 10% in our appraisals. We do know, however, that we own some exceptional businesses that are worth considerably more than the values at which they are carried on our books.\nMuch of the extra value that exists in our businesses has been created by the managers now running them. Charlie and I feel free to brag about this group because we had nothing to do with developing the skills they possess: These superstars just came that way. Our job is merely to identify talented managers and provide an environment in which they can do their stuff. Having done it, they send their cash to headquarters and we face our only other task: the intelligent deployment of these funds.\nMy own role in operations may best be illustrated by a small tale concerning my granddaughter, Emily, and her fourth birthday party last fall. Attending were other children, adoring relatives, and Beemer the Clown, a local entertainer who includes magic tricks in his act.\nBeginning these, Beemer asked Emily to help him by waving a \"magic wand\" over \"the box of wonders.\" Green handkerchiefs went into the box, Emily waved the wand, and Beemer removed blue ones. Loose handkerchiefs went in and, upon a magisterial wave by Emily, emerged knotted. After four such transformations, each more amazing than its predecessor, Emily was unable to contain herself. Her face aglow, she exulted: \"Gee, I'm really good at this.\"\nAnd that sums up my contribution to the performance of Berkshire's business magicians - the Blumkins, the Friedman family, Mike Goldberg, the Heldmans, Chuck Huggins, Stan Lipsey and Ralph Schey. They deserve your applause.\nSources of Reported Earnings\nThe table below shows the major sources of Berkshire's reported earnings. In this presentation, amortization of Goodwill and other major purchase-price accounting adjustments are not charged against the specific businesses to which they apply, but are instead aggregated and shown separately. This procedure lets you view the earnings of our businesses as they would have been reported had we not purchased them. I've explained in past reports why this form of presentation seems to us to be more useful to investors and managers than one utilizing generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which require purchase-price adjustments to be made on a business-by-business basis. The total net earnings we show in the table are, of course, identical to the GAAP total in our audited financial statements.\nMuch additional information about these businesses is given on pages 39-46, where you also will find our segment earnings reported on a GAAP basis. For information on Wesco's businesses, I urge you to read Charlie Munger's letter, which starts on page 56. His letter also contains the clearest and most insightful discussion of the banking industry that I have seen.\n(000s omitted)\n-----------------------------------------\nBerkshire's Share\nof Net Earnings\n(after taxes and\nPre-Tax Earnings\nminority interests)\n-------------------\n-------------------\n1990\n1989\n1990\n1989\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nOperating Earnings:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting ................ $(26,647)\n$(24,400)\n$(14,936)\n$(12,259)\nNet Investment Income .......\n327,048\n243,599\n282,613\n213,642\nBuffalo News ..................\n43,954\n46,047\n25,981\n27,771\nFechheimer ....................\n12,450\n12,621\n6,605\n6,789\nKirby .........................\n27,445\n26,114\n17,613\n16,803\nNebraska Furniture Mart .......\n17,248\n17,070\n8,485\n8,441\nScott Fetzer Manufacturing Group\n30,378\n33,165\n18,458\n19,996\nSee's Candies .................\n39,580\n34,235\n23,892\n20,626\nWesco - other than Insurance ..\n12,441\n13,008\n9,676\n9,810\nWorld Book ....................\n31,896\n25,583\n20,420\n16,372\nAmortization of Goodwill ......\n(3,476)\n(3,387)\n(3,461)\n(3,372)\nOther Purchase-Price\nAccounting Charges .........\n(5,951)\n(5,740)\n(6,856)\n(6,668)\nInterest Expense* .............\n(76,374)\n(42,389)\n(49,726)\n(27,098)\nShareholder-Designated\nContributions ..............\n(5,824)\n(5,867)\n(3,801)\n(3,814)\nOther .........................\n58,309\n23,755\n35,782\n12,863\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nOperating Earnings ..............\n482,477\n393,414\n370,745\n299,902\nSales of Securities .............\n33,989\n223,810\n23,348\n147,575\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nTotal Earnings - All Entities\n$516,466\n$617,224\n$394,093\n$447,477\n========\n========\n========\n========\n*Excludes interest expense of Scott Fetzer Financial Group and Mutual Savings & Loan.\nWe refer you also to pages 47-53, where we have rearranged Berkshire's financial data into four segments. These correspond to the way Charlie and I think about the business and should help you more in estimating Berkshire's intrinsic value than consolidated figures would do. Shown on these pages are balance sheets and earnings statements for: (1) our insurance operations, with their major investment positions itemized; (2) our manufacturing, publishing and retailing businesses, leaving aside certain non- operating assets and purchase-price accounting adjustments; (3) our subsidiaries engaged in finance-type operations, which are Mutual Savings and Scott Fetzer Financial; and (4) an all-other category that includes the non-operating assets (primarily marketable securities) held by the companies in segment (2), all purchase- price accounting adjustments, and various assets and debts of the Wesco and Berkshire parent companies.\nIf you combine the earnings and net worths of these four segments, you will derive totals matching those shown on our GAAP statements. However, I want to emphasize that this four-category presentation does not fall within the purview of our auditors, who in no way bless it.\n\"Look-Through\" Earnings\nThe term \"earnings\" has a precise ring to it. And when an earnings figure is accompanied by an unqualified auditor's certificate, a naive reader might think it comparable in certitude to pi, calculated to dozens of decimal places.\nIn reality, however, earnings can be as pliable as putty when a charlatan heads the company reporting them. Eventually truth will surface, but in the meantime a lot of money can change hands. Indeed, some important American fortunes have been created by the monetization of accounting mirages.\nFunny business in accounting is not new. For connoisseurs of chicanery, I have attached as Appendix A on page 22 a previously unpublished satire on accounting practices written by Ben Graham in 1936. Alas, excesses similar to those he then lampooned have many times since found their way into the financial statements of major American corporations and been duly certified by big-name auditors. Clearly, investors must always keep their guard up and use accounting numbers as a beginning, not an end, in their attempts to calculate true \"economic earnings\" accruing to them.\nBerkshire's own reported earnings are misleading in a different, but important, way: We have huge investments in companies (\"investees\") whose earnings far exceed their dividends and in which we record our share of earnings only to the extent of the dividends we receive. The extreme case is Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. Our 17% share of the company's earnings amounted to more than $83 million last year. Yet only about $530,000 ($600,000 of dividends it paid us less some $70,000 of tax) is counted in Berkshire's GAAP earnings. The residual $82 million-plus stayed with Cap Cities as retained earnings, which work for our benefit but go unrecorded on our books.\nOur perspective on such \"forgotten-but-not-gone\" earnings is simple: The way they are accounted for is of no importance, but their ownership and subsequent utilization is all-important. We care not whether the auditors hear a tree fall in the forest; we do care who owns the tree and what's next done with it.\nWhen Coca-Cola uses retained earnings to repurchase its shares, the company increases our percentage ownership in what I regard to be the most valuable franchise in the world. (Coke also, of course, uses retained earnings in many other value-enhancing ways.) Instead of repurchasing stock, Coca-Cola could pay those funds to us in dividends, which we could then use to purchase more Coke shares. That would be a less efficient scenario: Because of taxes we would pay on dividend income, we would not be able to increase our proportionate ownership to the degree that Coke can, acting for us. If this less efficient procedure were followed, however, Berkshire would report far greater \"earnings.\"\nI believe the best way to think about our earnings is in terms of \"look-through\" results, calculated as follows: Take $250 million, which is roughly our share of the 1990 operating earnings retained by our investees; subtract $30 million, for the incremental taxes we would have owed had that $250 million been paid to us in dividends; and add the remainder, $220 million, to our reported operating earnings of $371 million. Thus our 1990 \"look-through earnings\" were about $590 million.\nAs I mentioned last year, we hope to have look-through earnings grow about 15% annually. In 1990 we substantially exceeded that rate but in 1991 we will fall far short of it. Our Gillette preferred has been called and we will convert it into common stock on April 1. This will reduce reported earnings by about $35 million annually and look-through earnings by a much smaller, but still significant, amount. Additionally, our media earnings - both direct and look-through - appear sure to decline. Whatever the results, we will post you annually on how we are doing on a look-through basis.\nNon-Insurance Operations\nTake another look at the figures on page 51, which aggregate the earnings and balance sheets of our non-insurance operations. After-tax earnings on average equity in 1990 were 51%, a result that would have placed the group about 20th on the 1989 Fortune 500.\nTwo factors make this return even more remarkable. First, leverage did not produce it: Almost all our major facilities are owned, not leased, and such small debt as these operations have is basically offset by cash they hold. In fact, if the measurement was return on assets - a calculation that eliminates the effect of debt upon returns - our group would rank in Fortune's top ten.\nEqually important, our return was not earned from industries, such as cigarettes or network television stations, possessing spectacular economics for all participating in them. Instead it came from a group of businesses operating in such prosaic fields as furniture retailing, candy, vacuum cleaners, and even steel warehousing. The explanation is clear: Our extraordinary returns flow from outstanding operating managers, not fortuitous industry economics.\nLet's look at the larger operations:\no      It was a poor year for retailing - particularly for big-ticket items - but someone forgot to tell Ike Friedman at Borsheim's. Sales were up 18%. That's both a same-stores and all-stores percentage, since Borsheim's operates but one establishment.\nBut, oh, what an establishment! We can't be sure about the fact (because most fine-jewelry retailers are privately owned) but we believe that this jewelry store does more volume than any other in the U.S., except for Tiffany's New York store.\nBorsheim's could not do nearly that well if our customers came only from the Omaha metropolitan area, whose population is about 600,000. We have long had a huge percentage of greater Omaha's jewelry business, so growth in that market is necessarily limited. But every year business from non-Midwest customers grows dramatically. Many visit the store in person. A large number of others, however, buy through the mail in a manner you will find interesting.\nThese customers request a jewelry selection of a certain type and value - say, emeralds in the $10,000 -$20,000 range - and we then send them five to ten items meeting their specifications and from which they can pick. Last year we mailed about 1,500 assortments of all kinds, carrying values ranging from under $1,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nThe selections are sent all over the country, some to people no one at Borsheim's has ever met. (They must always have been well recommended, however.) While the number of mailings in 1990 was a record, Ike has been sending merchandise far and wide for decades. Misanthropes will be crushed to learn how well our \"honor-system\" works: We have yet to experience a loss from customer dishonesty.\nWe attract business nationwide because we have several advantages that competitors can't match. The most important item in the equation is our operating costs, which run about 18% of sales compared to 40% or so at the typical competitor. (Included in the 18% are occupancy and buying costs, which some public companies include in \"cost of goods sold.\") Just as Wal-Mart, with its 15% operating costs, sells at prices that high-cost competitors can't touch and thereby constantly increases its market share, so does Borsheim's. What works with diapers works with diamonds.\nOur low prices create huge volume that in turn allows us to carry an extraordinarily broad inventory of goods, running ten or more times the size of that at the typical fine-jewelry store. Couple our breadth of selection and low prices with superb service and you can understand how Ike and his family have built a national jewelry phenomenon from an Omaha location.\nAnd family it is. Ike's crew always includes son Alan and sons-in-law Marvin Cohn and Donald Yale. And when things are busy - that's often - they are joined by Ike's wife, Roz, and his daughters, Janis and Susie. In addition, Fran Blumkin, wife of Louie (Chairman of Nebraska Furniture Mart and Ike's cousin), regularly pitches in. Finally, you'll find Ike's 89-year-old mother, Rebecca, in the store most afternoons, Wall Street Journal in hand. Given a family commitment like this, is it any surprise that Borsheim's runs rings around competitors whose managers are thinking about how soon 5 o'clock will arrive?\no      While Fran Blumkin was helping the Friedman family set records at Borsheim's, her sons, Irv and Ron, along with husband Louie, were setting records at The Nebraska Furniture Mart. Sales at our one-and-only location were $159 million, up 4% from 1989. Though again the fact can't be conclusively proved, we believe NFM does close to double the volume of any other home furnishings store in the country.\nThe NFM formula for success parallels that of Borsheim's. First, operating costs are rock-bottom - 15% in 1990 against about 40% for Levitz, the country's largest furniture retailer, and 25% for Circuit City Stores, the leading discount retailer of electronics and appliances. Second, NFM's low costs allow the business to price well below all competitors. Indeed, major chains, knowing what they will face, steer clear of Omaha. Third, the huge volume generated by our bargain prices allows us to carry the broadest selection of merchandise available anywhere.\nSome idea of NFM's merchandising power can be gleaned from a recent report of consumer behavior in Des Moines, which showed that NFM was Number 3 in popularity among 20 furniture retailers serving that city. That may sound like no big deal until you consider that 19 of those retailers are located in Des Moines, whereas our store is 130 miles away. This leaves customers driving a distance equal to that between Washington and Philadelphia in order to shop with us, even though they have a multitude of alternatives next door. In effect, NFM, like Borsheim's, has dramatically expanded the territory it serves - not by the traditional method of opening new stores but rather by creating an irresistible magnet that employs price and selection to pull in the crowds.\nLast year at the Mart there occurred an historic event: I experienced a counterrevelation. Regular readers of this report know that I have long scorned the boasts of corporate executives about synergy, deriding such claims as the last refuge of scoundrels defending foolish acquisitions. But now I know better: In Berkshire's first synergistic explosion, NFM put a See's candy cart in the store late last year and sold more candy than that moved by some of the full-fledged stores See's operates in California. This success contradicts all tenets of retailing. With the Blumkins, though, the impossible is routine.\no      At See's, physical volume set a record in 1990 - but only barely and only because of good sales early in the year. After the invasion of Kuwait, mall traffic in the West fell. Our poundage volume at Christmas dropped slightly, though our dollar sales were up because of a 5% price increase.\nThat increase, and better control of expenses, improved profit margins. Against the backdrop of a weak retailing environment, Chuck Huggins delivered outstanding results, as he has in each of the nineteen years we have owned See's. Chuck's imprint on the business - a virtual fanaticism about quality and service - is visible at all of our 225 stores.\nOne happening in 1990 illustrates the close bond between See's and its customers. After 15 years of operation, our store in Albuquerque was endangered: The landlord would not renew our lease, wanting us instead to move to an inferior location in the mall and even so to pay a much higher rent. These changes would have wiped out the store's profit. After extended negotiations got us nowhere, we set a date for closing the store.\nOn her own, the store's manager, Ann Filkins, then took action, urging customers to protest the closing. Some 263 responded by sending letters and making phone calls to See's headquarters in San Francisco, in some cases threatening to boycott the mall. An alert reporter at the Albuquerque paper picked up the story. Supplied with this evidence of a consumer uprising, our landlord offered us a satisfactory deal. (He, too, proved susceptible to a counterrevelation.)\nChuck subsequently wrote personal letters of thanks to every loyalist and sent each a gift certificate. He repeated his thanks in a newspaper ad that listed the names of all 263. The sequel: Christmas sales in Albuquerque were up substantially.\no      Charlie and I were surprised at developments this past year in the media industry, including newspapers such as our Buffalo News. The business showed far more vulnerability to the early stages of a recession than has been the case in the past. The question is whether this erosion is just part of an aberrational cycle - to be fully made up in the next upturn - or whether the business has slipped in a way that permanently reduces intrinsic business values.\nSince I didn't predict what has happened, you may question the value of my prediction about what will happen. Nevertheless, I'll proffer a judgment: While many media businesses will remain economic marvels in comparison with American industry generally, they will prove considerably less marvelous than I, the industry, or lenders thought would be the case only a few years ago.\nThe reason media businesses have been so outstanding in the past was not physical growth, but rather the unusual pricing power that most participants wielded. Now, however, advertising dollars are growing slowly. In addition, retailers that do little or no media advertising (though they sometimes use the Postal Service) have gradually taken market share in certain merchandise categories. Most important of all, the number of both print and electronic advertising channels has substantially increased. As a consequence, advertising dollars are more widely dispersed and the pricing power of ad vendors has diminished. These circumstances materially reduce the intrinsic value of our major media investments and also the value of our operating unit, Buffalo News - though all remain fine businesses.\nNotwithstanding the problems, Stan Lipsey's management of the News continues to be superb. During 1990, our earnings held up much better than those of most metropolitan papers, falling only 5%. In the last few months of the year, however, the rate of decrease was far greater.\nI can safely make two promises about the News in 1991: (1) Stan will again rank at the top among newspaper publishers; and (2) earnings will fall substantially. Despite a slowdown in the demand for newsprint, the price per ton will average significantly more in 1991 and the paper's labor costs will also be considerably higher. Since revenues may meanwhile be down, we face a real squeeze.\nProfits may be off but our pride in the product remains. We continue to have a larger \"news hole\" - the portion of the paper devoted to news - than any comparable paper. In 1990, the proportion rose to 52.3% against 50.1% in 1989. Alas, the increase resulted from a decline in advertising pages rather than from a gain in news pages. Regardless of earnings pressures, we will maintain at least a 50% news hole. Cutting product quality is not a proper response to adversity.\no      The news at Fechheimer, our manufacturer and retailer of uniforms, is all good with one exception: George Heldman, at 69, has decided to retire. I tried to talk him out of it but he had one irrefutable argument: With four other Heldmans - Bob, Fred, Gary and Roger - to carry on, he was leaving us with an abundance of managerial talent.\nFechheimer's operating performance improved considerably in 1990, as many of the problems we encountered in integrating the large acquisition we made in 1988 were moderated or solved. However, several unusual items caused the earnings reported in the \"Sources\" table to be flat. In the retail operation, we continue to add stores and now have 42 in 22 states. Overall, prospects appear excellent for Fechheimer.\no      At Scott Fetzer, Ralph Schey runs 19 businesses with a mastery few bring to running one. In addition to overseeing three entities listed on page 6 - World Book, Kirby, and Scott Fetzer Manufacturing - Ralph directs a finance operation that earned a record $12.2 million pre-tax in 1990.\nWere Scott Fetzer an independent company, it would rank close to the top of the Fortune 500 in terms of return on equity, although it is not in businesses that one would expect to be economic champs. The superior results are directly attributable to Ralph.\nAt World Book, earnings improved on a small decrease in unit volume. The costs of our decentralization move were considerably less in 1990 than 1989 and the benefits of decentralization are being realized. World Book remains far and away the leader in United States encyclopedia sales and we are growing internationally, though from a small base.\nKirby unit volume grew substantially in 1990 with the help of our new vacuum cleaner, The Generation 3, which was an unqualified success. Earnings did not grow as fast as sales because of both start-up expenditures and \"learning-curve\" problems we encountered in manufacturing the new product. International business, whose dramatic growth I described last year, had a further 20% sales gain in 1990. With the aid of a recent price increase, we expect excellent earnings at Kirby in 1991.\nWithin the Scott Fetzer Manufacturing Group, Campbell Hausfeld, its largest unit, had a particularly fine year. This company, the country's leading producer of small and medium-sized air compressors, achieved record sales of $109 million, more than 30% of which came from products introduced during the last five years.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIn looking at the figures for our non-insurance operations, you will see that net worth increased by only $47 million in 1990 although earnings were $133 million. This does not mean that our managers are in any way skimping on investments that strengthen their business franchises or that promote growth. Indeed, they diligently pursue both goals.\nBut they also never deploy capital without good reason. The result: In the past five years they have funneled well over 80% of their earnings to Charlie and me for use in new business and investment opportunities.\nInsurance Operations\nShown below is an updated version of our usual table presenting key figures for the property-casualty insurance industry:\nYearly Change\nCombined Ratio\nYearly Change\nInflation Rate\nin Premiums\nAfter Policyholder\nin Incurred\nMeasured by\nWritten (%)\nDividends\nLosses (%)\nGNP Deflator (%)\n-------------\n------------------\n-------------\n----------------\n1981 .....\n3.8\n106.0\n6.5\n9.6\n1982 .....\n3.7\n109.6\n8.4\n6.5\n1983 .....\n5.0\n112.0\n6.8\n3.8\n1984 .....\n8.5\n118.0\n16.9\n3.8\n1985 .....\n22.1\n116.3\n16.1\n3.0\n1986 .....\n22.2\n108.0\n13.5\n2.6\n1987 .....\n9.4\n104.6\n7.8\n3.1\n1988 .....\n4.4\n105.4\n5.5\n3.3\n1989 (Revised)\n3.2\n109.2\n7.7\n4.1\n1990(Est.)\n4.5\n109.8\n5.0\n4.1\nSource: A.M. Best Co.\nThe combined ratio represents total insurance costs (losses incurred plus expenses) compared to revenue from premiums: A ratio below 100 indicates an underwriting profit, and one above 100 indicates a loss. The higher the ratio, the worse the year. When the investment income that an insurer earns from holding policyholders' funds (\"the float\") is taken into account, a combined ratio in the 107 - 111 range typically produces an overall breakeven result, exclusive of earnings on the funds provided by shareholders.\nFor the reasons laid out in previous reports, we expect the industry's incurred losses to grow at an average of 10% annually, even in periods when general inflation runs considerably lower. (Over the last 25 years, incurred losses have in reality grown at a still faster rate, 11%.) If premium growth meanwhile materially lags that 10% rate, underwriting losses will mount, though the industry's tendency to under-reserve when business turns bad may obscure their size for a time.\nLast year premium growth fell far short of the required 10% and underwriting results therefore worsened. (In our table, however, the severity of the deterioration in 1990 is masked because the industry's 1989 losses from Hurricane Hugo caused the ratio for that year to be somewhat above trendline.) The combined ratio will again increase in 1991, probably by about two points.\nResults will improve only when most insurance managements become so fearful that they run from business, even though it can be done at much higher prices than now exist. At some point these managements will indeed get the message: The most important thing to do when you find yourself in a hole is to stop digging. But so far that point hasn't gotten across: Insurance managers continue to dig - sullenly but vigorously.\nThe picture would change quickly if a major physical or financial catastrophe were to occur. Absent such a shock, one to two years will likely pass before underwriting losses become large enough to raise management fear to a level that would spur major price increases. When that moment arrives, Berkshire will be ready - both financially and psychologically - to write huge amounts of business.\nIn the meantime, our insurance volume continues to be small but satisfactory. In the next section of this report we will give you a framework for evaluating insurance results. From that discussion, you will gain an understanding of why I am so enthusiastic about the performance of our insurance manager, Mike Goldberg, and his cadre of stars, Rod Eldred, Dinos Iordanou, Ajit Jain, and Don Wurster.\nIn assessing our insurance results over the next few years, you should be aware of one type of business we are pursuing that could cause them to be unusually volatile. If this line of business expands, as it may, our underwriting experience will deviate from the trendline you might expect: In most years we will somewhat exceed expectations and in an occasional year we will fall far below them.\nThe volatility I predict reflects the fact that we have become a large seller of insurance against truly major catastrophes (\"super-cats\"), which could for example be hurricanes, windstorms or earthquakes. The buyers of these policies are reinsurance companies that themselves are in the business of writing catastrophe coverage for primary insurers and that wish to \"lay off,\" or rid themselves, of part of their exposure to catastrophes of special severity. Because the need for these buyers to collect on such a policy will only arise at times of extreme stress - perhaps even chaos - in the insurance business, they seek financially strong sellers. And here we have a major competitive advantage: In the industry, our strength is unmatched.\nA typical super-cat contract is complicated. But in a plain- vanilla instance we might write a one-year, $10 million policy providing that the buyer, a reinsurer, would be paid that sum only if a catastrophe caused two results: (1) specific losses for the reinsurer above a threshold amount; and (2) aggregate losses for the insurance industry of, say, more than $5 billion. Under virtually all circumstances, loss levels that satisfy the second condition will also have caused the first to be met.\nFor this $10 million policy, we might receive a premium of, say, $3 million. Say, also, that we take in annual premiums of $100 million from super-cat policies of all kinds. In that case we are very likely in any given year to report either a profit of close to $100 million or a loss of well over $200 million. Note that we are not spreading risk as insurers typically do; we are concentrating it. Therefore, our yearly combined ratio on this business will almost never fall in the industry range of 100 - 120, but will instead be close to either zero or 300%.\nMost insurers are financially unable to tolerate such swings. And if they have the ability to do so, they often lack the desire. They may back away, for example, because they write gobs of primary property insurance that would deliver them dismal results at the very time they would be experiencing major losses on super- cat reinsurance. In addition, most corporate managements believe that their shareholders dislike volatility in results.\nWe can take a different tack: Our business in primary property insurance is small and we believe that Berkshire shareholders, if properly informed, can handle unusual volatility in profits so long as the swings carry with them the prospect of superior long-term results. (Charlie and I always have preferred a lumpy 15% return to a smooth 12%.)\nWe want to emphasize three points: (1) While we expect our super-cat business to produce satisfactory results over, say, a decade, we're sure it will produce absolutely terrible results in at least an occasional year; (2) Our expectations can be based on little more than subjective judgments - for this kind of insurance, historical loss data are of very limited value to us as we decide what rates to charge today; and (3) Though we expect to write significant quantities of super-cat business, we will do so only at prices we believe to be commensurate with risk. If competitors become optimistic, our volume will fall. This insurance has, in fact, tended in recent years to be woefully underpriced; most sellers have left the field on stretchers.\nAt the moment, we believe Berkshire to be the largest U.S. writer of super-cat business. So when a major quake occurs in an urban area or a winter storm rages across Europe, light a candle for us.\nMeasuring Insurance Performance\nIn the previous section I mentioned \"float,\" the funds of others that insurers, in the conduct of their business, temporarily hold. Because these funds are available to be invested, the typical property-casualty insurer can absorb losses and expenses that exceed premiums by 7% to 11% and still be able to break even on its business. Again, this calculation excludes the earnings the insurer realizes on net worth - that is, on the funds provided by shareholders.\nHowever, many exceptions to this 7% to 11% range exist. For example, insurance covering losses to crops from hail damage produces virtually no float at all. Premiums on this kind of business are paid to the insurer just prior to the time hailstorms are a threat, and if a farmer sustains a loss he will be paid almost immediately. Thus, a combined ratio of 100 for crop hail insurance produces no profit for the insurer.\nAt the other extreme, malpractice insurance covering the potential liabilities of doctors, lawyers and accountants produces a very high amount of float compared to annual premium volume. The float materializes because claims are often brought long after the alleged wrongdoing takes place and because their payment may be still further delayed by lengthy litigation. The industry calls malpractice and certain other kinds of liability insurance \"long- tail\" business, in recognition of the extended period during which insurers get to hold large sums that in the end will go to claimants and their lawyers (and to the insurer's lawyers as well).\nIn long-tail situations a combined ratio of 115 (or even more) can prove profitable, since earnings produced by the float will exceed the 15% by which claims and expenses overrun premiums. The catch, though, is that \"long-tail\" means exactly that: Liability business written in a given year and presumed at first to have produced a combined ratio of 115 may eventually smack the insurer with 200, 300 or worse when the years have rolled by and all claims have finally been settled.\nThe pitfalls of this business mandate an operating principle that too often is ignored: Though certain long-tail lines may prove profitable at combined ratios of 110 or 115, insurers will invariably find it unprofitable to price using those ratios as targets. Instead, prices must provide a healthy margin of safety against the societal trends that are forever springing expensive surprises on the insurance industry. Setting a target of 100 can itself result in heavy losses; aiming for 110 - 115 is business suicide.\nAll of that said, what should the measure of an insurer's profitability be? Analysts and managers customarily look to the combined ratio - and it's true that this yardstick usually is a good indicator of where a company ranks in profitability. We believe a better measure, however, to be a comparison of underwriting loss to float developed.\nThis loss/float ratio, like any statistic used in evaluating insurance results, is meaningless over short time periods: Quarterly underwriting figures and even annual ones are too heavily based on estimates to be much good. But when the ratio takes in a period of years, it gives a rough indication of the cost of funds generated by insurance operations. A low cost of funds signifies a good business; a high cost translates into a poor business.\nOn the next page we show the underwriting loss, if any, of our insurance group in each year since we entered the business and relate that bottom line to the average float we have held during the year. From this data we have computed a \"cost of funds developed from insurance.\"\n(1)\n(2)\nYearend Yield\nUnderwriting\nApproximate\non Long-Term\nLoss\nAverage Float\nCost of Funds\nGovt.

At some insurers other items should enter into the calculation, but in our case these are unimportant and have been ignored.\nDuring 1990 we held about $1.6 billion of float slated eventually to find its way into the hands of others. The underwriting loss we sustained during the year was $27 million and thus our insurance operation produced funds for us at a cost of about 1.6%. As the table shows, we managed in some years to underwrite at a profit and in those instances our cost of funds was less than zero. In other years, such as 1984, we paid a very high price for float. In 19 years out of the 24 we have been in insurance, though, we have developed funds at a cost below that paid by the government.\nThere are two important qualifications to this calculation. First, the fat lady has yet to gargle, let alone sing, and we won't know our true 1967 - 1990 cost of funds until all losses from this period have been settled many decades from now. Second, the value of the float to shareholders is somewhat undercut by the fact that they must put up their own funds to support the insurance operation and are subject to double taxation on the investment income these funds earn. Direct investments would be more tax-efficient.\nThe tax penalty that indirect investments impose on shareholders is in fact substantial. Though the calculation is necessarily imprecise, I would estimate that the owners of the average insurance company would find the tax penalty adds about one percentage point to their cost of float. I also think that approximates the correct figure for Berkshire.\nFiguring a cost of funds for an insurance business allows anyone analyzing it to determine whether the operation has a positive or negative value for shareholders. If this cost (including the tax penalty) is higher than that applying to alternative sources of funds, the value is negative. If the cost is lower, the value is positive - and if the cost is significantly lower, the insurance business qualifies as a very valuable asset.\nSo far Berkshire has fallen into the significantly-lower camp. Even more dramatic are the numbers at GEICO, in which our ownership interest is now 48% and which customarily operates at an underwriting profit. GEICO's growth has generated an ever-larger amount of funds for investment that have an effective cost of considerably less than zero. Essentially, GEICO's policyholders, in aggregate, pay the company interest on the float rather than the other way around. (But handsome is as handsome does: GEICO's unusual profitability results from its extraordinary operating efficiency and its careful classification of risks, a package that in turn allows rock-bottom prices for policyholders.)\nMany well-known insurance companies, on the other hand, incur an underwriting loss/float cost that, combined with the tax penalty, produces negative results for owners. In addition, these companies, like all others in the industry, are vulnerable to catastrophe losses that could exceed their reinsurance protection and take their cost of float right off the chart. Unless these companies can materially improve their underwriting performance - and history indicates that is an almost impossible task - their shareholders will experience results similar to those borne by the owners of a bank that pays a higher rate of interest on deposits than it receives on loans.\nAll in all, the insurance business has treated us very well. We have expanded our float at a cost that on the average is reasonable, and we have further prospered because we have earned good returns on these low-cost funds. Our shareholders, true, have incurred extra taxes, but they have been more than compensated for this cost (so far) by the benefits produced by the float.\nA particularly encouraging point about our record is that it was achieved despite some colossal mistakes made by your Chairman prior to Mike Goldberg's arrival. Insurance offers a host of opportunities for error, and when opportunity knocked, too often I answered. Many years later, the bills keep arriving for these mistakes: In the insurance business, there is no statute of limitations on stupidity.\nThe intrinsic value of our insurance business will always be far more difficult to calculate than the value of, say, our candy or newspaper companies. By any measure, however, the business is worth far more than its carrying value. Furthermore, despite the problems this operation periodically hands us, it is the one - among all the fine businesses we own - that has the greatest potential.\nMarketable Securities\nBelow we list our common stock holdings having a value of over $100 million. A small portion of these investments belongs to subsidiaries of which Berkshire owns less than 100%.\n12/31/90\nShares\nCompany\nCost\nMarket\n------\n-------\n----------\n----------\n(000s omitted)\n3,000,000\nCapital Cities/ABC, Inc. ............ $\n517,500\n$1,377,375\n46,700,000\nThe Coca-Cola Co. ...................\n1,023,920\n2,171,550\n2,400,000\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. ....\n71,729\n117,000\n6,850,000\nGEICO Corp. .........................\n45,713\n1,110,556\n1,727,765\nThe Washington Post Company .........\n9,731\n342,097\n5,000,000\nWells Fargo & Company ...............\n289,431\n289,375\nLethargy bordering on sloth remains the cornerstone of our investment style: This year we neither bought nor sold a share of five of our six major holdings. The exception was Wells Fargo, a superbly-managed, high-return banking operation in which we increased our ownership to just under 10%, the most we can own without the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. About one-sixth of our position was bought in 1989, the rest in 1990.\nThe banking business is no favorite of ours. When assets are twenty times equity - a common ratio in this industry - mistakes that involve only a small portion of assets can destroy a major portion of equity. And mistakes have been the rule rather than the exception at many major banks. Most have resulted from a managerial failing that we described last year when discussing the \"institutional imperative:\" the tendency of executives to mindlessly imitate the behavior of their peers, no matter how foolish it may be to do so. In their lending, many bankers played follow-the-leader with lemming-like zeal; now they are experiencing a lemming-like fate.\nBecause leverage of 20:1 magnifies the effects of managerial strengths and weaknesses, we have no interest in purchasing shares of a poorly-managed bank at a \"cheap\" price. Instead, our only interest is in buying into well-managed banks at fair prices.\nWith Wells Fargo, we think we have obtained the best managers in the business, Carl Reichardt and Paul Hazen. In many ways the combination of Carl and Paul reminds me of another - Tom Murphy and Dan Burke at Capital Cities/ABC. First, each pair is stronger than the sum of its parts because each partner understands, trusts and admires the other. Second, both managerial teams pay able people well, but abhor having a bigger head count than is needed. Third, both attack costs as vigorously when profits are at record levels as when they are under pressure. Finally, both stick with what they understand and let their abilities, not their egos, determine what they attempt. (Thomas J. Watson Sr. of IBM followed the same rule: \"I'm no genius,\" he said. \"I'm smart in spots - but I stay around those spots.\")\nOur purchases of Wells Fargo in 1990 were helped by a chaotic market in bank stocks. The disarray was appropriate: Month by month the foolish loan decisions of once well-regarded banks were put on public display. As one huge loss after another was unveiled - often on the heels of managerial assurances that all was well - investors understandably concluded that no bank's numbers were to be trusted. Aided by their flight from bank stocks, we purchased our 10% interest in Wells Fargo for $290 million, less than five times after-tax earnings, and less than three times pre-tax earnings.\nWells Fargo is big - it has $56 billion in assets - and has been earning more than 20% on equity and 1.25% on assets. Our purchase of one-tenth of the bank may be thought of as roughly equivalent to our buying 100% of a $5 billion bank with identical financial characteristics. But were we to make such a purchase, we would have to pay about twice the $290 million we paid for Wells Fargo. Moreover, that $5 billion bank, commanding a premium price, would present us with another problem: We would not be able to find a Carl Reichardt to run it. In recent years, Wells Fargo executives have been more avidly recruited than any others in the banking business; no one, however, has been able to hire the dean.\nOf course, ownership of a bank - or about any other business - is far from riskless. California banks face the specific risk of a major earthquake, which might wreak enough havoc on borrowers to in turn destroy the banks lending to them. A second risk is systemic - the possibility of a business contraction or financial panic so severe that it would endanger almost every highly-leveraged institution, no matter how intelligently run. Finally, the market's major fear of the moment is that West Coast real estate values will tumble because of overbuilding and deliver huge losses to banks that have financed the expansion. Because it is a leading real estate lender, Wells Fargo is thought to be particularly vulnerable.\nNone of these eventualities can be ruled out. The probability of the first two occurring, however, is low and even a meaningful drop in real estate values is unlikely to cause major problems for well-managed institutions. Consider some mathematics: Wells Fargo currently earns well over $1 billion pre-tax annually after expensing more than $300 million for loan losses. If 10% of all $48 billion of the bank's loans - not just its real estate loans - were hit by problems in 1991, and these produced losses (including foregone interest) averaging 30% of principal, the company would roughly break even.\nA year like that - which we consider only a low-level possibility, not a likelihood - would not distress us. In fact, at Berkshire we would love to acquire businesses or invest in capital projects that produced no return for a year, but that could then be expected to earn 20% on growing equity. Nevertheless, fears of a California real estate disaster similar to that experienced in New England caused the price of Wells Fargo stock to fall almost 50% within a few months during 1990. Even though we had bought some shares at the prices prevailing before the fall, we welcomed the decline because it allowed us to pick up many more shares at the new, panic prices.\nInvestors who expect to be ongoing buyers of investments throughout their lifetimes should adopt a similar attitude toward market fluctuations; instead many illogically become euphoric when stock prices rise and unhappy when they fall. They show no such confusion in their reaction to food prices: Knowing they are forever going to be buyers of food, they welcome falling prices and deplore price increases. (It's the seller of food who doesn't like declining prices.) Similarly, at the Buffalo News we would cheer lower prices for newsprint - even though it would mean marking down the value of the large inventory of newsprint we always keep on hand - because we know we are going to be perpetually buying the product.\nIdentical reasoning guides our thinking about Berkshire's investments. We will be buying businesses - or small parts of businesses, called stocks - year in, year out as long as I live (and longer, if Berkshire's directors attend the seances I have scheduled). Given these intentions, declining prices for businesses benefit us, and rising prices hurt us.\nThe most common cause of low prices is pessimism - some times pervasive, some times specific to a company or industry. We want to do business in such an environment, not because we like pessimism but because we like the prices it produces. It's optimism that is the enemy of the rational buyer.\nNone of this means, however, that a business or stock is an intelligent purchase simply because it is unpopular; a contrarian approach is just as foolish as a follow-the-crowd strategy. What's required is thinking rather than polling. Unfortunately, Bertrand Russell's observation about life in general applies with unusual force in the financial world: \"Most men would rather die than think. Many do.\"\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nOur other major portfolio change last year was large additions to our holdings of RJR Nabisco bonds, securities that we first bought in late 1989. At yearend 1990 we had $440 million invested in these securities, an amount that approximated market value. (As I write this, however, their market value has risen by more than $150 million.)\nJust as buying into the banking business is unusual for us, so is the purchase of below-investment-grade bonds. But opportunities that interest us and that are also large enough to have a worthwhile impact on Berkshire's results are rare. Therefore, we will look at any category of investment, so long as we understand the business we're buying into and believe that price and value may differ significantly. (Woody Allen, in another context, pointed out the advantage of open-mindedness: \"I can't understand why more people aren't bi-sexual because it doubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.\")\nIn the past we have bought a few below-investment-grade bonds with success, though these were all old-fashioned \"fallen angels\" - bonds that were initially of investment grade but that were downgraded when the issuers fell on bad times. In the 1984 annual report we described our rationale for buying one fallen angel, the Washington Public Power Supply System.\nA kind of bastardized fallen angel burst onto the investment scene in the 1980s - \"junk bonds\" that were far below investment- grade when issued. As the decade progressed, new offerings of manufactured junk became ever junkier and ultimately the predictable outcome occurred: Junk bonds lived up to their name. In 1990 - even before the recession dealt its blows - the financial sky became dark with the bodies of failing corporations.\nThe disciples of debt assured us that this collapse wouldn't happen: Huge debt, we were told, would cause operating managers to focus their efforts as never before, much as a dagger mounted on the steering wheel of a car could be expected to make its driver proceed with intensified care. We'll acknowledge that such an attention-getter would produce a very alert driver. But another certain consequence would be a deadly - and unnecessary - accident if the car hit even the tiniest pothole or sliver of ice. The roads of business are riddled with potholes; a plan that requires dodging them all is a plan for disaster.\nIn the final chapter of The Intelligent Investor Ben Graham forcefully rejected the dagger thesis: \"Confronted with a challenge to distill the secret of sound investment into three words, we venture the motto, Margin of Safety.\" Forty-two years after reading that, I still think those are the right three words. The failure of investors to heed this simple message caused them staggering losses as the 1990s began.\nAt the height of the debt mania, capital structures were concocted that guaranteed failure: In some cases, so much debt was issued that even highly favorable business results could not produce the funds to service it. One particularly egregious \"kill- 'em-at-birth\" case a few years back involved the purchase of a mature television station in Tampa, bought with so much debt that the interest on it exceeded the station's gross revenues. Even if you assume that all labor, programs and services were donated rather than purchased, this capital structure required revenues to explode - or else the station was doomed to go broke. (Many of the bonds that financed the purchase were sold to now-failed savings and loan associations; as a taxpayer, you are picking up the tab for this folly.)\nAll of this seems impossible now. When these misdeeds were done, however, dagger-selling investment bankers pointed to the \"scholarly\" research of academics, which reported that over the years the higher interest rates received from low-grade bonds had more than compensated for their higher rate of default. Thus, said the friendly salesmen, a diversified portfolio of junk bonds would produce greater net returns than would a portfolio of high-grade bonds. (Beware of past-performance \"proofs\" in finance: If history books were the key to riches, the Forbes 400 would consist of librarians.)\nThere was a flaw in the salesmen's logic - one that a first- year student in statistics is taught to recognize. An assumption was being made that the universe of newly-minted junk bonds was identical to the universe of low-grade fallen angels and that, therefore, the default experience of the latter group was meaningful in predicting the default experience of the new issues. (That was an error similar to checking the historical death rate from Kool-Aid before drinking the version served at Jonestown.)\nThe universes were of course dissimilar in several vital respects. For openers, the manager of a fallen angel almost invariably yearned to regain investment-grade status and worked toward that goal. The junk-bond operator was usually an entirely different breed. Behaving much as a heroin user might, he devoted his energies not to finding a cure for his debt-ridden condition, but rather to finding another fix. Additionally, the fiduciary sensitivities of the executives managing the typical fallen angel were often, though not always, more finely developed than were those of the junk-bond-issuing financiopath.\nWall Street cared little for such distinctions. As usual, the Street's enthusiasm for an idea was proportional not to its merit, but rather to the revenue it would produce. Mountains of junk bonds were sold by those who didn't care to those who didn't think - and there was no shortage of either.\nJunk bonds remain a mine field, even at prices that today are often a small fraction of issue price. As we said last year, we have never bought a new issue of a junk bond. (The only time to buy these is on a day with no \"y\" in it.) We are, however, willing to look at the field, now that it is in disarray.\nIn the case of RJR Nabisco, we feel the Company's credit is considerably better than was generally perceived for a while and that the yield we receive, as well as the potential for capital gain, more than compensates for the risk we incur (though that is far from nil). RJR has made asset sales at favorable prices, has added major amounts of equity, and in general is being run well.\nHowever, as we survey the field, most low-grade bonds still look unattractive. The handiwork of the Wall Street of the 1980s is even worse than we had thought: Many important businesses have been mortally wounded. We will, though, keep looking for opportunities as the junk market continues to unravel.\nConvertible Preferred Stocks\nWe continue to hold the convertible preferred stocks described in earlier reports: $700 million of Salomon Inc, $600 million of The Gillette Company, $358 million of USAir Group, Inc. and $300 million of Champion International Corp. Our Gillette holdings will be converted into 12 million shares of common stock on April 1. Weighing interest rates, credit quality and prices of the related common stocks, we can assess our holdings in Salomon and Champion at yearend 1990 as worth about what we paid, Gillette as worth somewhat more, and USAir as worth substantially less.\nIn making the USAir purchase, your Chairman displayed exquisite timing: I plunged into the business at almost the exact moment that it ran into severe problems. (No one pushed me; in tennis parlance, I committed an \"unforced error.\") The company's troubles were brought on both by industry conditions and by the post-merger difficulties it encountered in integrating Piedmont, an affliction I should have expected since almost all airline mergers have been followed by operational turmoil.\nIn short order, Ed Colodny and Seth Schofield resolved the second problem: The airline now gets excellent marks for service. Industry-wide problems have proved to be far more serious. Since our purchase, the economics of the airline industry have deteriorated at an alarming pace, accelerated by the kamikaze pricing tactics of certain carriers. The trouble this pricing has produced for all carriers illustrates an important truth: In a business selling a commodity-type product, it's impossible to be a lot smarter than your dumbest competitor.\nHowever, unless the industry is decimated during the next few years, our USAir investment should work out all right. Ed and Seth have decisively addressed the current turbulence by making major changes in operations. Even so, our investment is now less secure than at the time I made it.\nOur convertible preferred stocks are relatively simple securities, yet I should warn you that, if the past is any guide, you may from time to time read inaccurate or misleading statements about them. Last year, for example, several members of the press calculated the value of all our preferreds as equal to that of the common stock into which they are convertible. By their logic, that is, our Salomon preferred, convertible into common at $38, would be worth 60% of face value if Salomon common were selling at $22.80. But there is a small problem with this line of reasoning: Using it, one must conclude that all of the value of a convertible preferred resides in the conversion privilege and that the value of a non-convertible preferred of Salomon would be zero, no matter what its coupon or terms for redemption.\nThe point you should keep in mind is that most of the value of our convertible preferreds is derived from their fixed-income characteristics. That means the securities cannot be worth less than the value they would possess as non-convertible preferreds and may be worth more because of their conversion options.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nI deeply regret having to end this section of the report with a note about my friend, Colman Mockler, Jr., CEO of Gillette, who died in January. No description better fitted Colman than \"gentleman\" - a word signifying integrity, courage and modesty. Couple these qualities with the humor and exceptional business ability that Colman possessed and you can understand why I thought it an undiluted pleasure to work with him and why I, and all others who knew him, will miss Colman so much.\nA few days before Colman died, Gillette was richly praised in a Forbes cover story. Its theme was simple: The company's success in shaving products has come not from marketing savvy (though it exhibits that talent repeatedly) but has instead resulted from its devotion to quality. This mind-set has caused it to consistently focus its energies on coming up with something better, even though its existing products already ranked as the class of the field. In so depicting Gillette, Forbes in fact painted a portrait of Colman.\nHelp! Help!\nRegular readers know that I shamelessly utilize the annual letter in an attempt to acquire businesses for Berkshire. And, as we constantly preach at the Buffalo News, advertising does work: Several businesses have knocked on our door because someone has read in these pages of our interest in making acquisitions. (Any good ad salesman will tell you that trying to sell something without advertising is like winking at a girl in the dark.)\nIn Appendix B (on pages 26-27) I've reproduced the essence of a letter I wrote a few years back to the owner/manager of a desirable business. If you have no personal connection with a business that might be of interest to us but have a friend who does, perhaps you can pass this report along to him.\nHere's the sort of business we are looking for:\n(1) Large purchases (at least $10 million of after-tax earnings),\n(2) Demonstrated consistent earning power (future projections are of little interest to us, nor are \"turnaround\" situations),\n(3) Businesses earning good returns on equity while employing little or no debt,\n(4) Management in place (we can't supply it),\n(5) Simple businesses (if there's lots of technology, we won't understand it),\n(6) An offering price (we don't want to waste our time or that of the seller by talking, even preliminarily, about a transaction when price is unknown).\nWe will not engage in unfriendly takeovers. We can promise complete confidentiality and a very fast answer - customarily within five minutes - as to whether we're interested. We prefer to buy for cash, but will consider issuing stock when we receive as much in intrinsic business value as we give.\nOur favorite form of purchase is one fitting the Blumkin- Friedman-Heldman mold. In cases like these, the company's owner- managers wish to generate significant amounts of cash, sometimes for themselves, but often for their families or inactive shareholders. At the same time, these managers wish to remain significant owners who continue to run their companies just as they have in the past. We think we offer a particularly good fit for owners with such objectives. We invite potential sellers to check us out by contacting people with whom we have done business in the past.\nCharlie and I frequently get approached about acquisitions that don't come close to meeting our tests: We've found that if you advertise an interest in buying collies, a lot of people will call hoping to sell you their cocker spaniels. A line from a country song expresses our feeling about new ventures, turnarounds, or auction-like sales: \"When the phone don't ring, you'll know it's me.\"\nBesides being interested in the purchase of businesses as described above, we are also interested in the negotiated purchase of large, but not controlling, blocks of stock comparable to those we hold in Capital Cities, Salomon, Gillette, USAir, and Champion. We are not interested, however, in receiving suggestions about purchases we might make in the general stock market.\nMiscellaneous\nKen Chace has decided not to stand for reelection as a director at our upcoming annual meeting. We have no mandatory retirement age for directors at Berkshire (and won't!), but Ken, at 75 and living in Maine, simply decided to cut back his activities.\nKen was my immediate choice to run the textile operation after Buffett Partnership, Ltd. assumed control of Berkshire early in 1965. Although I made an economic mistake in sticking with the textile business, I made no mistake in choosing Ken: He ran the operation well, he was always 100% straight with me about its problems, and he generated the funds that allowed us to diversify into insurance.\nMy wife, Susan, will be nominated to succeed Ken. She is now the second largest shareholder of Berkshire and if she outlives me will inherit all of my stock and effectively control the company. She knows, and agrees, with my thoughts on successor management and also shares my view that neither Berkshire nor its subsidiary businesses and important investments should be sold simply because some very high bid is received for one or all.\nI feel strongly that the fate of our businesses and their managers should not depend on my health - which, it should be added, is excellent - and I have planned accordingly. Neither my estate plan nor that of my wife is designed to preserve the family fortune; instead, both are aimed at preserving the character of Berkshire and returning the fortune to society.\nWere I to die tomorrow, you could be sure of three things: (1) None of my stock would have to be sold; (2) Both a controlling shareholder and a manager with philosophies similar to mine would follow me; and (3) Berkshire's earnings would increase by $1 million annually, since Charlie would immediately sell our corporate jet, The Indefensible (ignoring my wish that it be buried with me).\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAbout 97.3% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshire's 1990 shareholder-designated contributions program. Contributions made through the program were $5.8 million, and 2,600 charities were recipients.\nWe suggest that new shareholders read the description of our shareholder-designated contributions program that appears on pages 54-55. To participate in future programs, you must make sure your shares are registered in the name of the actual owner, not in the nominee name of a broker, bank or depository. Shares not so registered on August 31, 1991 will be ineligible for the 1991 program.\nIn addition to the shareholder-designated contributions that Berkshire distributes, managers of our operating businesses make contributions, including merchandise, averaging about $1.5 million annually. These contributions support local charities, such as The United Way, and produce roughly commensurate benefits for our businesses.\nHowever, neither our operating managers nor officers of the parent company use Berkshire funds to make contributions to broad national programs or charitable activities of special personal interest to them, except to the extent they do so as shareholders. If your employees, including your CEO, wish to give to their alma maters or other institutions to which they feel a personal attachment, we believe they should use their own money, not yours.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThe annual meeting this year will be held at the Orpheum Theater in downtown Omaha at 9:30 a.m. on Monday, April 29, 1991. Attendance last year grew to a record 1,300, about a 100-fold increase from ten years ago.\nWe recommend getting your hotel reservations early at one of these hotels: (1) The Radisson-Redick Tower, a small (88 rooms) but nice hotel across the street from the Orpheum; (2) the much larger Red Lion Hotel, located about a five-minute walk from the Orpheum; or (3) the Marriott, located in West Omaha about 100 yards from Borsheim's and a twenty minute drive from downtown. We will have buses at the Marriott that will leave at 8:30 and 8:45 for the meeting, and return after it ends.\nCharlie and I always enjoy the meeting, and we hope you can make it. The quality of our shareholders is reflected in the quality of the questions we get: We have never attended an annual meeting anywhere that features such a consistently high level of intelligent, owner-related questions.\nAn attachment to our proxy material explains how you can obtain the card you will need for admission to the meeting. Because weekday parking can be tight around the Orpheum, we have lined up a number of nearby lots for our shareholders to use. The attachment also contains information about them.\nAs usual, we will have buses to take you to Nebraska Furniture Mart and Borsheim's after the meeting and to take you to downtown hotels or to the airport later. I hope that you will allow plenty of time to fully explore the attractions of both stores. Those of you arriving early can visit the Furniture Mart any day of the week; it is open from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays, and from noon to 5:30 p.m. on Sundays. While there, stop at the See's Candy cart and see for yourself the dawn of synergism at Berkshire.\nBorsheim's normally is closed on Sunday, but we will open for shareholders and their guests from noon to 6 p.m. on Sunday, April 28. At our Sunday opening last year you made Ike very happy: After totaling the day's volume, he suggested to me that we start holding annual meetings quarterly. Join us at Borsheim's even if you just come to watch; it's a show you shouldn't miss.\nLast year the first question at the annual meeting was asked by 11-year-old Nicholas Kenner, a third-generation shareholder from New York City. Nicholas plays rough: \"How come the stock is down?\" he fired at me. My answer was not memorable.\nWe hope that other business engagements won't keep Nicholas away from this year's meeting. If he attends, he will be offered the chance to again ask the first question; Charlie and I want to tackle him while we're fresh. This year, however, it's Charlie's turn to answer.\nMarch 1, 1991\nWarren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board\nAPPENDIX A\nU. S. STEEL ANNOUNCES SWEEPING MODERNIZATION SCHEME*\n* An unpublished satire by Ben Graham, written in 1936 and given by the author to Warren Buffett in 1954.\nMyron C. Taylor, Chairman of U. S. Steel Corporation, today announced the long awaited plan for completely modernizing the world's largest industrial enterprise. Contrary to expectations, no changes will be made in the company's manufacturing or selling policies. Instead, the bookkeeping system is to be entirely revamped. By adopting and further improving a number of modern accounting and financial devices the corporation's earning power will be amazingly transformed. Even under the subnormal conditions of 1935, it is estimated that the new bookkeeping methods would have yielded a reported profit of close to $50 per share on the common stock. The scheme of improvement is the result of a comprehensive survey made by Messrs. Price, Bacon, Guthrie & Colpitts; it includes the following six points:\n1. Writing down of Plant Account to Minus $1,000,000,000.\n2. Par value of common stock to be reduced to 1¢.\n3. Payment of all wages and salaries in option warrants.\n4. Inventories to be carried at $1.\n5. Preferred Stock to be replaced by non-interest bearing bonds redeemable at 50% discount.\n6. A $1,000,000,000 Contingency Reserve to be established.\nThe official statement of this extraordinary Modernization Plan follows in full:\nThe Board of Directors of U. S. Steel Corporation is pleased to announce that after intensive study of the problems arising from changed conditions in the industry, it has approved a comprehensive plan for remodeling the Corporation's accounting methods. A survey by a Special Committee, aided and abetted by Messrs. Price, Bacon, Guthrie & Colpitts, revealed that our company has lagged somewhat behind other American business enterprises in utilizing certain advanced bookkeeping methods, by means of which the earning power may be phenomenally enhanced without requiring any cash outlay or any changes in operating or sales conditions. It has been decided not only to adopt these newer methods, but to develop them to a still higher stage of perfection. The changes adopted by the Board may be summarized under six heads, as follows:\n1. Fixed Assets to be written down to Minus $1,000,000,000.\nMany representative companies have relieved their income accounts of all charges for depreciation by writing down their plant account to $1. The Special Committee points out that if their plants are worth only $1, the fixed assets of U. S. Steel Corporation are worth a good deal less than that sum. It is now a well-recognized fact that many plants are in reality a liability rather than an asset, entailing not only depreciation charges, but taxes, maintenance, and other expenditures. Accordingly, the Board has decided to extend the write-down policy initiated in the 1935 report, and to mark down the Fixed Assets from $1,338,522,858.96 to a round Minus $1,000,000,000.\nThe advantages of this move should be evident. As the plant wears out, the liability becomes correspondingly reduced. Hence, instead of the present depreciation charge of some $47,000,000 yearly there will be an annual appreciation credit of 5%, or $50,000,000. This will increase earnings by no less than $97,000,000 per annum.\n2. Reduction of Par Value of Common Stock to 1¢, and\n3. Payment of Salaries and Wages in Option Warrants.\nMany corporations have been able to reduce their overhead expenses substantially by paying a large part of their executive salaries in the form of options to buy stock, which carry no charge against earnings. The full possibilities of this modern device have apparently not been adequately realized. The Board of Directors has adopted the following advanced form of this idea:\nThe entire personnel of the Corporation are to receive their compensation in the form of rights to buy common stock at $50 per share, at the rate of one purchase right for each $50 of salary and/or wages in their present amounts. The par value of the common stock is to be reduced to 1¢.\nThe almost incredible advantages of this new plan are evident from the following:\nA. The payroll of the Corporation will be entirely eliminated, a saving of $250,000,000 per annum, based on 1935 operations.\nB. At the same time, the effective compensation of all our employees will be increased severalfold. Because of the large earnings per share to be shown on our common stock under the new methods, it is certain that the shares will command a price in the market far above the option level of $50 per share, making the readily realizable value of these option warrants greatly in excess of the present cash wages that they will replace.\nC. The Corporation will realize an additional large annual profit through the exercise of these warrants. Since the par value of the common stock will be fixed at 1¢, there will be a gain of $49.99 on each share subscribed for. In the interest of conservative accounting, however, this profit will not be included in the income account, but will be shown separately as a credit to Capital Surplus.\nD. The Corporation's cash position will be enormously strengthened. In place of the present annual cash outgo of $250,000,000 for wages (1935 basis), there will be annual cash inflow of $250,000,000 through exercise of the subscription warrants for 5,000,000 shares of common stock. The Company's large earnings and strong cash position will permit the payment of a liberal dividend which, in turn, will result in the exercise of these option warrants immediately after issuance which, in turn, will further improve the cash position which, in turn, will permit a higher dividend rate -- and so on, indefinitely.\n4. Inventories to be carried at $1.\nSerious losses have been taken during the depression due to the necessity of adjusting inventory value to market. Various enterprises -- notably in the metal and cotton-textile fields -- have successfully dealt with this problem by carrying all or part of their inventories at extremely low unit prices. The U. S. Steel Corporation has decided to adopt a still more progressive policy, and to carry its entire inventory at $1. This will be effected by an appropriate write-down at the end of each year, the amount of said write-down to be charged to the Contingency Reserve hereinafter referred to.\nThe benefits to be derived from this new method are very great. Not only will it obviate all possibility of inventory depreciation, but it will substantially enhance the annual earnings of the Corporation. The inventory on hand at the beginning of the year, valued at $1, will be sold during the year at an excellent profit. It is estimated that our income will be increased by means of this method to the extent of at least $150,000,000 per annum which, by a coincidence, will about equal the amount of the write-down to be made each year against Contingency Reserve.\nA minority report of the Special Committee recommends that Accounts Receivable and Cash also be written down to $1, in the interest of consistency and to gain additional advantages similar to those just discussed. This proposal has been rejected for the time being because our auditors still require that any recoveries of receivables and cash so charged off be credited to surplus instead of to the year's income. It is expected, however, that this auditing rule -- which is rather reminiscent of the horse-and-buggy days -- will soon be changed in line with modern tendencies. Should this occur, the minority report will be given further and favorable consideration.\n5. Replacement of Preferred Stock by Non-Interest-Bearing Bonds Redeemable at 50% Discount.\nDuring the recent depression many companies have been able to offset their operating losses by including in income profits arising from repurchases of their own bonds at a substantial discount from par. Unfortunately the credit of U. S. Steel Corporation has always stood so high that this lucrative source of revenue has not hitherto been available to it. The Modernization Scheme will remedy this condition.\nIt is proposed that each share of preferred stock be exchanged for $300 face value of non-interest-bearing sinking-fund notes, redeemable by lot at 50% of face value in 10 equal annual installments. This will require the issuance of $1,080,000,000 of new notes, of which $108,000,000 will be retired each year at a cost to the Corporation of only $54,000,000, thus creating an annual profit of the same amount.\nLike the wage-and/or-salary plan described under 3. above, this arrangement will benefit both the Corporation and its preferred stockholders. The latter are assured payment for their present shares at 150% of par value over an average period of five years. Since short-term securities yield practically no return at present, the non-interest-bearing feature is of no real importance. The Corporation will convert its present annual charge of $25,000,000 for preferred dividends into an annual bond-retirement profit of $54,000,000 -- an aggregate yearly gain of $79,000,000.\n6. Establishment of a Contingency Reserve of $1,000,000,000.\nThe Directors are confident that the improvements hereinbefore described will assure the Corporation of a satisfactory earning power under all conditions in the future. Under modern accounting methods, however, it is unnecessary to incur the slightest risk of loss through adverse business developments of any sort, since all these may be provided for in advance by means of a Contingency Reserve.\nThe Special Committee has recommended that the Corporation create such a Contingency Reserve in the fairly substantial amount of $1,000,000,000. As previously set forth, the annual write-down of inventory to $1 will be absorbed by this reserve. To prevent eventual exhaustion of the Contingency Reserve, it has been further decided that it be replenished each year by transfer of an appropriate sum from Capital Surplus. Since the latter is expected to increase each year by not less than $250,000,000 through the exercise of the Stock Option Warrants (see 3. above), it will readily make good any drains on the Contingency Reserve.\nIn setting up this arrangement, the Board of Directors must confess regretfully that they have been unable to improve upon the devices already employed by important corporations in transferring large sums between Capital, Capital Surplus, Contingency Reserves and other Balance Sheet Accounts. In fact, it must be admitted that our entries will be somewhat too simple, and will lack that element of extreme mystification that characterizes the most advanced procedure in this field. The Board of Directors, however, have insisted upon clarity and simplicity in framing their Modernization Plan, even at the sacrifice of possible advantage to the Corporation's earning power.\nIn order to show the combined effect of the new proposals upon the Corporation's earning power, we submit herewith a condensed Income Account for 1935 on two bases, viz:\nB.

In view of the very large earning power that will result from these changes in the Corporation's Balance Sheet, it is not expected that undue attention will be paid to the details of assets and liabilities.\nIn conclusion, the Board desires to point out that the combined procedure, whereby plant will be carried at a minus figure, our wage bill will be eliminated, and inventory will stand on our books at virtually nothing, will give U. S. Steel Corporation an enormous competitive advantage in the industry. We shall be able to sell our products at exceedingly low prices and still show a handsome margin of profit. It is the considered view of the Board of Directors that under the Modernization Scheme we shall be able to undersell all competitors to such a point that the anti-trust laws will constitute the only barrier to 100% domination of the industry.\nIn making this statement, the Board is not unmindful of the possibility that some of our competitors may seek to offset our new advantages by adopting similar accounting improvements. We are confident, however, that U. S. Steel will be able to retain the loyalty of its customers, old and new, through the unique prestige that will accrue to it as the originator and pioneer in these new fields of service to the user of steel. Should necessity arise, moreover, we believe we shall be able to maintain our deserved superiority by introducing still more advanced bookkeeping methods, which are even now under development in our Experimental Accounting Laboratory.\nAPPENDIX B\nSome Thoughts on Selling Your Business*\n*This is an edited version of a letter I sent some years ago to a man who had indicated that he might want to sell his family business. I present it here because it is a message I would like to convey to other prospective sellers. -- W.E.B.\nDear _____________:\nHere are a few thoughts pursuant to our conversation of the other day.\nMost business owners spend the better part of their lifetimes building their businesses. By experience built upon endless repetition, they sharpen their skills in merchandising, purchasing, personnel selection, etc. It's a learning process, and mistakes made in one year often contribute to competence and success in succeeding years.\nIn contrast, owner-managers sell their business only once -- frequently in an emotionally-charged atmosphere with a multitude of pressures coming from different directions. Often, much of the pressure comes from brokers whose compensation is contingent upon consummation of a sale, regardless of its consequences for both buyer and seller. The fact that the decision is so important, both financially and personally, to the owner can make the process more, rather than less, prone to error. And, mistakes made in the once-in-a-lifetime sale of a business are not reversible.\nPrice is very important, but often is not the most critical aspect of the sale. You and your family have an extraordinary business -- one of a kind in your field -- and any buyer is going to recognize that. It's also a business that is going to get more valuable as the years go by. So if you decide not to sell now, you are very likely to realize more money later on. With that knowledge you can deal from strength and take the time required to select the buyer you want.\nIf you should decide to sell, I think Berkshire Hathaway offers some advantages that most other buyers do not. Practically all of these buyers will fall into one of two categories:\n(1) A company located elsewhere but operating in your business or in a business somewhat akin to yours. Such a buyer -- no matter what promises are made -- will usually have managers who feel they know how to run your business operations and, sooner or later, will want to apply some hands-on \"help.\" If the acquiring company is much larger, it often will have squads of managers, recruited over the years in part by promises that they will get to run future acquisitions. They will have their own way of doing things and, even though your business record undoubtedly will be far better than theirs, human nature will at some point cause them to believe that their methods of operating are superior. You and your family probably have friends who have sold their businesses to larger companies, and I suspect that their experiences will confirm the tendency of parent companies to take over the running of their subsidiaries, particularly when the parent knows the industry, or thinks it does.\n(2) A financial maneuverer, invariably operating with large amounts of borrowed money, who plans to resell either to the public or to another corporation as soon as the time is favorable. Frequently, this buyer's major contribution will be to change accounting methods so that earnings can be presented in the most favorable light just prior to his bailing out. I'm enclosing a recent article that describes this sort of transaction, which is becoming much more frequent because of a rising stock market and the great supply of funds available for such transactions.\nIf the sole motive of the present owners is to cash their chips and put the business behind them -- and plenty of sellers fall in this category -- either type of buyer that I've just described is satisfactory. But if the sellers' business represents the creative work of a lifetime and forms an integral part of their personality and sense of being, buyers of either type have serious flaws.\nBerkshire is another kind of buyer -- a rather unusual one. We buy to keep, but we don't have, and don't expect to have, operating people in our parent organization. All of the businesses we own are run autonomously to an extraordinary degree. In most cases, the managers of important businesses we have owned for many years have not been to Omaha or even met each other. When we buy a business, the sellers go on running it just as they did before the sale; we adapt to their methods rather than vice versa.\nWe have no one -- family, recently recruited MBAs, etc. -- to whom we have promised a chance to run businesses we have bought from owner-managers. And we won't have.\nYou know of some of our past purchases. I'm enclosing a list of everyone from whom we have ever bought a business, and I invite you to check with them as to our performance versus our promises. You should be particularly interested in checking with the few whose businesses did not do well in order to ascertain how we behaved under difficult conditions.\nAny buyer will tell you that he needs you personally -- and if he has any brains, he most certainly does need you. But a great many buyers, for the reasons mentioned above, don't match their subsequent actions to their earlier words. We will behave exactly as promised, both because we have so promised, and because we need to in order to achieve the best business results.\nThis need explains why we would want the operating members of your family to retain a 20% interest in the business. We need 80% to consolidate earnings for tax purposes, which is a step important to us. It is equally important to us that the family members who run the business remain as owners. Very simply, we would not want to buy unless we felt key members of present management would stay on as our partners. Contracts cannot guarantee your continued interest; we would simply rely on your word.\nThe areas I get involved in are capital allocation and selection and compensation of the top man. Other personnel decisions, operating strategies, etc. are his bailiwick. Some Berkshire managers talk over some of their decisions with me; some don't. It depends upon their personalities and, to an extent, upon their own personal relationship with me.\nIf you should decide to do business with Berkshire, we would pay in cash. Your business would not be used as collateral for any loan by Berkshire. There would be no brokers involved.\nFurthermore, there would be no chance that a deal would be announced and that the buyer would then back off or start suggesting adjustments (with apologies, of course, and with an explanation that banks, lawyers, boards of directors, etc. were to be blamed). And finally, you would know exactly with whom you are dealing. You would not have one executive negotiate the deal only to have someone else in charge a few years later, or have the president regretfully tell you that his board of directors required this change or that (or possibly required sale of your business to finance some new interest of the parent's).\nIt's only fair to tell you that you would be no richer after the sale than now. The ownership of your business already makes you wealthy and soundly invested. A sale would change the form of your wealth, but it wouldn't change its amount. If you sell, you will have exchanged a 100%-owned valuable asset that you understand for another valuable asset -- cash -- that will probably be invested in small pieces (stocks) of other businesses that you understand less well. There is often a sound reason to sell but, if the transaction is a fair one, the reason is not so that the seller can become wealthier.\nI will not pester you; if you have any possible interest in selling, I would appreciate your call. I would be extraordinarily proud to have Berkshire, along with the key members of your family, own _______; I believe we would do very well financially; and I believe you would have just as much fun running the business over the next 20 years as you have had during the past 20.\nSincerely,\n/s/ Warren E. Buffett",

    "text": "Chairman's Letter - 1991\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOur gain in net worth during 1991 was $2.1 billion, or\n39.6%. Over the last 27 years (that is, since present management\ntook over) our per-share book value has grown from $19 to $6,437,\nor at a rate of 23.7% compounded annually.\nThe size of our equity capital - which now totals $7.4\nbillion - makes it certain that we cannot maintain our past rate\nof gain or, for that matter, come close to doing so. As Berkshire\ngrows, the universe of opportunities that can significantly\ninfluence the company's performance constantly shrinks. When we\nwere working with capital of $20 million, an idea or business\nproducing $1 million of profit added five percentage points to\nour return for the year. Now we need a $370 million idea (i.e.,\none contributing over $550 million of pre-tax profit) to achieve\nthe same result. And there are many more ways to make $1 million\nthan to make $370 million.\nCharlie Munger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman, and I have set a\ngoal of attaining a 15% average annual increase in Berkshire's\nintrinsic value. If our growth in book value is to keep up with a\n15% pace, we must earn $22 billion during the next decade. Wish\nus luck - we'll need it.\nOur outsized gain in book value in 1991 resulted from a\nphenomenon not apt to be repeated:\na dramatic rise in the price-\nearnings ratios of Coca-Cola and Gillette. These two stocks\naccounted for nearly $1.6 billion of our $2.1 billion growth in\nnet worth last year. When we loaded up on Coke three years ago,\nBerkshire's net worth was $3.4 billion; now our Coke stock alone\nis worth more than that.\nCoca-Cola and Gillette are two of the best companies in the\nworld and we expect their earnings to grow at hefty rates in the\nyears ahead. Over time, also, the value of our holdings in these\nstocks should grow in rough proportion. Last year, however, the\nvaluations of these two companies rose far faster than their\nearnings. In effect, we got a double-dip benefit, delivered\npartly by the excellent earnings growth and even more so by the\nmarket's reappraisal of these stocks. We believe this reappraisal\nwas warranted. But it can't recur annually:\nWe'll have to settle\nfor a single dip in the future.\nA Second Job\nIn 1989 when I - a happy consumer of five cans of Cherry\nCoke daily - announced our purchase of $1 billion worth of Coca-\nCola stock, I described the move as a rather extreme example of\nputting our money where my mouth was. On August 18 of last year,\nwhen I was elected Interim Chairman of Salomon Inc, it was a\ndifferent story: I put my mouth where our money was.\nYou've all read of the events that led to my appointment. My\ndecision to take the job carried with it an implicit but\nimportant message: Berkshire's operating managers are so\noutstanding that I knew I could materially reduce the time I was\nspending at the company and yet remain confident that its\neconomic progress would not skip a beat. The Blumkins, the\nFriedman family, Mike Goldberg, the Heldmans, Chuck Huggins, Stan\nLipsey, Ralph Schey and Frank Rooney (CEO of H.H. Brown, our\nlatest acquisition, which I will describe later) are all masters\nof their operations and need no help from me. My job is merely to\ntreat them right and to allocate the capital they generate.\nNeither function is impeded by my work at Salomon.\nThe role that Charlie and I play in the success of our\noperating units can be illustrated by a story about\nGeorge Mira,\nthe one-time quarterback of the University of Miami, and his\ncoach, Andy Gustafson. Playing Florida and near its goal line,\nMira dropped back to pass. He spotted an open receiver but found\nhis right shoulder in the unshakable grasp of a Florida\nlinebacker. The right-handed Mira thereupon switched the ball to\nhis other hand and threw the only left-handed pass of his life -\nfor a touchdown. As the crowd erupted, Gustafson calmly turned to\na reporter and declared: \"Now that's what I call coaching.\"\nGiven the managerial stars we have at our operating units,\nBerkshire's performance is not affected if Charlie or I slip away\nfrom time to time. You should note, however, the \"interim\" in my\nSalomon title. Berkshire is my first love and one that will never\nfade: At the Harvard Business School last year, a student asked\nme when I planned to retire and I replied, \"About five to ten\nyears after I die.\"\nSources of Reported Earnings\nThe table below shows the major sources of Berkshire's\nreported earnings. In this presentation, amortization of Goodwill\nand other major purchase-price accounting adjustments are not\ncharged against the specific businesses to which they apply, but\nare instead aggregated and shown separately. This procedure lets\nyou view the earnings of our businesses as they would have been\nreported had we not purchased them. I've explained in past\nreports why this form of presentation seems to us to be more\nuseful to investors and managers than one utilizing generally\naccepted accounting principles (GAAP), which require purchase-\nprice adjustments to be made on a business-by-business basis. The\ntotal net earnings we show in the table are, of course, identical\nto the GAAP total in our audited financial statements.\nA large amount of additional information about these\nbusinesses is given on pages 33-47, where you also will find\nour segment earnings reported on a GAAP basis. However, we will\nnot in this letter discuss each of our non-insurance operations,\nas we have in the past. Our businesses have grown in number - and\nwill continue to grow - so it now makes sense to rotate coverage,\ndiscussing one or two in detail each year.\n(000s omitted)\n----------------------------------------------\nBerkshire's Share\nof Net Earnings\n(after taxes and\nPre-Tax Earnings\nminority interests)\n----------------------\n----------------------\n1991\n1990\n1991\n1990\n----------\n----------\n----------\n----------\nOperating Earnings:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting ............ $(119,593)\n$ (26,647)\n$ (77,229)\n$ (14,936)\nNet Investment Income ...\n331,846\n327,047\n285,173\n282,613\nH.

Indeed, since present management took over in\n1965, our look-through earnings have grown at almost the identical\n23% rate of gain recorded for book value.\nLast year, however, our look-through earnings did not grow at\nall but rather declined by 14%. To an extent, the decline was\nprecipitated by two forces that I discussed in last year's report\nand that I warned you would have a negative effect on look-through\nearnings.\nFirst, I told you that our media earnings - both direct and\nlook-through - were \"sure to decline\" and they in fact did. The\nsecond force came into play on April 1, when the call of our\nGillette preferred stock required us to convert it into common. The\nafter-tax earnings in 1990 from our preferred had been about $45\nmillion, an amount somewhat higher than the combination in 1991 of\nthree months of dividends on our preferred plus nine months of\nlook-through earnings on the common.\nTwo other outcomes that I did not foresee also hurt look-\nthrough earnings in 1991. First, we had a break-even result from\nour interest in Wells Fargo (dividends we received from the company\nwere offset by negative retained earnings). Last year I said that\nsuch a result at Wells was \"a low-level possibility - not a\nlikelihood.\" Second, we recorded significantly lower - though still\nexcellent - insurance profits.\nThe following table shows you how we calculate look-through\nearnings, although I warn you that the figures are necessarily very\nrough. (The dividends paid to us by these investees have been\nincluded in the operating earnings itemized on page 6, mostly\nunder \"Insurance Group: Net Investment Income.\")\nBerkshire's Share\nof Undistributed\nBerkshire's Approximate\nOperating Earnings\nBerkshire's Major Investees\nOwnership at Yearend\n(in millions)\n---------------------------\n-----------------------\n------------------\n1991\n1990\n1991\n1990\n------\n------\n--------\n--------\nCapital Cities/ABC Inc. ........\n18.1%\n17.9%\n$ 61\n$ 85\nThe Coca-Cola Company ..........\n7.0%\n7.0%\n69\n58\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.\n3.4%(1)\n3.2%(1)\n15\n10\nThe Gillette Company ...........\n11.0%\n---\n23(2)\n---\nGEICO Corp. ....................\n48.2%\n46.1%\n69\n76\nThe Washington Post Company ....\n14.6%\n14.6%\n10\n18\nWells Fargo & Company ..........\n9.6%\n9.7%\n(17)\n19(3)\n--------\n--------\nBerkshire's share of\nundistributed earnings of major investees\n$230\n$266\nHypothetical tax on these undistributed investee earnings\n(30)\n(35)\nReported operating earnings of Berkshire\n316\n371\n--------\n--------\nTotal look-through earnings of Berkshire\n$516\n$602\n========\n========\n(1) Net of minority interest at Wesco\n(2) For the nine months after Berkshire converted its\npreferred on April 1\n(3) Calculated on average ownership for the year\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nWe also believe that investors can benefit by focusing on\ntheir own look-through earnings. To calculate these, they should\ndetermine the underlying earnings attributable to the shares they\nhold in their portfolio and total these. The goal of each investor\nshould be to create a portfolio (in effect, a \"company\") that will\ndeliver him or her the highest possible look-through earnings a\ndecade or so from now.\nAn approach of this kind will force the investor to think\nabout long-term business prospects rather than short-term stock\nmarket prospects, a perspective likely to improve results. It's\ntrue, of course, that, in the long run, the scoreboard for\ninvestment decisions is market price. But prices will be determined\nby future earnings. In investing, just as in baseball, to put runs\non the scoreboard one must watch the playing field, not the\nscoreboard.\nA Change in Media Economics and Some Valuation Math\nIn last year's report, I stated my opinion that the decline in\nthe profitability of media companies reflected secular as well as\ncyclical factors. The events of 1991 have fortified that case: The\neconomic strength of once-mighty media enterprises continues to\nerode as retailing patterns change and advertising and\nentertainment choices proliferate. In the business world,\nunfortunately, the rear-view mirror is always clearer than the\nwindshield: A few years back no one linked to the media business -\nneither lenders, owners nor financial analysts - saw the economic\ndeterioration that was in store for the industry. (But give me a\nfew years and I'll probably convince myself that I did.)\nThe fact is that newspaper, television, and magazine\nproperties have begun to resemble businesses more than franchises\nin their economic behavior. Let's take a quick look at the\ncharacteristics separating these two classes of enterprise, keeping\nin mind, however, that many operations fall in some middle ground\nand can best be described as weak franchises or strong businesses.\nAn economic franchise arises from a product or service that:\n(1) is needed or desired; (2) is thought by its customers to have\nno close substitute and; (3) is not subject to price regulation.\nThe existence of all three conditions will be demonstrated by a\ncompany's ability to regularly price its product or service\naggressively and thereby to earn high rates of return on capital.\nMoreover, franchises can tolerate mis-management. Inept managers\nmay diminish a franchise's profitability, but they cannot inflict\nmortal damage.\nIn contrast, \"a business\" earns exceptional profits only if it\nis the low-cost operator or if supply of its product or service is\ntight. Tightness in supply usually does not last long. With\nsuperior management, a company may maintain its status as a low-\ncost operator for a much longer time, but even then unceasingly\nfaces the possibility of competitive attack. And a business, unlike\na franchise, can be killed by poor management.\nUntil recently, media properties possessed the three\ncharacteristics of a franchise and consequently could both price\naggressively and be managed loosely. Now, however, consumers\nlooking for information and entertainment (their primary interest\nbeing the latter) enjoy greatly broadened choices as to where to\nfind them. Unfortunately, demand can't expand in response to this\nnew supply: 500 million American eyeballs and a 24-hour day are all\nthat's available. The result is that competition has intensified,\nmarkets have fragmented, and the media industry has lost some -\nthough far from all - of its franchise strength.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThe industry's weakened franchise has an impact on its value\nthat goes far beyond the immediate effect on earnings. For an\nunderstanding of this phenomenon, let's look at some much over-\nsimplified, but relevant, math.\nA few years ago the conventional wisdom held that a newspaper,\ntelevision or magazine property would forever increase its earnings\nat 6% or so annually and would do so without the employment of\nadditional capital, for the reason that depreciation charges would\nroughly match capital expenditures and working capital requirements\nwould be minor. Therefore, reported earnings (before amortization\nof intangibles) were also freely-distributable earnings, which\nmeant that ownership of a media property could be construed as akin\nto owning a perpetual annuity set to grow at 6% a year. Say, next,\nthat a discount rate of 10% was used to determine the present value\nof that earnings stream. One could then calculate that it was\nappropriate to pay a whopping $25 million for a property with\ncurrent after-tax earnings of $1 million. (This after-tax multiplier\nof 25 translates to a multiplier on pre-tax earnings of about 16.)\nNow change the assumption and posit that the $1 million\nrepresents \"normal earning power\" and that earnings will bob around\nthis figure cyclically. A \"bob-around\" pattern is indeed the lot of\nmost businesses, whose income stream grows only if their owners are\nwilling to commit more capital (usually in the form of retained\nearnings). Under our revised assumption, $1 million of earnings,\ndiscounted by the same 10%, translates to a $10 million valuation.\nThus a seemingly modest shift in assumptions reduces the property's\nvaluation to 10 times after-tax earnings (or about 6 1/2 times\npre-tax earnings).\nDollars are dollars whether they are derived from the\noperation of media properties or of steel mills. What in the past\ncaused buyers to value a dollar of earnings from media far higher\nthan a dollar from steel was that the earnings of a media property\nwere expected to constantly grow (without the business requiring\nmuch additional capital), whereas steel earnings clearly fell in\nthe bob-around category. Now, however, expectations for media have\nmoved toward the bob-around model. And, as our simplified example\nillustrates, valuations must change dramatically when expectations\nare revised.\nWe have a significant investment in media - both through our\ndirect ownership of Buffalo News and our shareholdings in The\nWashington Post Company and Capital Cities/ABC - and the intrinsic\nvalue of this investment has declined materially because of the\nsecular transformation that the industry is experiencing. (Cyclical\nfactors have also hurt our current look-through earnings, but these\nfactors do not reduce intrinsic value.) However, as our Business\nPrinciples on page 2-3 note, one of the rules by which we run\nBerkshire is that we do not sell businesses - or investee holdings\nthat we have classified as permanent - simply because we see ways\nto use the money more advantageously elsewhere. (We did sell\ncertain other media holdings sometime back, but these were\nrelatively small.)\nThe intrinsic value losses that we have suffered have been\nmoderated because the Buffalo News, under Stan Lipsey's leadership,\nhas done far better than most newspapers and because both Cap\nCities and Washington Post are exceptionally well-managed. In\nparticular, these companies stayed on the sidelines during the late\n1980's period in which purchasers of media properties regularly\npaid irrational prices. Also, the debt of both Cap Cities and\nWashington Post is small and roughly offset by cash that they hold.\nAs a result, the shrinkage in the value of their assets has not\nbeen accentuated by the effects of leverage. Among publicly-owned\nmedia companies, our two investees are about the only ones\nessentially free of debt. Most of the other companies, through a\ncombination of the aggressive acquisition policies they pursued and\nshrinking earnings, find themselves with debt equal to five or more\ntimes their current net income.\nThe strong balance sheets and strong managements of Cap Cities\nand Washington Post leave us more comfortable with these\ninvestments than we would be with holdings in any other media\ncompanies. Moreover, most media properties continue to have far\nbetter economic characteristics than those possessed by the average\nAmerican business. But gone are the days of bullet-proof franchises\nand cornucopian economics.\nTwenty Years in a Candy Store\nWe've just passed a milestone: Twenty years ago, on January 3,\n1972, Blue Chip Stamps (then an affiliate of Berkshire and later\nmerged into it) bought control of See's Candy Shops, a West Coast\nmanufacturer and retailer of boxed-chocolates. The nominal price\nthat the sellers were asking - calculated on the 100% ownership we\nultimately attained - was $40 million. But the company had $10\nmillion of excess cash, and therefore the true offering price was\n$30 million. Charlie and I, not yet fully appreciative of the value\nof an economic franchise, looked at the company's mere $7 million\nof tangible net worth and said $25 million was as high as we would\ngo (and we meant it). Fortunately, the sellers accepted our offer.\nThe sales of trading stamps by Blue Chip thereafter declined\nfrom $102.5 million in 1972 to $1.2 million in 1991. But See's\ncandy sales in the same period increased from $29 million to $196\nmillion. Moreover, profits at See's grew even faster than sales,\nfrom $4.2 million pre-tax in 1972 to $42.4 million last year.\nFor an increase in profits to be evaluated properly, it must\nbe compared with the incremental capital investment required to\nproduce it. On this score, See's has been astounding: The company\nnow operates comfortably with only $25 million of net worth, which\nmeans that our beginning base of $7 million has had to be\nsupplemented by only $18 million of reinvested earnings. Meanwhile,\nSee's remaining pre-tax profits of $410 million were distributed to\nBlue Chip/Berkshire during the 20 years for these companies to\ndeploy (after payment of taxes) in whatever way made most sense.\nIn our See's purchase, Charlie and I had one important\ninsight: We saw that the business had untapped pricing power.\nOtherwise, we were lucky twice over. First, the transaction was not\nderailed by our dumb insistence on a $25 million price. Second, we\nfound Chuck Huggins, then See's executive vice-president, whom we\ninstantly put in charge. Both our business and personal experiences\nwith Chuck have been outstanding. One example: When the purchase\nwas made, we shook hands with Chuck on a compensation arrangement -\nconceived in about five minutes and never reduced to a written\ncontract - that remains unchanged to this day.\nIn 1991, See's sales volume, measured in dollars, matched that\nof 1990. In pounds, however, volume was down 4%. All of that\nslippage took place in the last two months of the year, a period\nthat normally produces more than 80% of annual profits. Despite the\nweakness in sales, profits last year grew 7%, and our pre-tax\nprofit margin was a record 21.6%.\nAlmost 80% of See's sales come from California and our\nbusiness clearly was hurt by the recession, which hit the state\nwith particular force late in the year. Another negative, however,\nwas the mid-year initiation in California of a sales tax of 7%-8«%\n(depending on the county involved) on \"snack food\" that was deemed\napplicable to our candy.\nShareholders who are students of epistemological shadings will\nenjoy California's classifications of \"snack\" and \"non-snack\"\nfoods:\nTaxable \"Snack\" Foods\nNon-Taxable \"Non-Snack\" Foods\n---------------------\n-----------------------------\nRitz Crackers\nSoda Crackers\nPopped Popcorn\nUnpopped Popcorn\nGranola Bars\nGranola Cereal\nSlice of Pie (Wrapped)\nWhole Pie\nMilky Way Candy Bar\nMilky Way Ice Cream Bar\nWhat - you are sure to ask - is the tax status of a melted\nMilky Way ice cream bar? In that androgynous form, does it more\nresemble an ice cream bar or a candy bar that has been left in the\nsun?\nIt's no wonder that Brad Sherman, Chairman of California's\nState Board of Equalization, who opposed the snack food bill but\nmust now administer it, has said: \"I came to this job as a\nspecialist in tax law. Now I find my constituents should have\nelected Julia Child.\"\nCharlie and I have many reasons to be thankful for our\nassociation with Chuck and See's. The obvious ones are that we've\nearned exceptional returns and had a good time in the process.\nEqually important, ownership of See's has taught us much about the\nevaluation of franchises. We've made significant money in certain\ncommon stocks because of the lessons we learned at See's.\nH. H. Brown\nWe made a sizable acquisition in 1991 - the H. H. Brown\nCompany - and behind this business is an interesting history. In\n1927 a 29-year-old businessman named Ray Heffernan purchased the\ncompany, then located in North Brookfield, Massachusetts, for\n$10,000 and began a 62-year career of running it. (He also found\ntime for other pursuits: At age 90 he was still joining new golf\nclubs.) By Mr. Heffernan's retirement in early 1990 H. H. Brown had\nthree plants in the United States and one in Canada; employed close\nto 2,000 people; and earned about $25 million annually before\ntaxes.\nAlong the way, Frances Heffernan, one of Ray's daughters,\nmarried Frank Rooney, who was sternly advised by Mr. Heffernan\nbefore the wedding that he had better forget any ideas he might\nhave about working for his father-in-law. That was one of Mr.\nHeffernan's few mistakes: Frank went on to become CEO of Melville\nShoe (now Melville Corp.). During his 23 years as boss, from 1964\nthrough 1986, Melville's earnings averaged more than 20% on equity\nand its stock (adjusted for splits) rose from $16 to $960. And a\nfew years after Frank retired, Mr. Heffernan, who had fallen ill,\nasked him to run Brown.\nAfter Mr. Heffernan died late in 1990, his family decided to\nsell the company - and here we got lucky. I had known Frank for a\nfew years but not well enough for him to think of Berkshire as a\npossible buyer. He instead gave the assignment of selling Brown to\na major investment banker, which failed also to think of us. But\nlast spring Frank was playing golf in Florida with John Loomis, a\nlong-time friend of mine as well as a Berkshire shareholder, who is\nalways on the alert for something that might fit us. Hearing about\nthe impending sale of Brown, John told Frank that the company\nshould be right up Berkshire's alley, and Frank promptly gave me a\ncall. I thought right away that we would make a deal and before\nlong it was done.\nMuch of my enthusiasm for this purchase came from Frank's\nwillingness to continue as CEO. Like most of our managers, he has\nno financial need to work but does so because he loves the game and\nlikes to excel. Managers of this stripe cannot be \"hired\" in the\nnormal sense of the word. What we must do is provide a concert hall\nin which business artists of this class will wish to perform.\nBrown (which, by the way, has no connection to Brown Shoe of\nSt. Louis) is the leading North American manufacturer of work shoes\nand boots, and it has a history of earning unusually fine margins\non sales and assets. Shoes are a tough business - of the billion\npairs purchased in the United States each year, about 85% are\nimported\n- and most manufacturers in the industry do poorly. The\nwide range of styles and sizes that producers offer causes\ninventories to be heavy; substantial capital is also tied up in\nreceivables. In this kind of environment, only outstanding managers\nlike Frank and the group developed by Mr. Heffernan can prosper.\nA distinguishing characteristic of H. H. Brown is one of the\nmost unusual compensation systems I've encountered - but one that\nwarms my heart: A number of key managers are paid an annual salary\nof $7,800, to which is added a designated percentage of the profits\nof the company after these are reduced by a charge for capital\nemployed. These managers therefore truly stand in the shoes of\nowners. In contrast, most managers talk the talk but don't walk the\nwalk, choosing instead to employ compensation systems that are long\non carrots but short on sticks (and that almost invariably treat\nequity capital as if it were cost-free).\nThe arrangement at Brown,\nin any case, has served both the company and its managers\nexceptionally well, which should be no surprise:\nManagers eager to\nbet heavily on their abilities usually have plenty of ability to\nbet on.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIt's discouraging to note that though we have on four\noccasions made major purchases of companies whose sellers were\nrepresented by prominent investment banks, we were in only one of\nthese instances contacted by the investment bank. In the other\nthree cases, I myself or a friend initiated the transaction at some\npoint after the investment bank had solicited its own list of\nprospects. We would love to see an intermediary earn its fee by\nthinking of us - and therefore repeat here what we're looking for:\n(1) Large purchases (at least $10 million of after-tax\nearnings),\n(2) Demonstrated consistent earning power (future projections\nare of little interest to us, nor are \"turnaround\"\nsituations),\n(3) Businesses earning good returns on equity while employing\nlittle or no debt,\n(4) Management in place (we can't supply it),\n(5) Simple businesses (if there's lots of technology, we\nwon't understand it),\n(6) An offering price (we don't want to waste our time or\nthat of the seller by talking, even preliminarily,\nabout a transaction when price is unknown).\nWe will not engage in unfriendly takeovers. We can promise\ncomplete confidentiality and a very fast answer - customarily\nwithin five minutes - as to whether we're interested. (With Brown,\nwe didn't even need to take five.) We prefer to buy for cash, but\nwill consider issuing stock when we receive as much in intrinsic\nbusiness value as we give.\nOur favorite form of purchase is one fitting the pattern\nthrough which we acquired Nebraska Furniture Mart, Fechheimer's and\nBorsheim's. In cases like these, the company's owner-managers wish\nto generate significant amounts of cash, sometimes for themselves,\nbut often for their families or inactive shareholders.\nAt the same\ntime, these managers wish to remain significant owners who continue\nto run their companies just as they have in the past. We think we\noffer a particularly good fit for owners with such objectives and\nwe invite potential sellers to check us out by contacting people\nwith whom we have done business in the past.\nCharlie and I frequently get approached about acquisitions\nthat don't come close to meeting our tests:\nWe've found that if\nyou advertise an interest in buying collies, a lot of people will\ncall hoping to sell you their cocker spaniels. A line from a\ncountry song expresses our feeling about new ventures, turnarounds,\nor auction-like sales: \"When the phone don't ring, you'll know it's\nme.\"\nBesides being interested in the purchase of businesses as\ndescribed above, we are also interested in the negotiated purchase\nof large, but not controlling, blocks of stock comparable to those\nwe hold in Capital Cities, Salomon, Gillette, USAir, Champion, and\nAmerican Express. We are not interested, however, in receiving\nsuggestions about purchases we might make in the general stock\nmarket.\nInsurance Operations\nShown below is an updated version of our usual table\npresenting key figures for the property-casualty insurance\nindustry:\nYearly Change\nCombined Ratio\nYearly Change\nInflation Rate\nin Premiums\nAfter Policyholder\nin Incurred\nMeasured by\nWritten (%)\nDividends\nLosses (%)\nGDP Deflator (%)\n-------------\n------------------\n-------------\n----------------\n1981 .....\n3.8\n106.0\n6.5\n10.0\n1982 .....\n3.7\n109.6\n8.4\n6.2\n1983 .....\n5.0\n112.0\n6.8\n4.0\n1984 .....\n8.5\n118.0\n16.9\n4.5\n1985 .....\n22.1\n116.3\n16.1\n3.7\n1986 .....\n22.2\n108.0\n13.5\n2.7\n1987 .....\n9.4\n104.6\n7.8\n3.1\n1988 .....\n4.4\n105.4\n5.5\n3.9\n1989 .....\n3.2\n109.2\n7.7\n4.4\n1990 (Revised)\n4.4\n109.6\n4.8\n4.1\n1991 (Est.)\n3.1\n109.1\n2.9\n3.7\nThe combined ratio represents total insurance costs (losses\nincurred plus expenses) compared to revenue from premiums: A\nratio below 100 indicates an underwriting profit, and one above\n100 indicates a loss. The higher the ratio, the worse the year.\nWhen the investment income that an insurer earns from holding\npolicyholders' funds (\"the float\") is taken into account, a\ncombined ratio in the 107 - 111 range typically produces an\noverall break-even result, exclusive of earnings on the funds\nprovided by shareholders.\nFor the reasons laid out in previous reports, we expect the\nindustry's incurred losses to grow at close to 10% annually, even\nin periods when general inflation runs considerably lower. (Over\nthe last 25 years, incurred losses have in reality grown at a\nstill faster rate, 11%.) If premium growth meanwhile materially\nlags that 10% rate, underwriting losses will mount.\nHowever, the industry's tendency to under-reserve when\nbusiness turns bad may obscure the picture for a time - and that\ncould well describe the situation last year. Though premiums did\nnot come close to growing 10%, the combined ratio failed to\ndeteriorate as I had expected but instead slightly improved.\nLoss-reserve data for the industry indicate that there is reason\nto be skeptical of that outcome, and it may turn out that 1991's\nratio should have been worse than was reported. In the long run,\nof course, trouble awaits managements that paper over operating\nproblems with accounting maneuvers. Eventually, managements of\nthis kind achieve the same result as the seriously-ill patient\nwho tells his doctor: \"I can't afford the operation, but would\nyou accept a small payment to touch up the x-rays?\"\nBerkshire's insurance business has changed in ways that make\ncombined ratios, our own or the\nindustry's, largely irrelevant\nto our performance. What counts with us is the \"cost of funds\ndeveloped from insurance,\" or in the vernacular, \"the cost of\nfloat.\"\nFloat - which we generate in exceptional amounts - is the\ntotal of loss reserves, loss adjustment expense reserves and\nunearned premium reserves minus agents balances, prepaid\nacquisition costs and deferred charges applicable to assumed\nreinsurance. And the cost of float is measured by our\nunderwriting loss.\nThe table below shows our cost of float since we entered the\nbusiness in 1967.\n(1)\n(2)\nYearend Yield\nUnderwriting\nApproximate\non Long-Term\nLoss\nAverage Float\nCost of Funds\nGovt.

S. Government's cost on newly-issued long-term bonds. We have in\nfact beat the government's rate in 20 of the 25 years we have been\nin the insurance business, often by a wide margin. We have over\nthat time also substantially increased the amount of funds we hold,\nwhich counts as a favorable development but only because the cost\nof funds has been satisfactory. Our float should continue to grow;\nthe challenge will be to garner these funds at a reasonable cost.\nBerkshire continues to be a very large writer - perhaps the\nlargest in the world - of \"super-cat\" insurance, which is coverage\nthat other insurance companies buy to protect themselves against\nmajor catastrophic losses.\nProfits in this business are enormously\nvolatile. As I mentioned last year, $100 million in super-cat\npremiums, which is roughly our annual expectation, could deliver us\nanything from a $100 million profit (in a year with no big\ncatastrophe) to a $200 million loss (in a year in which a couple of\nmajor hurricanes and/or earthquakes come along).\nWe price this business expecting to pay out, over the long\nterm, about 90% of the premiums we receive.\nIn any given year,\nhowever, we are likely to appear either enormously profitable or\nenormously unprofitable.\nThat is true in part because GAAP\naccounting does not allow us to set up reserves in the catastrophe-\nfree years for losses that are certain to be experienced in other\nyears. In effect, a one-year accounting cycle is ill-suited to the\nnature of this business - and that is a reality you should be aware\nof when you assess our annual results.\nLast year there appears to have been, by our definition, one\nsuper-cat, but it will trigger payments from only about 25% of our\npolicies. Therefore, we currently estimate the 1991 underwriting\nprofit from our catastrophe business to have been about $11\nmillion. (You may be surprised to learn the identity of the biggest\ncatastrophe in 1991:\nIt was neither the Oakland fire nor Hurricane\nBob, but rather a September typhoon in Japan that caused the\nindustry an insured loss now estimated at about $4-$5 billion. At\nthe higher figure, the loss from the typhoon would surpass that\nfrom Hurricane Hugo, the previous record-holder.)\nInsurers will always need huge amounts of reinsurance\nprotection for marine and aviation disasters as well as for natural\ncatastrophes. In the 1980's much of this reinsurance was supplied\nby \"innocents\" - that is, by insurers that did not understand the\nrisks of the business - but they have now been financially burned\nbeyond recognition. (Berkshire itself was an innocent all too often\nwhen I was personally running the insurance operation.)\nInsurers,\nthough, like investors, eventually repeat their mistakes. At some\npoint - probably after a few catastrophe-scarce years - innocents\nwill reappear and prices for super-cat policies will plunge to\nsilly levels.\nAs long as apparently-adequate rates prevail, however, we will\nbe a major participant in super-cat coverages.\nIn marketing this\nproduct, we enjoy a significant competitive advantage because of\nour premier financial strength.\nThinking insurers know that when\n\"the big one\" comes, many reinsurers who found it easy to write\npolicies will find it difficult to write checks. (Some reinsurers\ncan say what Jackie Mason does: \"I'm fixed for life - as long as I\ndon't buy anything.\") Berkshire's ability to fulfill all its\ncommitments under conditions of even extreme adversity is\nunquestioned.\nOverall, insurance offers Berkshire its greatest\nopportunities. Mike Goldberg has accomplished wonders with this\noperation since he took charge and it has become a very valuable\nasset, albeit one that can't be appraised with any precision.\nMarketable Common Stocks\nOn the next page we list our common stock holdings having a\nvalue of over $100 million. A small portion of these investments\nbelongs to subsidiaries of which Berkshire owns less than 100%.\n12/31/91\nShares\nCompany\nCost\nMarket\n------\n-------\n----------\n----------\n(000s omitted)\n3,000,000\nCapital Cities/ABC, Inc. ............ $\n517,500\n$1,300,500\n46,700,000\nThe Coca-Cola Company. ..............\n1,023,920\n3,747,675\n2,495,200\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. ....\n77,245\n343,090\n6,850,000\nGEICO Corp. .........................\n45,713\n1,363,150\n24,000,000\nThe Gillette Company ................\n600,000\n1,347,000\n31,247,000\nGuinness PLC ........................\n264,782\n296,755\n1,727,765\nThe Washington Post Company .........\n9,731\n336,050\n5,000,000\nWells Fargo & Company\n289,431\n290,000\nAs usual the list reflects our Rip Van Winkle approach to\ninvesting. Guinness is a new position. But we held the other seven\nstocks a year ago (making allowance for the conversion of our\nGillette position from preferred to common) and in six of those we\nhold an unchanged number of shares. The exception is Federal Home\nLoan Mortgage (\"Freddie Mac\"), in which our shareholdings increased\nslightly. Our stay-put behavior reflects our view that the stock\nmarket serves as a relocation center at which money is moved from\nthe active to the patient. (With tongue only partly in check, I\nsuggest that recent events indicate that the much-maligned \"idle\nrich\" have received a bad rap: They have maintained or increased\ntheir wealth while many of the \"energetic rich\" - aggressive real\nestate operators, corporate acquirers, oil drillers, etc. - have\nseen their fortunes disappear.)\nOur Guinness holding represents Berkshire's first significant\ninvestment in a company domiciled outside the United States.\nGuinness, however, earns its money in much the same fashion as\nCoca-Cola and Gillette, U.S.-based companies that garner most of\ntheir profits from international operations. Indeed, in the sense\nof where they earn their profits - continent-by-continent - Coca-\nCola and Guinness display strong similarities. (But you'll never\nget their drinks confused - and your Chairman remains unmovably in\nthe Cherry Coke camp.)\nWe continually search for large businesses with\nunderstandable, enduring and mouth-watering economics that are run\nby able and shareholder-oriented managements. This focus doesn't\nguarantee results: We both have to buy at a sensible price and get\nbusiness performance from our companies that validates our\nassessment. But this investment approach - searching for the\nsuperstars - offers us our only chance for real success. Charlie\nand I are simply not smart enough, considering the large sums we\nwork with, to get great results by adroitly buying and selling\nportions of far-from-great businesses. Nor do we think many others\ncan achieve long-term investment success by flitting from flower to\nflower. Indeed, we believe that according the name \"investors\" to\ninstitutions that trade actively is like calling someone who\nrepeatedly engages in one-night stands a romantic.\nIf my universe of business possibilities was limited, say, to\nprivate companies in Omaha, I would, first, try to assess the long-\nterm economic characteristics of each business; second, assess the\nquality of the people in charge of running it; and, third, try to\nbuy into a few of the best operations at a sensible price. I\ncertainly would not wish to own an equal part of every business in\ntown. Why, then, should Berkshire take a different tack when\ndealing with the larger universe of public companies? And since\nfinding great businesses and outstanding managers is so difficult,\nwhy should we discard proven products? (I was tempted to say \"the\nreal thing.\") Our motto is: \"If at first you do succeed, quit\ntrying.\"\nJohn Maynard Keynes, whose brilliance as a practicing investor\nmatched his brilliance in thought, wrote a letter to a business\nassociate, F. C. Scott, on August 15, 1934 that says it all: \"As\ntime goes on, I get more and more convinced that the right method\nin investment is to put fairly large sums into enterprises which\none thinks one knows something about and in the management of which\none thoroughly believes.\nIt is a mistake to think that one limits\none's risk by spreading too much between enterprises about which\none knows little and has no reason for special confidence. . . .\nOne's knowledge and experience are definitely limited and there are\nseldom more than two or three enterprises at any given time in\nwhich I personally feel myself entitled to put full confidence.\"\nMistake Du Jour\nIn the 1989 annual report I wrote about \"Mistakes of the First\n25 Years\" and promised you an update in 2015. My experiences in the\nfirst few years of this second \"semester\" indicate that my backlog\nof matters to be discussed will become unmanageable if I stick to\nmy original plan. Therefore, I will occasionally unburden myself in\nthese pages in the hope that public confession may deter further\nbumblings. (Post-mortems prove useful for hospitals and football\nteams; why not for businesses and investors?)\nTypically, our most egregious mistakes fall in the omission,\nrather than the commission, category. That may spare Charlie and me\nsome embarrassment, since you don't see these errors; but their\ninvisibility does not reduce their cost. In this mea culpa, I am\nnot talking about missing out on some company that depends upon an\nesoteric invention (such as Xerox), high-technology (Apple), or\neven brilliant merchandising (Wal-Mart). We will never develop the\ncompetence to spot such businesses early. Instead I refer to\nbusiness situations that Charlie and I can understand and that seem\nclearly attractive - but in which we nevertheless end up sucking\nour thumbs rather than buying.\nEvery writer knows it helps to use striking examples, but I\nwish the one I now present wasn't quite so dramatic: In early 1988,\nwe decided to buy 30 million shares (adjusted for a subsequent\nsplit) of Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), which\nwould have been a $350-$400 million investment. We had owned the\nstock some years earlier and understood the company's business.\nFurthermore, it was clear to us that David Maxwell, Fannie Mae's\nCEO, had dealt superbly with some problems that he had inherited\nand had established the company as a financial powerhouse - with\nthe best yet to come. I visited David in Washington and confirmed\nthat he would not be uncomfortable if we were to take a large\nposition.\nAfter we bought about 7 million shares, the price began to\nclimb. In frustration, I stopped buying (a mistake that,\nthankfully, I did not repeat when Coca-Cola stock rose similarly\nduring our purchase program).\nIn an even sillier move, I\nsurrendered to my distaste for holding small positions and sold the\n7 million shares we owned.\nI wish I could give you a halfway rational explanation for my\namateurish behavior vis-a-vis Fannie Mae.\nBut there isn't one.\nWhat I can give you is an estimate as of yearend 1991 of the\napproximate gain that Berkshire didn't make because of your\nChairman's mistake: about $1.4 billion.\nFixed-Income Securities\nWe made several significant changes in our fixed-income\nportfolio during 1991. As I noted earlier, our Gillette preferred\nwas called for redemption, which forced us to convert to common\nstock; we eliminated our holdings of an RJR Nabisco issue that was\nsubject to an exchange offer and subsequent call; and we purchased\nfixed-income securities of American Express and First Empire State\nCorp., a Buffalo-based bank holding company. We also added to a\nsmall position in ACF Industries that we had established in late\n1990.\nOur largest holdings at yearend were:\n(000s omitted)\n---------------------------------------\nCost of Preferreds and\nIssuer\nAmortized Value of Bonds\nMarket\n------\n------------------------\n------------\nACF Industries ................\n$ 93,918(2)\n$118,683\nAmerican Express ..............\n300,000\n263,265(1)(2)\nChampion International ........\n300,000(2)\n300,000(1)\nFirst Empire State\n40,000\n50,000(1)(2)\nRJR Nabisco\n222,148(2)\n285,683\nSalomon\n700,000(2)\n714,000(1)\nUSAir\n358,000(2)\n232,700(1)\nWashington Public Power Systems\n158,553(2)\n203,071\n(1) Fair value as determined by Charlie and me\n(2) Carrying value in our financial statements\nOur $40 million of First Empire State preferred carries a 9%\ncoupon, is non-callable until 1996 and is convertible at $78.91 per\nshare. Normally I would think a purchase of this size too small for\nBerkshire, but I have enormous respect for Bob Wilmers, CEO of\nFirst Empire, and like being his partner on any scale.\nOur American Express preferred is not a normal fixed-income\nsecurity. Rather it is a \"Perc,\" which carries a fixed dividend of\n8.85% on our $300 million cost. Absent one exception mentioned\nlater, our preferred must be converted three years after issuance,\ninto a maximum of 12,244,898 shares. If necessary, a downward\nadjustment in the conversion ratio will be made in order to limit\nto $414 million the total value of the common we receive. Though\nthere is thus a ceiling on the value of the common stock that we\nwill receive upon conversion, there is no floor. The terms of the\npreferred, however, include a provision allowing us to extend the\nconversion date by one year if the common stock is below $24.50 on\nthe third anniversary of our purchase.\nOverall, our fixed-income investments have treated us well,\nboth over the long term and recently. We have realized large\ncapital gains from these holdings, including about $152 million in\n1991. Additionally, our after-tax yields have considerably exceeded\nthose earned by most fixed-income portfolios.\nNevertheless, we have had some surprises, none greater than\nthe need for me to involve myself personally and intensely in the\nSalomon situation. As I write this letter, I am also writing a\nletter for inclusion in Salomon's annual report and I refer you to\nthat report for an update on the company. (Write to: Corporate\nSecretary, Salomon Inc, Seven World Trade Center, New York, NY\n10048) Despite the company's travails, Charlie and I believe our\nSalomon preferred stock increased slightly in value during 1991.\nLower interest rates and a higher price for Salomon's common\nproduced this result.\nLast year I told you that our USAir investment \"should work\nout all right unless the industry is decimated during the next few\nyears.\" Unfortunately 1991 was a decimating period for the\nindustry, as Midway, Pan Am and America West all entered\nbankruptcy. (Stretch the period to 14 months and you can add\nContinental and TWA.)\nThe low valuation that we have given USAir in our table\nreflects the risk that the industry will remain unprofitable for\nvirtually all participants in it, a risk that is far from\nnegligible. The risk is heightened by the fact that the courts have\nbeen encouraging bankrupt carriers to continue operating. These\ncarriers can temporarily charge fares that are below the industry's\ncosts because the bankrupts don't incur the capital costs faced by\ntheir solvent brethren and because they can fund their losses - and\nthereby stave off shutdown - by selling off assets. This burn-the-\nfurniture-to-provide-firewood approach to fare-setting by bankrupt\ncarriers contributes to the toppling of previously-marginal\ncarriers, creating a domino effect that is perfectly designed to\nbring the industry to its knees.\nSeth Schofield, who became CEO of USAir in 1991, is making\nmajor adjustments in the airline's operations in order to improve\nits chances of being one of the few industry survivors. There is no\ntougher job in corporate America than running an airline: Despite\nthe huge amounts of equity capital that have been injected into it,\nthe industry, in aggregate, has posted a net loss since its birth\nafter Kitty Hawk.\nAirline managers need brains, guts, and\nexperience - and Seth possesses all three of these attributes.\nMiscellaneous\nAbout 97.7% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshire's\n1991 shareholder-designated contributions program. Contributions\nmade through the program were $6.8 million, and 2,630 charities\nwere recipients.\nWe suggest that new shareholders read the description of our\nshareholder-designated contributions program that appears on pages\n48-49. To participate in future programs, you must make sure your\nshares are registered in the name of the actual owner, not in the\nnominee name of a broker, bank or depository.\nShares not so\nregistered on August 31, 1992 will be ineligible for the 1992\nprogram.\nIn addition to the shareholder-designated contributions that\nBerkshire distributes, managers of our operating businesses make\ncontributions, including merchandise, averaging about $1.5 million\nannually.\nThese contributions support local charities, such as The\nUnited Way, and produce roughly commensurate benefits for our\nbusinesses.\nHowever, neither our operating managers nor officers of the\nparent company use Berkshire funds to make contributions to broad\nnational programs or charitable activities of special personal\ninterest to them, except to the extent they do so as shareholders.\nIf your employees, including your CEO, wish to give to their alma\nmaters or other institutions to which they feel a personal\nattachment, we believe they should use their own money, not yours.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThe faithful will notice that, for the first time in some\nyears, Charlie's annual letter to Wesco shareholders is not\nreprinted in this report. Since his letter is relatively barebones\nthis year, Charlie said he saw no point in including it in these\npages; my own recommendation, however, is that you get a copy of\nthe Wesco report. Simply write: Corporate Secretary, Wesco\nFinancial Corporation, 315 East Colorado Boulevard, Pasadena, CA\n91101.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nMalcolm G. Chace, Jr., now 88, has decided not to stand for\nelection as a director this year.\nBut the association of the Chace\nfamily with Berkshire will not end: Malcolm III (Kim), Malcolm's\nson, will be nominated to replace him.\nIn 1931, Malcolm went to work for Berkshire Fine Spinning\nAssociates, which merged with Hathaway Manufacturing Co. in 1955 to\nform our present company. Two years later, Malcolm became Berkshire\nHathaway's Chairman, a position he held as well in early 1965 when\nhe made it possible for Buffett Partnership, Ltd. to buy a key\nblock of Berkshire stock owned by some of his relatives.\nThis\npurchase gave our partnership effective control of the company.\nMalcolm's immediate family meanwhile kept its Berkshire stock and\nfor the last 27 years has had the second-largest holding in the\ncompany, trailing only the Buffett family. Malcolm has been a joy\nto work with and we are delighted that the long-running\nrelationship between the Chace family and Berkshire is continuing\nto a new generation.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThe annual meeting this year will be held at the Orpheum\nTheater in downtown Omaha at 9:30 a.m. on Monday, April 27, 1992.\nAttendance last year grew to a record 1,550, but that still leaves\nplenty of room at the Orpheum.\nWe recommend that you get your hotel reservations early at one\nof these hotels: (1) The Radisson-Redick Tower, a small (88 rooms)\nbut nice hotel across the street from the Orpheum; (2) the much\nlarger Red Lion Hotel, located about a five-minute walk from the\nOrpheum; or (3) the Marriott, located in West Omaha about 100 yards\nfrom Borsheim's and a twenty minute drive from downtown. We will\nhave buses at the Marriott that will leave at 8:30 and 8:45 for the\nmeeting and return after it ends.\nCharlie and I always enjoy the meeting, and we hope you can\nmake it. The quality of our shareholders is reflected in the\nquality of the questions we get: We have never attended an annual\nmeeting anywhere that features such a consistently high level of\nintelligent, owner-related questions.\nAn attachment to our proxy material explains how you can\nobtain the card you will need for admission to the meeting. With\nthe admission card, we will enclose information about parking\nfacilities located near the Orpheum. If you are driving, come a\nlittle early.\nNearby lots fill up quickly and you may have to\nwalk a few blocks.\nAs usual, we will have buses to take you to Nebraska Furniture\nMart and Borsheim's after the meeting and to take you from there to\ndowntown hotels or the airport later. I hope that you will allow\nplenty of time to fully explore the attractions of both stores.\nThose of you arriving early can visit the Furniture Mart any day of\nthe week; it is open from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays and\nfrom noon to 5:30 p.m. on Sundays. While there, stop at the See's\nCandy Cart and find out for yourself why Americans ate 26 million\npounds of See's products last year.\nBorsheim's normally is closed on Sunday, but we will be open\nfor shareholders and their guests from noon to 6 p.m. on Sunday,\nApril 26. Borsheim's will also have a special party the previous\nevening at which shareholders are welcome. (You must, however,\nwrite Mrs. Gladys Kaiser at our office for an invitation.) On\ndisplay that evening will be a 150-year retrospective of the most\nexceptional timepieces made by Patek Philippe, including watches\nonce owned by Queen Victoria, Pope Pius IX, Rudyard Kipling, Madame\nCurie and Albert Einstein. The centerpiece of the exhibition will\nbe a $5 million watch whose design and manufacture required nine\nyears of labor by Patek Philippe craftsmen.\nAlong with the rest of\nthe collection, this watch will be on display at the store on\nSunday - unless Charlie has by then impulsively bought it.\nNicholas Kenner nailed me - again - at last year's meeting,\npointing out that I had said in the 1990 annual report that he was\n11 in May 1990, when actually he was 9. So, asked Nicholas rather\ncaustically: \"If you can't get that straight, how do I know the\nnumbers in the back [the financials] are correct?\" I'm still\nsearching for a snappy response. Nicholas will be at this year's\nmeeting - he spurned my offer of a trip to Disney World on that\nday - so join us to watch a continuation of this lop-sided battle\nof wits.\nWarren E.

    "text": "Chairman's Letter - 1992\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOur per-share book value increased 20.3% during 1992.\nOver\nthe last 28 years (that is, since present management took over)\nbook value has grown from $19 to $7,745, or at a rate of 23.6%\ncompounded annually.\nDuring the year, Berkshire's net worth increased by $1.52\nbillion.\nMore than 98% of this gain came from earnings and\nappreciation of portfolio securities, with the remainder coming\nfrom the issuance of new stock.\nThese shares were issued as a\nresult of our calling our convertible debentures for redemption\non January 4, 1993, and of some holders electing to receive\ncommon shares rather than the cash that was their alternative.\nMost holders of the debentures who converted into common waited\nuntil January to do it, but a few made the move in December and\ntherefore received shares in 1992.\nTo sum up what happened to\nthe $476 million of bonds we had outstanding:\n$25 million were\nconverted into shares before yearend; $46 million were converted\nin January; and $405 million were redeemed for cash.\nThe\nconversions were made at $11,719 per share, so altogether we\nissued 6,106 shares.\nBerkshire now has 1,152,547 shares outstanding.\nThat\ncompares, you will be interested to know, to 1,137,778 shares\noutstanding on October 1, 1964, the beginning of the fiscal year\nduring which Buffett Partnership, Ltd. acquired control of the\ncompany.\nWe have a firm policy about issuing shares of Berkshire,\ndoing so only when we receive as much value as we give.\nEqual\nvalue, however, has not been easy to obtain, since we have always\nvalued our shares highly.\nSo be it:\nWe wish to increase\nBerkshire's size only when doing that also increases the wealth\nof its owners.\nThose two objectives do not necessarily go hand-in-hand as an\namusing but value-destroying experience in our past illustrates.\nOn that occasion, we had a significant investment in a bank\nwhose management was hell-bent on expansion.\n(Aren't they all?)\nWhen our bank wooed a smaller bank, its owner demanded a stock\nswap on a basis that valued the acquiree's net worth and earning\npower at over twice that of the acquirer's.\nOur management -\nvisibly in heat - quickly capitulated.\nThe owner of the acquiree\nthen insisted on one other condition:\n\"You must promise me,\" he\nsaid in effect, \"that once our merger is done and I have become a\nmajor shareholder, you'll never again make a deal this dumb.\"\nYou will remember that our goal is to increase our per-share\nintrinsic value - for which our book value is a conservative, but\nuseful, proxy - at a 15% annual rate.\nThis objective, however,\ncannot be attained in a smooth manner.\nSmoothness is\nparticularly elusive because of the accounting rules that apply\nto the common stocks owned by our insurance companies, whose\nportfolios represent a high proportion of Berkshire's net worth.\nSince 1979, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) have\nrequired that these securities be valued at their market prices\n(less an adjustment for tax on any net unrealized appreciation)\nrather than at the lower of cost or market.\nRun-of-the-mill\nfluctuations in equity prices therefore cause our annual results\nto gyrate, especially in comparison to those of the typical\nindustrial company.\nTo illustrate just how volatile our progress has been - and\nto indicate the impact that market movements have on short-term\nresults - we show on the facing page our annual change in per-\nshare net worth and compare it with the annual results (including\ndividends) of the S&P 500.\nYou should keep at least three points in mind as you\nevaluate this data.\nThe first point concerns the many businesses\nwe operate whose annual earnings are unaffected by changes in\nstock market valuations.\nThe impact of these businesses on both\nour absolute and relative performance has changed over the years.\nEarly on, returns from our textile operation, which then\nrepresented a significant portion of our net worth, were a major\ndrag on performance, averaging far less than would have been the\ncase if the money invested in that business had instead been\ninvested in the S&P 500.\nIn more recent years, as we assembled\nour collection of exceptional businesses run by equally\nexceptional managers, the returns from our operating businesses\nhave been high - usually well in excess of the returns achieved\nby the S&P.\nA second important factor to consider - and one that\nsignificantly hurts our relative performance - is that both the\nincome and capital gains from our securities are burdened by a\nsubstantial corporate tax liability whereas the S&P returns are\npre-tax.\nTo comprehend the damage, imagine that Berkshire had\nowned nothing other than the S&P index during the 28-year period\ncovered. In that case, the tax bite would have caused our\ncorporate performance to be appreciably below the record shown in\nthe table for the S&P.\nUnder present tax laws, a gain for the\nS&P of 18% delivers a corporate holder of that index a return\nwell short of 13%.\nAnd this problem would be intensified if\ncorporate tax rates were to rise.\nThis is a structural\ndisadvantage we simply have to live with; there is no antidote\nfor it.\nThe third point incorporates two predictions:\nCharlie\nMunger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman and my partner, and I are\nvirtually certain that the return over the next decade from an\ninvestment in the S&P index will be far less than that of the\npast decade, and we are dead certain that the drag exerted by\nBerkshire's expanding capital base will substantially reduce our\nhistorical advantage relative to the index.\nMaking the first prediction goes somewhat against our grain:\nWe've long felt that the only value of stock forecasters is to\nmake fortune tellers look good.\nEven now, Charlie and I continue\nto believe that short-term market forecasts are poison and should\nbe kept locked up in a safe place, away from children and also\nfrom grown-ups who behave in the market like children.\nHowever,\nit is clear that stocks cannot forever overperform their\nunderlying businesses, as they have so dramatically done for some\ntime, and that fact makes us quite confident of our forecast that\nthe rewards from investing in stocks over the next decade will be\nsignificantly smaller than they were in the last.\nOur second\nconclusion - that an increased capital base will act as an anchor\non our relative performance - seems incontestable.\nThe only open\nquestion is whether we can drag the anchor along at some\ntolerable, though slowed, pace.\nWe will continue to experience considerable volatility in\nour annual results.\nThat's assured by the general volatility of\nthe stock market, by the concentration of our equity holdings in\njust a few companies, and by certain business decisions we have\nmade, most especially our move to commit large resources to\nsuper-catastrophe insurance.\nWe not only accept this volatility\nbut welcome it:\nA tolerance for short-term swings improves our\nlong-term prospects.\nIn baseball lingo, our performance\nyardstick is slugging percentage, not batting average.\nThe Salomon Interlude\nLast June, I stepped down as Interim Chairman of Salomon Inc\nafter ten months in the job.\nYou can tell from Berkshire's 1991-\n92 results that the company didn't miss me while I was gone.\nBut\nthe reverse isn't true:\nI missed Berkshire and am delighted to\nbe back full-time.\nThere is no job in the world that is more fun\nthan running Berkshire and I count myself lucky to be where I am.\nThe Salomon post, though far from fun, was interesting and\nworthwhile:\nIn Fortune's annual survey of America's Most Admired\nCorporations, conducted last September, Salomon ranked second\namong 311 companies in the degree to which it improved its\nreputation.\nAdditionally, Salomon Brothers, the securities\nsubsidiary of Salomon Inc, reported record pre-tax earnings last\nyear - 34% above the previous high.\nMany people helped in the resolution of Salomon's problems\nand the righting of the firm, but a few clearly deserve special\nmention.\nIt is no exaggeration to say that without the combined\nefforts of Salomon executives Deryck Maughan, Bob Denham, Don\nHoward, and John Macfarlane, the firm very probably would not\nhave survived.\nIn their work, these men were tireless,\neffective, supportive and selfless, and I will forever be\ngrateful to them.\nSalomon's lead lawyer in its Government matters, Ron Olson\nof Munger, Tolles & Olson, was also key to our success in getting\nthrough this trouble.\nThe firm's problems were not only severe,\nbut complex.\nAt least five authorities - the SEC, the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York, the U.S. Treasury, the U.S. Attorney\nfor the Southern District of New York, and the Antitrust Division\nof the Department of Justice - had important concerns about\nSalomon.\nIf we were to resolve our problems in a coordinated and\nprompt manner, we needed a lawyer with exceptional legal,\nbusiness and human skills.\nRon had them all.\nAcquisitions\nOf all our activities at Berkshire, the most exhilarating\nfor Charlie and me is the acquisition of a business with\nexcellent economic characteristics and a management that we like,\ntrust and admire.\nSuch acquisitions are not easy to make but we\nlook for them constantly.\nIn the search, we adopt the same\nattitude one might find appropriate in looking for a spouse:\nIt\npays to be active, interested and open-minded, but it does not\npay to be in a hurry.\nIn the past, I've observed that many acquisition-hungry\nmanagers were apparently mesmerized by their childhood reading of\nthe story about the frog-kissing princess.\nRemembering her\nsuccess, they pay dearly for the right to kiss corporate toads,\nexpecting wondrous transfigurations.\nInitially, disappointing\nresults only deepen their desire to round up new toads.\n(\"Fanaticism,\" said Santyana, \"consists of redoubling your effort\nwhen you've forgotten your aim.\")\nUltimately, even the most\noptimistic manager must face reality.\nStanding knee-deep in\nunresponsive toads, he then announces an enormous \"restructuring\"\ncharge.\nIn this corporate equivalent of a Head Start program,\nthe CEO receives the education but the stockholders pay the\ntuition.\nIn my early days as a manager I, too, dated a few toads.\nThey were cheap dates - I've never been much of a sport - but my\nresults matched those of acquirers who courted higher-priced\ntoads.\nI kissed and they croaked.\nAfter several failures of this type, I finally remembered\nsome useful advice I once got from a golf pro (who, like all pros\nwho have had anything to do with my game, wishes to remain\nanonymous).\nSaid the pro:\n\"Practice doesn't make perfect;\npractice makes permanent.\"\nAnd thereafter I revised my strategy\nand tried to buy good businesses at fair prices rather than fair\nbusinesses at good prices.\nLast year, in December, we made an acquisition that is a\nprototype of what we now look for.\nThe purchase was 82% of\nCentral States Indemnity, an insurer that makes monthly payments\nfor credit-card holders who are unable themselves to pay because\nthey have become disabled or unemployed.\nCurrently the company's\nannual premiums are about $90 million and profits about $10\nmillion.\nCentral States is based in Omaha and managed by Bill\nKizer, a friend of mine for over 35 years.\nThe Kizer family -\nwhich includes sons Bill, Dick and John - retains 18% ownership\nof the business and will continue to run things just as it has in\nthe past.\nWe could not be associated with better people.\nCoincidentally, this latest acquisition has much in common\nwith our first, made 26 years ago.\nAt that time, we purchased\nanother Omaha insurer, National Indemnity Company (along with a\nsmall sister company) from Jack Ringwalt, another long-time\nfriend.\nJack had built the business from scratch and, as was the\ncase with Bill Kizer, thought of me when he wished to sell.\n(Jack's comment at the time:\n\"If I don't sell the company, my\nexecutor will, and I'd rather pick the home for it.\")\nNational\nIndemnity was an outstanding business when we bought it and\ncontinued to be under Jack's management.\nHollywood has had good\nluck with sequels; I believe we, too, will.\nBerkshire's acquisition criteria are described on page 23.\nBeyond purchases made by the parent company, however, our\nsubsidiaries sometimes make small \"add-on\" acquisitions that\nextend their product lines or distribution capabilities.\nIn this\nmanner, we enlarge the domain of managers we already know to be\noutstanding - and that's a low-risk and high-return proposition.\nWe made five acquisitions of this type in 1992, and one was not\nso small:\nAt yearend, H. H. Brown purchased Lowell Shoe Company,\na business with $90 million in sales that makes Nursemates, a\nleading line of shoes for nurses, and other kinds of shoes as\nwell.\nOur operating managers will continue to look for add-on\nopportunities, and we would expect these to contribute modestly\nto Berkshire's value in the future.\nThen again, a trend has emerged that may make further\nacquisitions difficult.\nThe parent company made one purchase in\n1991, buying H. H. Brown, which is run by Frank Rooney, who has\neight children.\nIn 1992 our only deal was with Bill Kizer,\nfather of nine.\nIt won't be easy to keep this string going in\n1993.\nSources of Reported Earnings\nThe table below shows the major sources of Berkshire's\nreported earnings.\nIn this presentation, amortization of\nGoodwill and other major purchase-price accounting adjustments\nare not charged against the specific businesses to which they\napply, but are instead aggregated and shown separately.\nThis\nprocedure lets you view the earnings of our businesses as they\nwould have been reported had we not purchased them.\nI've\nexplained in past reports why this form of presentation seems to\nus to be more useful to investors and managers than one utilizing\nGAAP, which requires purchase-price adjustments to be made on a\nbusiness-by-business basis.\nThe total net earnings we show in\nthe table are, of course, identical to the GAAP total in our\naudited financial statements.\n(000s omitted)\n-----------------------------------------------\nBerkshire's Share\nof Net Earnings\n(after taxes and\nPre-Tax Earnings\nminority interests)\n----------------------\n----------------------\n1992\n1991\n1992\n1991\n----------\n----------\n----------\n----------\nOperating Earnings:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting ............ $(108,961)\n$(119,593)\n$ (71,141)\n$ (77,229)\nNet Investment Income....\n355,067\n331,846\n305,763\n285,173\nH.

reported on a GAAP basis.\nOur goal is to give you\nall of the financial information that Charlie and I consider\nsignificant in making our own evaluation of Berkshire.\n\"Look-Through\" Earnings\nWe've previously discussed look-through earnings, which\nconsist of: (1) the operating earnings reported in the previous\nsection, plus; (2) the retained operating earnings of major\ninvestees that, under GAAP accounting, are not reflected in our\nprofits, less; (3) an allowance for the tax that would be paid by\nBerkshire if these retained earnings of investees had instead been\ndistributed to us.\nThough no single figure can be perfect, we\nbelieve that the look-through number more accurately portrays the\nearnings of Berkshire than does the GAAP number.\nI've told you that over time look-through earnings must\nincrease at about 15% annually if our intrinsic business value is\nto grow at that rate.\nOur look-through earnings in 1992 were $604\nmillion, and they will need to grow to more than $1.8 billion by\nthe year 2000 if we are to meet that 15% goal.\nFor us to get\nthere, our operating subsidiaries and investees must deliver\nexcellent performances, and we must exercise some skill in capital\nallocation as well.\nWe cannot promise to achieve the $1.8 billion target.\nIndeed,\nwe may not even come close to it.\nBut it does guide our decision-\nmaking:\nWhen we allocate capital today, we are thinking about what\nwill maximize look-through earnings in 2000.\nWe do not, however, see this long-term focus as eliminating\nthe need for us to achieve decent short-term results as well.\nAfter all, we were thinking long-range thoughts five or ten years\nago, and the moves we made then should now be paying off.\nIf\nplantings made confidently are repeatedly followed by disappointing\nharvests, something is wrong with the farmer.\n(Or perhaps with the\nfarm:\nInvestors should understand that for certain companies, and\neven for some industries, there simply is no good long-term\nstrategy.)\nJust as you should be suspicious of managers who pump\nup short-term earnings by accounting maneuvers, asset sales and the\nlike, so also should you be suspicious of those managers who fail\nto deliver for extended periods and blame it on their long-term\nfocus.\n(Even Alice, after listening to the Queen lecture her about\n\"jam tomorrow,\" finally insisted, \"It must come sometimes to jam\ntoday.\")\nThe following table shows you how we calculate look-through\nearnings, though I warn you that the figures are necessarily very\nrough.\n(The dividends paid to us by these investees have been\nincluded in the operating earnings itemized on page 8, mostly\nunder \"Insurance Group:\nNet Investment Income.\")\nBerkshire's

.................\n2.4\n108.8\n1992 (Est.) ....................\n2.7\n114.8\nThe combined ratio represents total insurance costs (losses\nincurred plus expenses) compared to revenue from premiums:\nA\nratio below 100 indicates an underwriting profit, and one above\n100 indicates a loss.\nThe higher the ratio, the worse the year.\nWhen the investment income that an insurer earns from holding\npolicyholders' funds (\"the float\") is taken into account, a\ncombined ratio in the 106 - 110 range typically produces an\noverall break-even result, exclusive of earnings on the funds\nprovided by shareholders.\nAbout four points in the industry's 1992 combined ratio can\nbe attributed to Hurricane Andrew, which caused the largest\ninsured loss in history.\nAndrew destroyed a few small insurers.\nBeyond that, it awakened some larger companies to the fact that\ntheir reinsurance protection against catastrophes was far from\nadequate.\n(It's only when the tide goes out that you learn who's\nbeen swimming naked.)\nOne major insurer escaped insolvency\nsolely because it had a wealthy parent that could promptly supply\na massive transfusion of capital.\nBad as it was, however, Andrew could easily have been far\nmore damaging if it had hit Florida 20 or 30 miles north of where\nit actually did and had hit Louisiana further east than was the\ncase.\nAll in all, many companies will rethink their reinsurance\nprograms in light of the Andrew experience.\nAs you know we are a large writer - perhaps the largest in\nthe world - of \"super-cat\" coverages, which are the policies that\nother insurance companies buy to protect themselves against major\ncatastrophic losses.\nConsequently, we too took our lumps from\nAndrew, suffering losses from it of about $125 million, an amount\nroughly equal to our 1992 super-cat premium income.\nOur other\nsuper-cat losses, though, were negligible.\nThis line of business\ntherefore produced an overall loss of only $2 million for the\nyear.\n(In addition, our investee, GEICO, suffered a net loss\nfrom Andrew, after reinsurance recoveries and tax savings, of\nabout $50 million, of which our share is roughly $25 million.\nThis loss did not affect our operating earnings, but did reduce\nour look-through earnings.)\nIn last year's report I told you that I hoped that our\nsuper-cat business would over time achieve a 10% profit margin.\nBut I also warned you that in any given year the line was likely\nto be \"either enormously profitable or enormously unprofitable.\"\nInstead, both 1991 and 1992 have come in close to a break-even\nlevel.\nNonetheless, I see these results as aberrations and stick\nwith my prediction of huge annual swings in profitability from\nthis business.\nLet me remind you of some characteristics of our super-cat\npolicies.\nGenerally, they are activated only when two things\nhappen.\nFirst, the direct insurer or reinsurer we protect must\nsuffer losses of a given amount - that's the policyholder's\n\"retention\" - from a catastrophe; and second, industry-wide\ninsured losses from the catastrophe must exceed some minimum\nlevel, which usually is $3 billion or more.\nIn most cases, the\npolicies we issue cover only a specific geographical area, such\nas a portion of the U.S., the entire U.S., or everywhere other\nthan the U.S.\nAlso, many policies are not activated by the first\nsuper-cat that meets the policy terms, but instead cover only a\n\"second-event\" or even a third- or fourth-event.\nFinally, some\npolicies are triggered only by a catastrophe of a specific type,\nsuch as an earthquake.\nOur exposures are large: We have one\npolicy that calls for us to pay $100 million to the policyholder\nif a specified catastrophe occurs.\n(Now you know why I suffer\neyestrain:\nfrom watching The Weather Channel.)\nCurrently, Berkshire is second in the U.S. property-casualty\nindustry in net worth (the leader being State Farm, which neither\nbuys nor sells reinsurance).\nTherefore, we have the capacity to\nassume risk on a scale that interests virtually no other company.\nWe have the appetite as well:\nAs Berkshire's net worth and\nearnings grow, our willingness to write business increases also.\nBut let me add that means good business.\nThe saying, \"a fool\nand his money are soon invited everywhere,\" applies in spades in\nreinsurance, and we actually reject more than 98% of the business\nwe are offered.\nOur ability to choose between good and bad\nproposals reflects a management strength that matches our\nfinancial strength:\nAjit Jain, who runs our reinsurance\noperation, is simply the best in this business.\nIn combination,\nthese strengths guarantee that we will stay a major factor in the\nsuper-cat business so long as prices are appropriate.\nWhat constitutes an appropriate price, of course, is\ndifficult to determine.\nCatastrophe insurers can't simply\nextrapolate past experience.\nIf there is truly \"global warming,\"\nfor example, the odds would shift, since tiny changes in\natmospheric conditions can produce momentous changes in weather\npatterns.\nFurthermore, in recent years there has been a\nmushrooming of population and insured values in U.S. coastal\nareas that are particularly vulnerable to hurricanes, the number\none creator of super-cats.\nA hurricane that caused x dollars of\ndamage 20 years ago could easily cost 10x now.\nOccasionally, also, the unthinkable happens.\nWho would have\nguessed, for example, that a major earthquake could occur in\nCharleston, S.C.? (It struck in 1886, registered an estimated 6.6\non the Richter scale, and caused 60 deaths.)\nAnd who could have\nimagined that our country's most serious quake would occur at New\nMadrid, Missouri, which suffered an estimated 8.7 shocker in\n1812.\nBy comparison, the 1989 San Francisco quake was a 7.1 -\nand remember that each one-point Richter increase represents a\nten-fold increase in strength.\nSomeday, a U.S. earthquake\noccurring far from California will cause enormous losses for\ninsurers.\nWhen viewing our quarterly figures, you should understand\nthat our accounting for super-cat premiums differs from our\naccounting for other insurance premiums.\nRather than recording\nour super-cat premiums on a pro-rata basis over the life of a\ngiven policy, we defer recognition of revenue until a loss occurs\nor until the policy expires.\nWe take this conservative approach\nbecause the likelihood of super-cats causing us losses is\nparticularly great toward the end of the year.\nIt is then that\nweather tends to kick up:\nOf the ten largest insured losses in\nU.S. history, nine occurred in the last half of the year.\nIn\naddition, policies that are not triggered by a first event are\nunlikely, by their very terms, to cause us losses until late in\nthe year.\nThe bottom-line effect of our accounting procedure for\nsuper-cats is this:\nLarge losses may be reported in any quarter\nof the year, but significant profits will only be reported in the\nfourth quarter.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAs I've told you in each of the last few years, what counts\nin our insurance business is \"the cost of funds developed from\ninsurance,\" or in the vernacular, \"the cost of float.\"\nFloat -\nwhich we generate in exceptional amounts - is the total of loss\nreserves, loss adjustment expense reserves and unearned premium\nreserves minus agents' balances, prepaid acquisition costs and\ndeferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance.\nThe cost of\nfloat is measured by our underwriting loss.\nThe table below shows our cost of float since we entered the\nbusiness in 1967.\n(1)\n(2)\nYearend Yield\nUnderwriting\nApproximate\non Long-Term\nLoss\nAverage Float\nCost of Funds\nGovt.

in certain sectors we can compete world-wide;\nand Berkshire possesses an important competitive advantage.\nWe\nwill look for ways to expand our participation in the business,\neither indirectly as we have done through GEICO or directly as we\ndid by acquiring Central States Indemnity.\nCommon Stock Investments\nBelow we list our common stock holdings having a value of over\n$100 million.\nA small portion of these investments belongs to\nsubsidiaries of which Berkshire owns less than 100%.\n12/31/92\nShares\nCompany\nCost\nMarket\n------\n-------\n----------\n----------\n(000s omitted)\n3,000,000\nCapital Cities/ABC, Inc. ............. $\n517,500\n$1,523,500\n93,400,000\nThe Coca-Cola Company. ...............\n1,023,920\n3,911,125\n16,196,700\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.\n(\"Freddie Mac\") ...................\n414,257\n783,515\n34,250,000\nGEICO Corp. ..........................\n45,713\n2,226,250\n4,350,000\nGeneral Dynamics Corp. ...............\n312,438\n450,769\n24,000,000\nThe Gillette Company .................\n600,000\n1,365,000\n38,335,000\nGuinness PLC .........................\n333,019\n299,581\n1,727,765\nThe Washington Post Company ..........\n9,731\n396,954\n6,358,418\nWells Fargo & Company ................\n380,983\n485,624\nLeaving aside splits, the number of shares we held in these\ncompanies changed during 1992 in only four cases:\nWe added\nmoderately to our holdings in Guinness and Wells Fargo, we more\nthan doubled our position in Freddie Mac, and we established a new\nholding in General Dynamics.\nWe like to buy.\nSelling, however, is a different story.\nThere, our pace of\nactivity resembles that forced upon a traveler who found himself\nstuck in tiny Podunk's only hotel.\nWith no T.V. in his room, he\nfaced an evening of boredom.\nBut his spirits soared when he spied\na book on the night table entitled \"Things to do in Podunk.\"\nOpening it, he found just a single sentence: \"You're doing it.\"\nWe were lucky in our General Dynamics purchase.\nI had paid\nlittle attention to the company until last summer, when it\nannounced it would repurchase about 30% of its shares by way of a\nDutch tender.\nSeeing an arbitrage opportunity, I began buying the\nstock for Berkshire, expecting to tender our holdings for a small\nprofit.\nWe've made the same sort of commitment perhaps a half-\ndozen times in the last few years, reaping decent rates of return\nfor the short periods our money has been tied up.\nBut then I began studying the company and the accomplishments\nof Bill Anders in the brief time he'd been CEO.\nAnd what I saw\nmade my eyes pop:\nBill had a clearly articulated and rational\nstrategy; he had been focused and imbued with a sense of urgency in\ncarrying it out; and the results were truly remarkable.\nIn short order, I dumped my arbitrage thoughts and decided\nthat Berkshire should become a long-term investor with Bill.\nWe\nwere helped in gaining a large position by the fact that a tender\ngreatly swells the volume of trading in a stock.\nIn a one-month\nperiod, we were able to purchase 14% of the General Dynamics shares\nthat remained outstanding after the tender was completed.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nOur equity-investing strategy remains little changed from what\nit was fifteen years ago, when we said in the 1977 annual report:\n\"We select our marketable equity securities in much the way we\nwould evaluate a business for acquisition in its entirety.\nWe want\nthe business to be one (a) that we can understand; (b) with\nfavorable long-term prospects; (c) operated by honest and competent\npeople; and (d) available at a very attractive price.\"\nWe have\nseen cause to make only one change in this creed: Because of both\nmarket conditions and our size, we now substitute \"an attractive\nprice\" for \"a very attractive price.\"\nBut how, you will ask, does one decide what's \"attractive\"?\nIn answering this question, most analysts feel they must choose\nbetween two approaches customarily thought to be in opposition:\n\"value\" and \"growth.\"\nIndeed, many investment professionals see\nany mixing of the two terms as a form of intellectual cross-\ndressing.\nWe view that as fuzzy thinking (in which, it must be\nconfessed, I myself engaged some years ago).\nIn our opinion, the\ntwo approaches are joined at the hip:\nGrowth is always a component\nin the calculation of value, constituting a variable whose\nimportance can range from negligible to enormous and whose impact\ncan be negative as well as positive.\nIn addition, we think the very term \"value investing\" is\nredundant.\nWhat is \"investing\" if it is not the act of seeking\nvalue at least sufficient to justify the amount paid?\nConsciously\npaying more for a stock than its calculated value - in the hope\nthat it can soon be sold for a still-higher price - should be\nlabeled speculation (which is neither illegal, immoral nor - in our\nview - financially fattening).\nWhether appropriate or not, the term \"value investing\" is\nwidely used.\nTypically, it connotes the purchase of stocks having\nattributes such as a low ratio of price to book value, a low price-\nearnings ratio, or a high dividend yield.\nUnfortunately, such\ncharacteristics, even if they appear in combination, are far from\ndeterminative as to whether an investor is indeed buying something\nfor what it is worth and is therefore truly operating on the\nprinciple of obtaining value in his investments.\nCorrespondingly,\nopposite characteristics - a high ratio of price to book value, a\nhigh price-earnings ratio, and a low dividend yield - are in no way\ninconsistent with a \"value\" purchase.\nSimilarly, business growth, per se, tells us little about\nvalue.\nIt's true that growth often has a positive impact on value,\nsometimes one of spectacular proportions.\nBut such an effect is\nfar from certain.\nFor example, investors have regularly poured\nmoney into the domestic airline business to finance profitless (or\nworse) growth.\nFor these investors, it would have been far better\nif Orville had failed to get off the ground at Kitty Hawk: The more\nthe industry has grown, the worse the disaster for owners.\nGrowth benefits investors only when the business in point can\ninvest at incremental returns that are enticing - in other words,\nonly when each dollar used to finance the growth creates over a\ndollar of long-term market value.\nIn the case of a low-return\nbusiness requiring incremental funds, growth hurts the investor.\nIn The Theory of Investment Value, written over 50 years ago,\nJohn Burr Williams set forth the equation for value, which we\ncondense here:\nThe value of any stock, bond or business today is\ndetermined by the cash inflows and outflows - discounted at an\nappropriate interest rate - that can be expected to occur during\nthe remaining life of the asset.\nNote that the formula is the same\nfor stocks as for bonds.\nEven so, there is an important, and\ndifficult to deal with, difference between the two:\nA bond has a\ncoupon and maturity date that define future cash flows; but in the\ncase of equities, the investment analyst must himself estimate the\nfuture \"coupons.\"\nFurthermore, the quality of management affects\nthe bond coupon only rarely - chiefly when management is so inept\nor dishonest that payment of interest is suspended.\nIn contrast,\nthe ability of management can dramatically affect the equity\n\"coupons.\"\nThe investment shown by the discounted-flows-of-cash\ncalculation to be the cheapest is the one that the investor should\npurchase - irrespective of whether the business grows or doesn't,\ndisplays volatility or smoothness in its earnings, or carries a\nhigh price or low in relation to its current earnings and book\nvalue.\nMoreover, though the value equation has usually shown\nequities to be cheaper than bonds, that result is not inevitable:\nWhen bonds are calculated to be the more attractive investment,\nthey should be bought.\nLeaving the question of price aside, the best business to own\nis one that over an extended period can employ large amounts of\nincremental capital at very high rates of return.\nThe worst\nbusiness to own is one that must, or will, do the opposite - that\nis, consistently employ ever-greater amounts of capital at very low\nrates of return.\nUnfortunately, the first type of business is very\nhard to find:\nMost high-return businesses need relatively little\ncapital.\nShareholders of such a business usually will benefit if\nit pays out most of its earnings in dividends or makes significant\nstock repurchases.\nThough the mathematical calculations required to evaluate\nequities are not difficult, an analyst - even one who is\nexperienced and intelligent - can easily go wrong in estimating\nfuture \"coupons.\"\nAt Berkshire, we attempt to deal with this\nproblem in two ways.\nFirst, we try to stick to businesses we\nbelieve we understand.\nThat means they must be relatively simple\nand stable in character.\nIf a business is complex or subject to\nconstant change, we're not smart enough to predict future cash\nflows.\nIncidentally, that shortcoming doesn't bother us.\nWhat\ncounts for most people in investing is not how much they know, but\nrather how realistically they define what they don't know.\nAn\ninvestor needs to do very few things right as long as he or she\navoids big mistakes.\nSecond, and equally important, we insist on a margin of safety\nin our purchase price.\nIf we calculate the value of a common stock\nto be only slightly higher than its price, we're not interested in\nbuying.\nWe believe this margin-of-safety principle, so strongly\nemphasized by Ben Graham, to be the cornerstone of investment\nsuccess.\nFixed-Income Securities\nBelow we list our largest holdings of fixed-income securities:\n(000s omitted)\n------------------------------------\nCost of Preferreds and\nIssuer\nAmortized Value of Bonds\nMarket\n------\n------------------------\n----------\nACF Industries Debentures ......\n$133,065(1)\n$163,327\nAmerican Express \"Percs\" .......\n300,000\n309,000(1)(2)\nChampion International Conv.

and eventual prosperity - by accepting British Airways'\noffer to make a substantial, but minority, investment in the\ncompany.\nIn connection with this transaction, Charlie and I were\nasked to join the USAir board.\nWe agreed, though this makes five\noutside board memberships for me, which is more than I believe\nadvisable for an active CEO.\nEven so, if an investee's management\nand directors believe it particularly important that Charlie and I\njoin its board, we are glad to do so.\nWe expect the managers of\nour investees to work hard to increase the value of the businesses\nthey run, and there are times when large owners should do their bit\nas well.\nTwo New Accounting Rules and a Plea for One More\nA new accounting rule having to do with deferred taxes becomes\neffective in 1993.\nIt undoes a dichotomy in our books that I have\ndescribed in previous annual reports and that relates to the\naccrued taxes carried against the unrealized appreciation in our\ninvestment portfolio.\nAt yearend 1992, that appreciation amounted\nto $7.6 billion.\nAgainst $6.4 billion of that, we carried taxes at\nthe current 34% rate.\nAgainst the remainder of $1.2 billion, we\ncarried an accrual of 28%, the tax rate in effect when that portion\nof the appreciation occurred.\nThe new accounting rule says we must\nhenceforth accrue all deferred tax at the current rate, which to us\nseems sensible.\nThe new marching orders mean that in the first quarter of 1993\nwe will apply a 34% rate to all of our unrealized appreciation,\nthereby increasing the tax liability and reducing net worth by $70\nmillion.\nThe new rule also will cause us to make other minor\nchanges in our calculation of deferred taxes.\nFuture changes in tax rates will be reflected immediately in\nthe liability for deferred taxes and, correspondingly, in net\nworth.\nThe impact could well be substantial.\nNevertheless, what\nis important in the end is the tax rate at the time we sell\nsecurities, when unrealized appreciation becomes realized.\nAnother major accounting change, whose implementation is\nrequired by January 1, 1993, mandates that businesses recognize\ntheir present-value liability for post-retirement health benefits.\nThough GAAP has previously required recognition of pensions to be\npaid in the future, it has illogically ignored the costs that\ncompanies will then have to bear for health benefits.\nThe new rule\nwill force many companies to record a huge balance-sheet liability\n(and a consequent reduction in net worth) and also henceforth to\nrecognize substantially higher costs when they are calculating\nannual profits.\nIn making acquisitions, Charlie and I have tended to avoid\ncompanies with significant post-retirement liabilities.\nAs a\nresult, Berkshire's present liability and future costs for post-\nretirement health benefits - though we now have 22,000 employees -\nare inconsequential.\nI need to admit, though, that we had a near\nmiss:\nIn 1982 I made a huge mistake in committing to buy a company\nburdened by extraordinary post-retirement health obligations.\nLuckily, though, the transaction fell through for reasons beyond\nour control.\nReporting on this episode in the 1982 annual report,\nI said:\n\"If we were to introduce graphics to this report,\nillustrating favorable business developments of the past year, two\nblank pages depicting this blown deal would be the appropriate\ncenterfold.\"\nEven so, I wasn't expecting things to get as bad as\nthey did.\nAnother buyer appeared, the business soon went bankrupt\nand was shut down, and thousands of workers found those bountiful\nhealth-care promises to be largely worthless.\nIn recent decades, no CEO would have dreamed of going to his\nboard with the proposition that his company become an insurer of\nuncapped post-retirement health benefits that other corporations\nchose to install.\nA CEO didn't need to be a medical expert to know\nthat lengthening life expectancies and soaring health costs would\nguarantee an insurer a financial battering from such a business.\nNevertheless, many a manager blithely committed his own company to\na self-insurance plan embodying precisely the same promises - and\nthereby doomed his shareholders to suffer the inevitable\nconsequences.\nIn health-care, open-ended promises have created\nopen-ended liabilities that in a few cases loom so large as to\nthreaten the global competitiveness of major American industries.\nI believe part of the reason for this reckless behavior was\nthat accounting rules did not, for so long, require the booking of\npost-retirement health costs as they were incurred.\nInstead, the\nrules allowed cash-basis accounting, which vastly understated the\nliabilities that were building up.\nIn effect, the attitude of both\nmanagements and their accountants toward these liabilities was\n\"out-of-sight, out-of-mind.\"\nIronically, some of these same\nmanagers would be quick to criticize Congress for employing \"cash-\nbasis\" thinking in respect to Social Security promises or other\nprograms creating future liabilities of size.\nManagers thinking about accounting issues should never forget\none of Abraham Lincoln's favorite riddles:\n\"How many legs does a\ndog have if you call his tail a leg?\"\nThe answer:\n\"Four, because\ncalling a tail a leg does not make it a leg.\"\nIt behooves managers\nto remember that Abe's right even if an auditor is willing to\ncertify that the tail is a leg.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThe most egregious case of let's-not-face-up-to-reality\nbehavior by executives and accountants has occurred in the world of\nstock options.\nIn Berkshire's 1985 annual report, I laid out my\nopinions about the use and misuse of options.\nBut even when\noptions are structured properly, they are accounted for in ways\nthat make no sense.\nThe lack of logic is not accidental:\nFor\ndecades, much of the business world has waged war against\naccounting rulemakers, trying to keep the costs of stock options\nfrom being reflected in the profits of the corporations that issue\nthem.\nTypically, executives have argued that options are hard to\nvalue and that therefore their costs should be ignored.\nAt other\ntimes managers have said that assigning a cost to options would\ninjure small start-up businesses.\nSometimes they have even\nsolemnly declared that \"out-of-the-money\" options (those with an\nexercise price equal to or above the current market price) have no\nvalue when they are issued.\nOddly, the Council of Institutional Investors has chimed in\nwith a variation on that theme, opining that options should not be\nviewed as a cost because they \"aren't dollars out of a company's\ncoffers.\"\nI see this line of reasoning as offering exciting\npossibilities to American corporations for instantly improving\ntheir reported profits.\nFor example, they could eliminate the cost\nof insurance by paying for it with options.\nSo if you're a CEO and\nsubscribe to this \"no cash-no cost\" theory of accounting, I'll make\nyou an offer you can't refuse:\nGive us a call at Berkshire and we\nwill happily sell you insurance in exchange for a bundle of long-\nterm options on your company's stock.\nShareholders should understand that companies incur costs when\nthey deliver something of value to another party and not just when\ncash changes hands.\nMoreover, it is both silly and cynical to say\nthat an important item of cost should not be recognized simply\nbecause it can't be quantified with pinpoint precision.\nRight now,\naccounting abounds with imprecision.\nAfter all, no manager or\nauditor knows how long a 747 is going to last, which means he also\ndoes not know what the yearly depreciation charge for the plane\nshould be.\nNo one knows with any certainty what a bank's annual\nloan loss charge ought to be.\nAnd the estimates of losses that\nproperty-casualty companies make are notoriously inaccurate.\nDoes this mean that these important items of cost should be\nignored simply because they can't be quantified with absolute\naccuracy?\nOf course not.\nRather, these costs should be estimated\nby honest and experienced people and then recorded.\nWhen you get\nright down to it, what other item of major but hard-to-precisely-\ncalculate cost - other, that is, than stock options - does the\naccounting profession say should be ignored in the calculation of\nearnings?\nMoreover, options are just not that difficult to value.\nAdmittedly, the difficulty is increased by the fact that the\noptions given to executives are restricted in various ways.\nThese\nrestrictions affect value.\nThey do not, however, eliminate it.\nIn\nfact, since I'm in the mood for offers, I'll make one to any\nexecutive who is granted a restricted option, even though it may be\nout of the money:\nOn the day of issue, Berkshire will pay him or\nher a substantial sum for the right to any future gain he or she\nrealizes on the option.\nSo if you find a CEO who says his newly-\nissued options have little or no value, tell him to try us out.\nIn\ntruth, we have far more confidence in our ability to determine an\nappropriate price to pay for an option than we have in our ability\nto determine the proper depreciation rate for our corporate jet.\nIt seems to me that the realities of stock options can be\nsummarized quite simply:\nIf options aren't a form of compensation,\nwhat are they?\nIf compensation isn't an expense, what is it?\nAnd,\nif expenses shouldn't go into the calculation of earnings, where in\nthe world should they go?\nThe accounting profession and the SEC should be shamed by the\nfact that they have long let themselves be muscled by business\nexecutives on the option-accounting issue.\nAdditionally, the\nlobbying that executives engage in may have an unfortunate by-\nproduct:\nIn my opinion, the business elite risks losing its\ncredibility on issues of significance to society - about which it\nmay have much of value to say - when it advocates the incredible on\nissues of significance to itself.\nMiscellaneous\nWe have two pieces of regrettable news this year.\nFirst,\nGladys Kaiser, my friend and assistant for twenty-five years, will\ngive up the latter post after the 1993 annual meeting, though she\nwill certainly remain my friend forever.\nGladys and I have been a\nteam, and though I knew her retirement was coming, it is still a\njolt.\nSecondly, in September, Verne McKenzie relinquished his role\nas Chief Financial Officer after a 30-year association with me that\nbegan when he was the outside auditor of Buffett Partnership, Ltd.\nVerne is staying on as a consultant, and though that job\ndescription is often a euphemism, in this case it has real meaning.\nI expect Verne to continue to fill an important role at Berkshire\nbut to do so at his own pace.\nMarc Hamburg, Verne's understudy for\nfive years, has succeeded him as Chief Financial Officer.\nI recall that one woman, upon being asked to describe the\nperfect spouse, specified an archeologist: \"The older I get,\" she\nsaid, \"the more he'll be interested in me.\"\nShe would have liked\nmy tastes:\nI treasure those extraordinary Berkshire managers who\nare working well past normal retirement age and who concomitantly\nare achieving results much superior to those of their younger\ncompetitors.\nWhile I understand and empathize with the decision of\nVerne and Gladys to retire when the calendar says it's time, theirs\nis not a step I wish to encourage.\nIt's hard to teach a new dog\nold tricks.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nI am a moderate in my views about retirement compared to Rose\nBlumkin, better known as Mrs. B.\nAt 99, she continues to work\nseven days a week.\nAnd about her, I have some particularly good\nnews.\nYou will remember that after her family sold 80% of Nebraska\nFurniture Mart (NFM) to Berkshire in 1983, Mrs. B continued to be\nChairman and run the carpet operation.\nIn 1989, however, she left\nbecause of a managerial disagreement and opened up her own\noperation next door in a large building that she had owned for\nseveral years.\nIn her new business, she ran the carpet section but\nleased out other home-furnishings departments.\nAt the end of last year, Mrs. B decided to sell her building\nand land to NFM.\nShe'll continue, however, to run her carpet\nbusiness at its current location (no sense slowing down just when\nyou're hitting full stride).\nNFM will set up shop alongside her,\nin that same building, thereby making a major addition to its\nfurniture business.\nI am delighted that Mrs. B has again linked up with us.\nHer\nbusiness story has no parallel and I have always been a fan of\nhers, whether she was a partner or a competitor.\nBut believe me,\npartner is better.\nThis time around, Mrs. B graciously offered to sign a non-\ncompete agreement - and I, having been incautious on this point\nwhen she was 89, snapped at the deal.\nMrs. B belongs in the\nGuinness Book of World Records on many counts.\nSigning a non-\ncompete at 99 merely adds one more.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nRalph Schey, CEO of Scott Fetzer and a manager who I hope is\nwith us at 99 also, hit a grand slam last year when that company\nearned a record $110 million pre-tax.\nWhat's even more impressive\nis that Scott Fetzer achieved such earnings while employing only\n$116 million of equity capital.\nThis extraordinary result is not\nthe product of leverage:\nThe company uses only minor amounts of\nborrowed money (except for the debt it employs - appropriately - in\nits finance subsidiary).\nScott Fetzer now operates with a significantly smaller\ninvestment in both inventory and fixed assets than it had when we\nbought it in 1986.\nThis means the company has been able to\ndistribute more than 100% of its earnings to Berkshire during our\nseven years of ownership while concurrently increasing its earnings\nstream - which was excellent to begin with - by a lot.\nRalph just\nkeeps on outdoing himself, and Berkshire shareholders owe him a\ngreat deal.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThose readers with particularly sharp eyes will note that our\ncorporate expense fell from $5.6 million in 1991 to $4.2 million in\n1992.\nPerhaps you will think that I have sold our corporate jet,\nThe Indefensible.\nForget it!\nI find the thought of retiring the\nplane even more revolting than the thought of retiring the\nChairman.\n(In this matter I've demonstrated uncharacteristic\nflexibility:\nFor years I argued passionately against corporate\njets.\nBut finally my dogma was run over by my karma.)\nOur reduction in corporate overhead actually came about\nbecause those expenses were especially high in 1991, when we\nincurred a one-time environmental charge relating to alleged pre-\n1970 actions of our textile operation.\nNow that things are back to\nnormal, our after-tax overhead costs are under 1% of our reported\noperating earnings and less than 1/2 of 1% of our look-through\nearnings.\nWe have no legal, personnel, public relations, investor\nrelations, or strategic planning departments.\nIn turn this means\nwe don't need support personnel such as guards, drivers,\nmessengers, etc.\nFinally, except for Verne, we employ no\nconsultants.\nProfessor Parkinson would like our operation - though\nCharlie, I must say, still finds it outrageously fat.\nAt some companies, corporate expense runs 10% or more of\noperating earnings.\nThe tithing that operations thus makes to\nheadquarters not only hurts earnings, but more importantly slashes\ncapital values.\nIf the business that spends 10% on headquarters'\ncosts achieves earnings at its operating levels identical to those\nachieved by the business that incurs costs of only 1%, shareholders\nof the first enterprise suffer a 9% loss in the value of their\nholdings simply because of corporate overhead.\nCharlie and I have\nobserved no correlation between high corporate costs and good\ncorporate performance.\nIn fact, we see the simpler, low-cost\noperation as more likely to operate effectively than its\nbureaucratic brethren.\nWe're admirers of the Wal-Mart, Nucor,\nDover, GEICO, Golden West Financial and Price Co. models.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nLate last year Berkshire's stock price crossed $10,000.\nSeveral shareholders have mentioned to me that the high price\ncauses them problems:\nThey like to give shares away each year and\nfind themselves impeded by the tax rule that draws a distinction\nbetween annual gifts of $10,000 or under to a single individual and\nthose above $10,000.\nThat is, those gifts no greater than $10,000\nare completely tax-free; those above $10,000 require the donor to\nuse up a portion of his or her lifetime exemption from gift and\nestate taxes, or, if that exemption has been exhausted, to pay gift\ntaxes.\nI can suggest three ways to address this problem.\nThe first\nwould be useful to a married shareholder, who can give up to\n$20,000 annually to a single recipient, as long as the donor files\na gift tax return containing his or her spouse's written consent to\ngifts made during the year.\nSecondly, a shareholder, married or not, can make a bargain\nsale.\nImagine, for example, that Berkshire is selling for $12,000\nand that one wishes to make only a $10,000 gift.\nIn that case,\nsell the stock to the giftee for $2,000.\n(Caution:\nYou will be\ntaxed on the amount, if any, by which the sales price to your\ngiftee exceeds your tax basis.)\nFinally, you can establish a partnership with people to whom\nyou are making gifts, fund it with Berkshire shares, and simply\ngive percentage interests in the partnership away each year.\nThese\ninterests can be for any value that you select.\nIf the value is\n$10,000 or less, the gift will be tax-free.\nWe issue the customary warning:\nConsult with your own tax\nadvisor before taking action on any of the more esoteric methods of\ngift-making.\nWe hold to the view about stock splits that we set forth in\nthe 1983 Annual Report.\nOverall, we believe our owner-related\npolicies - including the no-split policy - have helped us assemble\na body of shareholders that is the best associated with any widely-\nheld American corporation.\nOur shareholders think and behave like\nrational long-term owners and view the business much as Charlie and\nI do.\nConsequently, our stock consistently trades in a price range\nthat is sensibly related to intrinsic value.\nAdditionally, we believe that our shares turn over far less\nactively than do the shares of any other widely-held company.\nThe\nfrictional costs of trading - which act as a major \"tax\" on the\nowners of many companies - are virtually non-existent at Berkshire.\n(The market-making skills of Jim Maguire, our New York Stock\nExchange specialist, definitely help to keep these costs low.)\nObviously a split would not change this situation dramatically.\nNonetheless, there is no way that our shareholder group would be\nupgraded by the new shareholders enticed by a split.\nInstead we\nbelieve that modest degradation would occur.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAs I mentioned earlier, on December 16th we called our zero-\ncoupon, convertible debentures for payment on January 4, 1993.\nThese obligations bore interest at 5 1/2%, a low cost for funds\nwhen they were issued in 1989, but an unattractive rate for us at\nthe time of call.\nThe debentures could have been redeemed at the option of the\nholder in September 1994, and 5 1/2% money available for no longer\nthan that is not now of interest to us.\nFurthermore, Berkshire\nshareholders are disadvantaged by having a conversion option\noutstanding.\nAt the time we issued the debentures, this\ndisadvantage was offset by the attractive interest rate they\ncarried; by late 1992, it was not.\nIn general, we continue to have an aversion to debt,\nparticularly the short-term kind.\nBut we are willing to incur\nmodest amounts of debt when it is both properly structured and of\nsignificant benefit to shareholders.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAbout 97% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshire's\n1992 shareholder-designated contributions program.\nContributions\nmade through the program were $7.6 million, and 2,810 charities\nwere recipients.\nI'm considering increasing these contributions in\nthe future at a rate greater than the increase in Berkshire's book\nvalue, and I would be glad to hear from you as to your thinking\nabout this idea.\nWe suggest that new shareholders read the description of our\nshareholder-designated contributions program that appears on pages\n48-49. To participate in future programs, you must make sure your\nshares are registered in the name of the actual owner, not in the\nnominee name of a broker, bank or depository.\nShares not so\nregistered on August 31, 1993 will be ineligible for the 1993\nprogram.\nIn addition to the shareholder-designated contributions that\nBerkshire distributes, managers of our operating businesses make\ncontributions, including merchandise, averaging about $2.0 million\nannually.\nThese contributions support local charities, such as The\nUnited Way, and produce roughly commensurate benefits for our\nbusinesses.\nHowever, neither our operating managers nor officers of the\nparent company use Berkshire funds to make contributions to broad\nnational programs or charitable activities of special personal\ninterest to them, except to the extent they do so as shareholders.\nIf your employees, including your CEO, wish to give to their alma\nmaters or other institutions to which they feel a personal\nattachment, we believe they should use their own money, not yours.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThis year the Annual Meeting will be held at the Orpheum\nTheater in downtown Omaha at 9:30 a.m. on Monday, April 26, 1993.\nA record 1,700 people turned up for the meeting last year, but that\nnumber still leaves plenty of room at the Orpheum.\nWe recommend that you get your hotel reservations early at one\nof these hotels: (1) The Radisson-Redick Tower, a small (88 rooms)\nbut nice hotel across the street from the Orpheum; (2) the much\nlarger Red Lion Hotel, located about a five-minute walk from the\nOrpheum; or (3) the Marriott, located in West Omaha about 100 yards\nfrom Borsheim's, which is a twenty minute drive from downtown. We\nwill have buses at the Marriott that will leave at 8:30 and 8:45\nfor the meeting and return after it ends.\nCharlie and I always enjoy the meeting, and we hope you can\nmake it. The quality of our shareholders is reflected in the\nquality of the questions we get: We have never attended an annual\nmeeting anywhere that features such a consistently high level of\nintelligent, owner-related questions.\nAn attachment to our proxy material explains how you can\nobtain the card you will need for admission to the meeting. With\nthe admission card, we will enclose information about parking\nfacilities located near the Orpheum. If you are driving, come a\nlittle early. Nearby lots fill up quickly and you may have to walk\na few blocks.\nAs usual, we will have buses to take you to Nebraska Furniture\nMart and Borsheim's after the meeting and to take you from there to\ndowntown hotels or the airport later. I hope that you will allow\nplenty of time to fully explore the attractions of both stores.\nThose of you arriving early can visit the Furniture Mart any day of\nthe week; it is open from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays and\nfrom noon to 5:30 p.m. on Sundays. While there, stop at the See's\nCandy Cart and find out for yourself why Charlie and I are a good\nbit wider than we were back in 1972 when we bought See's.\nBorsheim's normally is closed on Sunday but will be open for\nshareholders and their guests from noon to 6 p.m. on Sunday, April\n25.\nCharlie and I will be in attendance, sporting our jeweler's\nloupes, and ready to give advice about gems to anyone foolish\nenough to listen.\nAlso available will be plenty of Cherry Cokes,\nSee's candies, and other lesser goodies.\nI hope you will join us.\nWarren E.

    "text": "Chairman's Letter - 1993\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOur per-share book value increased 14.3% during 1993.\nOver\nthe last 29 years (that is, since present management took over)\nbook value has grown from $19 to $8,854, or at a rate of 23.3%\ncompounded annually.\nDuring the year, Berkshire's net worth increased by $1.5\nbillion, a figure affected by two negative and two positive non-\noperating items.\nFor the sake of completeness, I'll explain them\nhere.\nIf you aren't thrilled by accounting, however, feel free\nto fast-forward through this discussion:\n1.\nThe first negative was produced by a change in\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)\nhaving to do with the taxes we accrue against\nunrealized appreciation in the securities we\ncarry at market value.\nThe old rule said that\nthe tax rate used should be the one in effect\nwhen the appreciation took place.\nTherefore,\nat the end of 1992, we were using a rate of 34%\non the $6.4 billion of gains generated after\n1986 and 28% on the $1.2 billion of gains\ngenerated before that.\nThe new rule stipulates\nthat the current tax rate should be applied to\nall gains.\nThe rate in the first quarter of\n1993, when this rule went into effect, was 34%.\nApplying that rate to our pre-1987 gains\nreduced net worth by $70 million.\n2.\nThe second negative, related to the first, came\nabout because the corporate tax rate was raised\nin the third quarter of 1993 to 35%.\nThis\nchange required us to make an additional charge\nof 1% against all of our unrealized gains, and\nthat charge penalized net worth by $75 million.\nOddly, GAAP required both this charge and the\none described above to be deducted from the\nearnings we report, even though the unrealized\nappreciation that gave rise to the charges was\nnever included in earnings, but rather was\ncredited directly to net worth.\n3.\nAnother 1993 change in GAAP affects the value\nat which we carry the securities that we own.\nIn recent years, both the common stocks and\ncertain common-equivalent securities held by\nour insurance companies have been valued at\nmarket, whereas equities held by our non-\ninsurance subsidiaries or by the parent company\nwere carried at their aggregate cost or market,\nwhichever was lower.\nNow GAAP says that all\ncommon stocks should be carried at market, a\nrule we began following in the fourth quarter\nof 1993.\nThis change produced a gain in\nBerkshire's reported net worth of about $172\nmillion.\n4.\nFinally, we issued some stock last year.\nIn a\ntransaction described in last year's Annual\nReport, we issued 3,944 shares in early\nJanuary, 1993 upon the conversion of $46\nmillion convertible debentures that we had\ncalled for redemption.\nAdditionally, we issued\n25,203 shares when we acquired Dexter Shoe, a\npurchase discussed later in this report.\nThe\noverall result was that our shares outstanding\nincreased by 29,147 and our net worth by about\n$478 million.\nPer-share book value also grew,\nbecause the shares issued in these transactions\ncarried a price above their book value.\nOf course, it's per-share intrinsic value, not book value,\nthat counts.\nBook value is an accounting term that measures the\ncapital, including retained earnings, that has been put into a\nbusiness.\nIntrinsic value is a present-value estimate of the\ncash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining\nlife.\nAt most companies, the two values are unrelated.\nBerkshire, however, is an exception:\nOur book value, though\nsignificantly below our intrinsic value, serves as a useful\ndevice for tracking that key figure.\nIn 1993, each measure grew\nby roughly 14%, advances that I would call satisfactory but\nunexciting.\nThese gains, however, were outstripped by a much larger gain\n- 39% - in Berkshire's market price.\nOver time, of course,\nmarket price and intrinsic value will arrive at about the same\ndestination.\nBut in the short run the two often diverge in a\nmajor way, a phenomenon I've discussed in the past.\nTwo years\nago, Coca-Cola and Gillette, both large holdings of ours, enjoyed\nmarket price increases that dramatically outpaced their earnings\ngains.\nIn the 1991 Annual Report, I said that the stocks of\nthese companies could not continuously overperform their\nbusinesses.\nFrom 1991 to 1993, Coke and Gillette increased their annual\noperating earnings per share by 38% and 37% respectively, but\ntheir market prices moved up only 11% and 6%.\nIn other words,\nthe companies overperformed their stocks, a result that no doubt\npartly reflects Wall Street's new apprehension about brand names.\nWhatever the reason, what will count over time is the earnings\nperformance of these companies.\nIf they prosper, Berkshire will\nalso prosper, though not in a lock-step manner.\nLet me add a lesson from history:\nCoke went public in 1919\nat $40 per share.\nBy the end of 1920 the market, coldly\nreevaluating Coke's future prospects, had battered the stock down\nby more than 50%, to $19.50.\nAt yearend 1993, that single share,\nwith dividends reinvested, was worth more than $2.1 million.\nAs\nBen Graham said:\n\"In the short-run, the market is a voting\nmachine - reflecting a voter-registration test that requires only\nmoney, not intelligence or emotional stability - but in the long-\nrun, the market is a weighing machine.\"\nSo how should Berkshire's over-performance in the market\nlast year be viewed?\nClearly, Berkshire was selling at a higher\npercentage of intrinsic value at the end of 1993 than was the\ncase at the beginning of the year.\nOn the other hand, in a world\nof 6% or 7% long-term interest rates, Berkshire's market price\nwas not inappropriate if - and you should understand that this is\na huge if - Charlie Munger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman, and I can\nattain our long-standing goal of increasing Berkshire's per-share\nintrinsic value at an average annual rate of 15%.\nWe have not\nretreated from this goal.\nBut we again emphasize, as we have for\nmany years, that the growth in our capital base makes 15% an\never-more difficult target to hit.\nWhat we have going for us is a growing collection of good-\nsized operating businesses that possess economic characteristics\nranging from good to terrific, run by managers whose performance\nranges from terrific to terrific.\nYou need have no worries about\nthis group.\nThe capital-allocation work that Charlie and I do at the\nparent company, using the funds that our managers deliver to us,\nhas a less certain outcome:\nIt is not easy to find new\nbusinesses and managers comparable to those we have.\nDespite\nthat difficulty, Charlie and I relish the search, and we are\nhappy to report an important success in 1993.\nDexter Shoe\nWhat we did last year was build on our 1991 purchase of H.\nH. Brown, a superbly-run manufacturer of work shoes, boots and\nother footwear.\nBrown has been a real winner:\nThough we had\nhigh hopes to begin with, these expectations have been\nconsiderably exceeded thanks to Frank Rooney, Jim Issler and the\ntalented managers who work with them.\nBecause of our confidence\nin Frank's team, we next acquired Lowell Shoe, at the end of\n1992.\nLowell was a long-established manufacturer of women's and\nnurses' shoes, but its business needed some fixing.\nAgain,\nresults have surpassed our expectations.\nSo we promptly jumped\nat the chance last year to acquire Dexter Shoe of Dexter, Maine,\nwhich manufactures popular-priced men's and women's shoes.\nDexter, I can assure you, needs no fixing:\nIt is one of the\nbest-managed companies Charlie and I have seen in our business\nlifetimes.\nHarold Alfond, who started working in a shoe factory at 25\ncents an hour when he was 20, founded Dexter in 1956 with $10,000\nof capital.\nHe was joined in 1958 by Peter Lunder, his nephew.\nThe two of them have since built a business that now produces over\n7.5 million pairs of shoes annually, most of them made in Maine\nand the balance in Puerto Rico.\nAs you probably know, the\ndomestic shoe industry is generally thought to be unable to\ncompete with imports from low-wage countries.\nBut someone forgot\nto tell this to the ingenious managements of Dexter and H. H.\nBrown and to their skilled labor forces, which together make the\nU.S. plants of both companies highly competitive against all\ncomers.\nDexter's business includes 77 retail outlets, located\nprimarily in the Northeast.\nThe company is also a major\nmanufacturer of golf shoes, producing about 15% of U.S. output.\nIts bread and butter, though, is the manufacture of traditional\nshoes for traditional retailers, a job at which it excels:\nLast\nyear both Nordstrom and J.C. Penney bestowed special awards upon\nDexter for its performance as a supplier during 1992.\nOur 1993 results include Dexter only from our date of\nmerger, November 7th.\nIn 1994, we expect Berkshire's shoe\noperations to have more than $550 million in sales, and we would\nnot be surprised if the combined pre-tax earnings of these\nbusinesses topped $85 million.\nFive years ago we had no thought\nof getting into shoes.\nNow we have 7,200 employees in that\nindustry, and I sing \"There's No Business Like Shoe Business\" as\nI drive to work.\nSo much for strategic plans.\nAt Berkshire, we have no view of the future that dictates\nwhat businesses or industries we will enter.\nIndeed, we think\nit's usually poison for a corporate giant's shareholders if it\nembarks upon new ventures pursuant to some grand vision.\nWe\nprefer instead to focus on the economic characteristics of\nbusinesses that we wish to own and the personal characteristics\nof managers with whom we wish to associate - and then to hope we\nget lucky in finding the two in combination.\nAt Dexter, we did.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAnd now we pause for a short commercial:\nThough they owned\na business jewel, we believe that Harold and Peter (who were not\ninterested in cash) made a sound decision in exchanging their\nDexter stock for shares of Berkshire.\nWhat they did, in effect,\nwas trade a 100% interest in a single terrific business for a\nsmaller interest in a large group of terrific businesses.\nThey\nincurred no tax on this exchange and now own a security that can\nbe easily used for charitable or personal gifts, or that can be\nconverted to cash in amounts, and at times, of their own\nchoosing.\nShould members of their families desire to, they can\npursue varying financial paths without running into the\ncomplications that often arise when assets are concentrated in a\nprivate business.\nFor tax and other reasons, private companies also often find\nit difficult to diversify outside their industries.\nBerkshire,\nin contrast, can diversify with ease.\nSo in shifting their\nownership to Berkshire, Dexter's shareholders solved a\nreinvestment problem.\nMoreover, though Harold and Peter now have\nnon-controlling shares in Berkshire, rather than controlling\nshares in Dexter, they know they will be treated as partners and\nthat we will follow owner-oriented practices.\nIf they elect to\nretain their Berkshire shares, their investment result from the\nmerger date forward will exactly parallel my own result.\nSince I\nhave a huge percentage of my net worth committed for life to\nBerkshire shares - and since the company will issue me neither\nrestricted shares nor stock options - my gain-loss equation will\nalways match that of all other owners.\nAdditionally, Harold and Peter know that at Berkshire we can\nkeep our promises:\nThere will be no changes of control or\nculture at Berkshire for many decades to come.\nFinally, and of\nparamount importance, Harold and Peter can be sure that they will\nget to run their business - an activity they dearly love -\nexactly as they did before the merger.\nAt Berkshire, we do not\ntell .400 hitters how to swing.\nWhat made sense for Harold and Peter probably makes sense\nfor a few other owners of large private businesses.\nSo, if you\nhave a business that might fit, let me hear from you.\nOur\nacquisition criteria are set forth in the appendix on page 22.\nSources of Reported Earnings\nThe table below shows the major sources of Berkshire's\nreported earnings.\nIn this presentation, amortization of\nGoodwill and other major purchase-price accounting adjustments\nare not charged against the specific businesses to which they\napply, but are instead aggregated and shown separately.\nThis\nprocedure lets you view the earnings of our businesses as they\nwould have been reported had we not purchased them.\nI've\nexplained in past reports why this form of presentation seems to\nus to be more useful to investors and managers than one utilizing\nGAAP, which requires purchase-price adjustments to be made on a\nbusiness-by-business basis.\nThe total net earnings we show in\nthe table are, of course, identical to the GAAP total in our\naudited financial statements.\n(000s omitted)\n------------------------------------------\nBerkshire's Share\nof Net Earnings\n(after taxes and\nPre-Tax Earnings\nminority interests)\n----------------------\n------------------\n1993\n1992\n1993\n1992\n----------\n----------\n--------\n--------\nOperating Earnings:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting ...............\n$ 30,876\n$(108,961)\n$ 20,156\n$(71,141)\nNet Investment Income ......\n375,946\n355,067\n321,321\n305,763\nH.

and will - change\nin unexpected ways and at unexpected times.\nIn the meantime, we'll\ntry to resist the temptation to do something marginal simply\nbecause we are long on cash.\nThere's no use running if you're on\nthe wrong road.\nThe following table shows how we calculate look-through\nearnings, though I warn you that the figures are necessarily very\nrough.\n(The dividends paid to us by these investees have been\nincluded in the operating earnings itemized on page 8, mostly\nunder \"Insurance Group:\nNet Investment Income.\")\nBerkshire's Share\nof Undistributed\nBerkshire's Approximate\nOperating Earnings\nBerkshire's Major Investees\nOwnership at Yearend\n(in millions)\n---------------------------\n-----------------------\n--------------------\n1993\n1992\n1993\n1992\n------\n------\n------\n------\nCapital Cities/ABC, Inc. .....\n13.0%\n18.2%\n$ 83(2)\n$ 70\nThe Coca-Cola Company ........\n7.2%\n7.1%\n94\n82\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.\n6.8%(1)\n8.2%(1)\n41(2)\n29(2)\nGEICO Corp. ..................\n48.4%\n48.1%\n76(3)\n34(3)\nGeneral Dynamics Corp. .......\n13.9%\n14.1%\n25\n11(2)\nThe Gillette Company .........\n10.9%\n10.9%\n44\n38\nGuinness PLC .................\n1.9%\n2.0%\n8\n7\nThe Washington Post Company ..\n14.8%\n14.6%\n15\n11\nWells Fargo & Company ........\n12.2%\n11.5%\n53(2)\n16(2)\nBerkshire's share of undistributed\nearnings of major investees\n$439\n$298\nHypothetical tax on these undistributed\ninvestee earnings(4)\n(61)\n(42)\nReported operating earnings of Berkshire\n478\n348\nTotal look-through earnings of Berkshire\n$856\n$604\n(1) Does not include shares allocable to the minority interest\nat Wesco\n(2) Calculated on average ownership for the year\n(3) Excludes realized capital gains, which have been both\nrecurring and significant\n(4) The tax rate used is 14%, which is the rate Berkshire pays\non the dividends it receives\nWe have told you that we expect the undistributed,\nhypothetically-taxed earnings of our investees to produce at least\nequivalent gains in Berkshire's intrinsic value.\nTo date, we have\nfar exceeded that expectation.\nFor example, in 1986 we bought\nthree million shares of Capital Cities/ABC for $172.50 per share\nand late last year sold one-third of that holding for $630 per\nshare.\nAfter paying 35% capital gains taxes, we realized a $297\nmillion profit from the sale.\nIn contrast, during the eight years\nwe held these shares, the retained earnings of Cap Cities\nattributable to them - hypothetically taxed at a lower 14% in\naccordance with our look-through method - were only $152 million.\nIn other words, we paid a much larger tax bill than our look-\nthrough presentations to you have assumed and nonetheless realized\na gain that far exceeded the undistributed earnings allocable to\nthese shares.\nWe expect such pleasant outcomes to recur often in the future\nand therefore believe our look-through earnings to be a\nconservative representation of Berkshire's true economic earnings.\nTaxes\nAs our Cap Cities sale emphasizes, Berkshire is a substantial\npayer of federal income taxes.\nIn aggregate, we will pay 1993\nfederal income taxes of $390 million, about $200 million of that\nattributable to operating earnings and $190 million to realized\ncapital gains.\nFurthermore, our share of the 1993 federal and\nforeign income taxes paid by our investees is well over $400\nmillion, a figure you don't see on our financial statements but\nthat is nonetheless real.\nDirectly and indirectly, Berkshire's\n1993 federal income tax payments will be about 1/2 of 1% of the total\npaid last year by all American corporations.\nSpeaking for our own shares, Charlie and I have absolutely no\ncomplaint about these taxes.\nWe know we work in a market-based\neconomy that rewards our efforts far more bountifully than it does\nthe efforts of others whose output is of equal or greater benefit\nto society.\nTaxation should, and does, partially redress this\ninequity.\nBut we still remain extraordinarily well-treated.\nBerkshire and its shareholders, in combination, would pay a\nmuch smaller tax if Berkshire operated as a partnership or \"S\"\ncorporation, two structures often used for business activities.\nFor a variety of reasons, that's not feasible for Berkshire to do.\nHowever, the penalty our corporate form imposes is mitigated -\nthough far from eliminated - by our strategy of investing for the\nlong term.\nCharlie and I would follow a buy-and-hold policy even\nif we ran a tax-exempt institution.\nWe think it the soundest way\nto invest, and it also goes down the grain of our personalities.\nA\nthird reason to favor this policy, however, is the fact that taxes\nare due only when gains are realized.\nThrough my favorite comic strip, Li'l Abner, I got a chance\nduring my youth to see the benefits of delayed taxes, though I\nmissed the lesson at the time.\nMaking his readers feel superior,\nLi'l Abner bungled happily, but moronically, through life in\nDogpatch.\nAt one point he became infatuated with a New York\ntemptress, Appassionatta Van Climax, but despaired of marrying her\nbecause he had only a single silver dollar and she was interested\nsolely in millionaires.\nDejected, Abner took his problem to Old\nMan Mose, the font of all knowledge in Dogpatch.\nSaid the sage:\nDouble your money 20 times and Appassionatta will be yours (1, 2,\n4, 8 . . . . 1,048,576).\nMy last memory of the strip is Abner entering a roadhouse,\ndropping his dollar into a slot machine, and hitting a jackpot that\nspilled money all over the floor.\nMeticulously following Mose's\nadvice, Abner picked up two dollars and went off to find his next\ndouble.\nWhereupon I dumped Abner and began reading Ben Graham.\nMose clearly was overrated as a guru:\nBesides failing to\nanticipate Abner's slavish obedience to instructions, he also\nforgot about taxes.\nHad Abner been subject, say, to the 35%\nfederal tax rate that Berkshire pays, and had he managed one double\nannually, he would after 20 years only have accumulated $22,370.\nIndeed, had he kept on both getting his annual doubles and paying a\n35% tax on each, he would have needed 7 1/2 years more to reach the\n$1 million required to win Appassionatta.\nBut what if Abner had instead put his dollar in a single\ninvestment and held it until it doubled the same 27 1/2 times?\nIn\nthat case, he would have realized about $200 million pre-tax or,\nafter paying a $70 million tax in the final year, about $130\nmillion after-tax.\nFor that, Appassionatta would have crawled to\nDogpatch.\nOf course, with 27 1/2 years having passed, how\nAppassionatta would have looked to a fellow sitting on $130 million\nis another question.\nWhat this little tale tells us is that tax-paying investors\nwill realize a far, far greater sum from a single investment that\ncompounds internally at a given rate than from a succession of\ninvestments compounding at the same rate.\nBut I suspect many\nBerkshire shareholders figured that out long ago.\nInsurance Operations\nAt this point in the report we've customarily provided you\nwith a table showing the annual \"combined ratio\" of the insurance\nindustry for the preceding decade.\nThis ratio compares total\ninsurance costs (losses incurred plus expenses) to revenue from\npremiums.\nFor many years, the ratio has been above 100, a level\nindicating an underwriting loss.\nThat is, the industry has taken\nin less money each year from its policyholders than it has had to\npay for operating expenses and for loss events that occurred during\nthe year.\nOffsetting this grim equation is a happier fact:\nInsurers get\nto hold on to their policyholders' money for a time before paying\nit out.\nThis happens because most policies require that premiums\nbe prepaid and, more importantly, because it often takes time to\nresolve loss claims.\nIndeed, in the case of certain lines of\ninsurance, such as product liability or professional malpractice,\nmany years may elapse between the loss event and payment.\nTo oversimplify the matter somewhat, the total of the funds\nprepaid by policyholders and the funds earmarked for incurred-but-\nnot-yet-paid claims is called \"the float.\" In the past, the\nindustry was able to suffer a combined ratio of 107 to 111 and\nstill break even from its insurance writings because of the\nearnings derived from investing this float.\nAs interest rates have fallen, however, the value of float has\nsubstantially declined.\nTherefore, the data that we have provided\nin the past are no longer useful for year-to-year comparisons of\nindustry profitability.\nA company writing at the same combined\nratio now as in the 1980's today has a far less attractive business\nthan it did then.\nOnly by making an analysis that incorporates both underwriting\nresults and the current risk-free earnings obtainable from float\ncan one evaluate the true economics of the business that a\nproperty-casualty insurer writes.\nOf course, the actual investment\nresults that an insurer achieves from the use of both float and\nstockholders' funds is also of major importance and should be\ncarefully examined when an investor is assessing managerial\nperformance.\nBut that should be a separate analysis from the one\nwe are discussing here.\nThe value of float funds - in effect,\ntheir transfer price as they move from the insurance operation to\nthe investment operation - should be determined simply by the risk-\nfree, long-term rate of interest.\nOn the next page we show the numbers that count in an\nevaluation of Berkshire's insurance business.\nWe calculate our\nfloat - which we generate in exceptional amounts relative to our\npremium volume - by adding loss reserves, loss adjustment reserves\nand unearned premium reserves and then subtracting agent's\nbalances, prepaid acquisition costs and deferred charges applicable\nto assumed reinsurance.\nOur cost of float is determined by our\nunderwriting loss or profit.\nIn those years when we have had an\nunderwriting profit, which includes 1993, our cost of float has\nbeen negative, and we have determined our insurance earnings by\nadding underwriting profit to float income.\n(1)\n(2)\nYearend Yield\nUnderwriting\nApproximate\non Long-Term\nLoss\nAverage Float\nCost of Funds\nGovt.

but is far from as good as it sounds.\nWe temper our enthusiasm because we write a large volume of\n\"super-cat\" policies (which other insurance and reinsurance\ncompanies buy to recover part of the losses they suffer from mega-\ncatastrophes) and because last year we had no losses of consequence\nfrom this activity.\nAs that suggests, the truly catastrophic\nMidwestern floods of 1993 did not trigger super-cat losses, the\nreason being that very few flood policies are purchased from\nprivate insurers.\nIt would be fallacious, however, to conclude from this single-\nyear result that the super-cat business is a wonderful one, or even\na satisfactory one.\nA simple example will illustrate the fallacy:\nSuppose there is an event that occurs 25 times in every century.\nIf you annually give 5-for-1 odds against its occurrence that year,\nyou will have many more winning years than losers.\nIndeed, you may\ngo a straight six, seven or more years without loss.\nYou also will\neventually go broke.\nAt Berkshire, we naturally believe we are obtaining adequate\npremiums and giving more like 3 1/2-for-1 odds.\nBut there is no way\nfor us - or anyone else - to calculate the true odds on super-cat\ncoverages.\nIn fact, it will take decades for us to find out\nwhether our underwriting judgment has been sound.\nWhat we do know is that when a loss comes, it's likely to be a\nlulu.\nThere may well be years when Berkshire will suffer losses\nfrom the super-cat business equal to three or four times what we\nearned from it in 1993.\nWhen Hurricane Andrew blew in 1992, we\npaid out about $125 million.\nBecause we've since expanded our\nsuper-cat business, a similar storm today could cost us $600\nmillion.\nSo far, we have been lucky in 1994.\nAs I write this letter,\nwe are estimating that our losses from the Los Angeles earthquake\nwill be nominal.\nBut if the quake had been a 7.5 instead of a 6.8,\nit would have been a different story.\nBerkshire is ideally positioned to write super-cat policies.\nIn Ajit Jain, we have by far the best manager in this business.\nAdditionally, companies writing these policies need enormous\ncapital, and our net worth is ten to twenty times larger than that\nof our main competitors.\nIn most lines of insurance, huge\nresources aren't that important:\nAn insurer can diversify the\nrisks it writes and, if necessary, can lay off risks to reduce\nconcentration in its portfolio.\nThat isn't possible in the super-\ncat business.\nSo these competitors are forced into offering far\nsmaller limits than those we can provide.\nWere they bolder, they\nwould run the risk that a mega-catastrophe - or a confluence of\nsmaller catastrophes - would wipe them out.\nOne indication of our premier strength and reputation is that\neach of the four largest reinsurance companies in the world buys\nvery significant reinsurance coverage from Berkshire.\nBetter than\nanyone else, these giants understand that the test of a reinsurer\nis its ability and willingness to pay losses under trying\ncircumstances, not its readiness to accept premiums when things\nlook rosy.\nOne caution:\nThere has recently been a substantial increase\nin reinsurance capacity.\nClose to $5 billion of equity capital has\nbeen raised by reinsurers, almost all of them newly-formed\nentities.\nNaturally these new entrants are hungry to write\nbusiness so that they can justify the projections they utilized in\nattracting capital.\nThis new competition won't affect our 1994\noperations; we're filled up there, primarily with business written\nin 1993.\nBut we are now seeing signs of price deterioration.\nIf\nthis trend continues, we will resign ourselves to much-reduced\nvolume, keeping ourselves available, though, for the large,\nsophisticated buyer who requires a super-cat insurer with large\ncapacity and a sure ability to pay losses.\nIn other areas of our insurance business, our homestate\noperation, led by Rod Eldred; our workers' compensation business,\nheaded by Brad Kinstler; our credit-card operation, managed by the\nKizer family; and National Indemnity's traditional auto and general\nliability business, led by Don Wurster, all achieved excellent\nresults.\nIn combination, these four units produced a significant\nunderwriting profit and substantial float.\nAll in all, we have a first-class insurance business.\nThough\nits results will be highly volatile, this operation possesses an\nintrinsic value that exceeds its book value by a large amount -\nlarger, in fact, than is the case at any other Berkshire business.\nCommon Stock Investments\nBelow we list our common stockholdings having a value of over\n$250 million.\nA small portion of these investments belongs to\nsubsidiaries of which Berkshire owns less than 100%.\n12/31/93\nShares\nCompany\nCost\nMarket\n------\n-------\n----------\n----------\n(000s omitted)\n2,000,000\nCapital Cities/ABC, Inc. ............. $\n345,000\n$1,239,000\n93,400,000\nThe Coca-Cola Company. ...............\n1,023,920\n4,167,975\n13,654,600\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.\n(\"Freddie Mac\") ...................\n307,505\n681,023\n34,250,000\nGEICO Corp. ..........................\n45,713\n1,759,594\n4,350,000\nGeneral Dynamics Corp. ...............\n94,938\n401,287\n24,000,000\nThe Gillette Company .................\n600,000\n1,431,000\n38,335,000\nGuinness PLC .........................\n333,019\n270,822\n1,727,765\nThe Washington Post Company. .........\n9,731\n440,148\n6,791,218\nWells Fargo & Company ................\n423,680\n878,614\nConsidering the similarity of this year's list and the last,\nyou may decide your management is hopelessly comatose.\nBut we\ncontinue to think that it is usually foolish to part with an\ninterest in a business that is both understandable and durably\nwonderful.\nBusiness interests of that kind are simply too hard to\nreplace.\nInterestingly, corporate managers have no trouble\nunderstanding that point when they are focusing on a business they\noperate:\nA parent company that owns a subsidiary with superb long-\nterm economics is not likely to sell that entity regardless of\nprice.\n\"Why,\" the CEO would ask, \"should I part with my crown\njewel?\"\nYet that same CEO, when it comes to running his personal\ninvestment portfolio, will offhandedly - and even impetuously -\nmove from business to business when presented with no more than\nsuperficial arguments by his broker for doing so.\nThe worst of\nthese is perhaps, \"You can't go broke taking a profit.\"\nCan you\nimagine a CEO using this line to urge his board to sell a star\nsubsidiary?\nIn our view, what makes sense in business also makes\nsense in stocks:\nAn investor should ordinarily hold a small piece\nof an outstanding business with the same tenacity that an owner\nwould exhibit if he owned all of that business.\nEarlier I mentioned the financial results that could have been\nachieved by investing $40 in The Coca-Cola Co. in 1919.\nIn 1938,\nmore than 50 years after the introduction of Coke, and long after\nthe drink was firmly established as an American icon, Fortune did\nan excellent story on the company.\nIn the second paragraph the\nwriter reported:\n\"Several times every year a weighty and serious\ninvestor looks long and with profound respect at Coca-Cola's\nrecord, but comes regretfully to the conclusion that he is looking\ntoo late.\nThe specters of saturation and competition rise before\nhim.\"\nYes, competition there was in 1938 and in 1993 as well.\nBut\nit's worth noting that in 1938 The Coca-Cola Co. sold 207 million\ncases of soft drinks (if its gallonage then is converted into the\n192-ounce cases used for measurement today) and in 1993 it sold\nabout 10.7 billion cases, a 50-fold increase in physical volume\nfrom a company that in 1938 was already dominant in its very major\nindustry.\nNor was the party over in 1938 for an investor:\nThough\nthe $40 invested in 1919 in one share had (with dividends\nreinvested) turned into $3,277 by the end of 1938, a fresh $40 then\ninvested in Coca-Cola stock would have grown to $25,000 by yearend\n1993.\nI can't resist one more quote from that 1938 Fortune story:\n\"It would be hard to name any company comparable in size to Coca-\nCola and selling, as Coca-Cola does, an unchanged product that can\npoint to a ten-year record anything like Coca-Cola's.\"\nIn the 55\nyears that have since passed, Coke's product line has broadened\nsomewhat, but it's remarkable how well that description still fits.\nCharlie and I decided long ago that in an investment lifetime\nit's just too hard to make hundreds of smart decisions.\nThat\njudgment became ever more compelling as Berkshire's capital\nmushroomed and the universe of investments that could significantly\naffect our results shrank dramatically.\nTherefore, we adopted a\nstrategy that required our being smart - and not too smart at that\n- only a very few times.\nIndeed, we'll now settle for one good\nidea a year.\n(Charlie says it's my turn.)\nThe strategy we've adopted precludes our following standard\ndiversification dogma.\nMany pundits would therefore say the\nstrategy must be riskier than that employed by more conventional\ninvestors.\nWe disagree.\nWe believe that a policy of portfolio\nconcentration may well decrease risk if it raises, as it should,\nboth the intensity with which an investor thinks about a business\nand the comfort-level he must feel with its economic characteristics\nbefore buying into it.\nIn stating this opinion, we define risk,\nusing dictionary terms, as \"the possibility of loss or injury.\"\nAcademics, however, like to define investment \"risk\"\ndifferently, averring that it is the relative volatility of a stock\nor portfolio of stocks - that is, their volatility as compared to\nthat of a large universe of stocks.\nEmploying data bases and\nstatistical skills, these academics compute with precision the\n\"beta\" of a stock - its relative volatility in the past - and then\nbuild arcane investment and capital-allocation theories around this\ncalculation.\nIn their hunger for a single statistic to measure\nrisk, however, they forget a fundamental principle:\nIt is better\nto be approximately right than precisely wrong.\nFor owners of a business - and that's the way we think of\nshareholders - the academics' definition of risk is far off the\nmark, so much so that it produces absurdities.\nFor example, under\nbeta-based theory, a stock that has dropped very sharply compared\nto the market - as had Washington Post when we bought it in 1973 -\nbecomes \"riskier\" at the lower price than it was at the higher\nprice.\nWould that description have then made any sense to someone\nwho was offered the entire company at a vastly-reduced price?\nIn fact, the true investor welcomes volatility.\nBen Graham\nexplained why in Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor.\nThere he\nintroduced \"Mr. Market,\" an obliging fellow who shows up every day\nto either buy from you or sell to you, whichever you wish.\nThe\nmore manic-depressive this chap is, the greater the opportunities\navailable to the investor.\nThat's true because a wildly\nfluctuating market means that irrationally low prices will\nperiodically be attached to solid businesses.\nIt is impossible to\nsee how the availability of such prices can be thought of as\nincreasing the hazards for an investor who is totally free to\neither ignore the market or exploit its folly.\nIn assessing risk, a beta purist will disdain examining what a\ncompany produces, what its competitors are doing, or how much\nborrowed money the business employs.\nHe may even prefer not to\nknow the company's name.\nWhat he treasures is the price history of\nits stock.\nIn contrast, we'll happily forgo knowing the price\nhistory and instead will seek whatever information will further our\nunderstanding of the company's business.\nAfter we buy a stock,\nconsequently, we would not be disturbed if markets closed for a\nyear or two.\nWe don't need a daily quote on our 100% position in\nSee's or H. H. Brown to validate our well-being.\nWhy, then, should\nwe need a quote on our 7% interest in Coke?\nIn our opinion, the real risk that an investor must assess is\nwhether his aggregate after-tax receipts from an investment\n(including those he receives on sale) will, over his prospective\nholding period, give him at least as much purchasing power as he\nhad to begin with, plus a modest rate of interest on that initial\nstake.\nThough this risk cannot be calculated with engineering\nprecision, it can in some cases be judged with a degree of accuracy\nthat is useful.\nThe primary factors bearing upon this evaluation\nare:\n1) The certainty with which the long-term economic\ncharacteristics of the business can be evaluated;\n2) The certainty with which management can be evaluated,\nboth as to its ability to realize the full potential of\nthe business and to wisely employ its cash flows;\n3) The certainty with which management can be counted on\nto channel the rewards from the business to the\nshareholders rather than to itself;\n4) The purchase price of the business;\n5) The levels of taxation and inflation that will be\nexperienced and that will determine the degree by which\nan investor's purchasing-power return is reduced from his\ngross return.\nThese factors will probably strike many analysts as unbearably\nfuzzy, since they cannot be extracted from a data base of any kind.\nBut the difficulty of precisely quantifying these matters does not\nnegate their importance nor is it insuperable.\nJust as Justice\nStewart found it impossible to formulate a test for obscenity but\nnevertheless asserted, \"I know it when I see it,\" so also can\ninvestors - in an inexact but useful way - \"see\" the risks inherent\nin certain investments without reference to complex equations or\nprice histories.\nIs it really so difficult to conclude that Coca-Cola and\nGillette possess far less business risk over the long term than,\nsay, any computer company or retailer?\nWorldwide, Coke sells about\n44% of all soft drinks, and Gillette has more than a 60% share (in\nvalue) of the blade market.\nLeaving aside chewing gum, in which\nWrigley is dominant, I know of no other significant businesses in\nwhich the leading company has long enjoyed such global power.\nMoreover, both Coke and Gillette have actually increased their\nworldwide shares of market in recent years.\nThe might of their\nbrand names, the attributes of their products, and the strength of\ntheir distribution systems give them an enormous competitive\nadvantage, setting up a protective moat around their economic\ncastles.\nThe average company, in contrast, does battle daily\nwithout any such means of protection.\nAs Peter Lynch says, stocks\nof companies selling commodity-like products should come with a\nwarning label:\n\"Competition may prove hazardous to human wealth.\"\nThe competitive strengths of a Coke or Gillette are obvious to\neven the casual observer of business.\nYet the beta of their stocks\nis similar to that of a great many run-of-the-mill companies who\npossess little or no competitive advantage.\nShould we conclude\nfrom this similarity that the competitive strength of Coke and\nGillette gains them nothing when business risk is being measured?\nOr should we conclude that the risk in owning a piece of a company\n- its stock - is somehow divorced from the long-term risk inherent\nin its business operations?\nWe believe neither conclusion makes\nsense and that equating beta with investment risk also makes no\nsense.\nThe theoretician bred on beta has no mechanism for\ndifferentiating the risk inherent in, say, a single-product toy\ncompany selling pet rocks or hula hoops from that of another toy\ncompany whose sole product is Monopoly or Barbie.\nBut it's quite\npossible for ordinary investors to make such distinctions if they\nhave a reasonable understanding of consumer behavior and the\nfactors that create long-term competitive strength or weakness.\nObviously, every investor will make mistakes.\nBut by confining\nhimself to a relatively few, easy-to-understand cases, a reasonably\nintelligent, informed and diligent person can judge investment\nrisks with a useful degree of accuracy.\nIn many industries, of course, Charlie and I can't determine\nwhether we are dealing with a \"pet rock\" or a \"Barbie.\"\nWe\ncouldn't solve this problem, moreover, even if we were to spend\nyears intensely studying those industries.\nSometimes our own\nintellectual shortcomings would stand in the way of understanding,\nand in other cases the nature of the industry would be the\nroadblock.\nFor example, a business that must deal with fast-moving\ntechnology is not going to lend itself to reliable evaluations of\nits long-term economics.\nDid we foresee thirty years ago what\nwould transpire in the television-manufacturing or computer\nindustries?\nOf course not.\n(Nor did most of the investors and\ncorporate managers who enthusiastically entered those industries.)\nWhy, then, should Charlie and I now think we can predict the\nfuture of other rapidly-evolving businesses?\nWe'll stick instead\nwith the easy cases.\nWhy search for a needle buried in a haystack\nwhen one is sitting in plain sight?\nOf course, some investment strategies - for instance, our\nefforts in arbitrage over the years - require wide diversification.\nIf significant risk exists in a single transaction, overall risk\nshould be reduced by making that purchase one of many mutually-\nindependent commitments.\nThus, you may consciously purchase a\nrisky investment - one that indeed has a significant possibility of\ncausing loss or injury - if you believe that your gain, weighted\nfor probabilities, considerably exceeds your loss, comparably\nweighted, and if you can commit to a number of similar, but\nunrelated opportunities.\nMost venture capitalists employ this\nstrategy.\nShould you choose to pursue this course, you should\nadopt the outlook of the casino that owns a roulette wheel, which\nwill want to see lots of action because it is favored by\nprobabilities, but will refuse to accept a single, huge bet.\nAnother situation requiring wide diversification occurs when\nan investor who does not understand the economics of specific\nbusinesses nevertheless believes it in his interest to be a long-\nterm owner of American industry.\nThat investor should both own a\nlarge number of equities and space out his purchases.\nBy\nperiodically investing in an index fund, for example, the know-\nnothing investor can actually out-perform most investment\nprofessionals.\nParadoxically, when \"dumb\" money acknowledges its\nlimitations, it ceases to be dumb.\nOn the other hand, if you are a know-something investor, able\nto understand business economics and to find five to ten sensibly-\npriced companies that possess important long-term competitive\nadvantages, conventional diversification makes no sense for you.\nIt is apt simply to hurt your results and increase your risk.\nI\ncannot understand why an investor of that sort elects to put money\ninto a business that is his 20th favorite rather than simply adding\nthat money to his top choices - the businesses he understands best\nand that present the least risk, along with the greatest profit\npotential.\nIn the words of the prophet Mae West:\n\"Too much of a\ngood thing can be wonderful.\"\nCorporate Governance\nAt our annual meetings, someone usually asks \"What happens to\nthis place if you get hit by a truck?\"\nI'm glad they are still\nasking the question in this form.\nIt won't be too long before the\nquery becomes:\n\"What happens to this place if you don't get hit by\na truck?\"\nSuch questions, in any event, raise a reason for me to discuss\ncorporate governance, a hot topic during the past year.\nIn\ngeneral, I believe that directors have stiffened their spines\nrecently and that shareholders are now being treated somewhat more\nlike true owners than was the case not long ago.\nCommentators on\ncorporate governance, however, seldom make any distinction among\nthree fundamentally different manager/owner situations that exist\nin publicly-held companies.\nThough the legal responsibility of\ndirectors is identical throughout, their ability to effect change\ndiffers in each of the cases.\nAttention usually falls on the first\ncase, because it prevails on the corporate scene.\nSince Berkshire\nfalls into the second category, however, and will someday fall into\nthe third, we will discuss all three variations.\nThe first, and by far most common, board situation is one in\nwhich a corporation has no controlling shareholder.\nIn that case,\nI believe directors should behave as if there is a single absentee\nowner, whose long-term interest they should try to further in all\nproper ways.\nUnfortunately, \"long-term\" gives directors a lot of\nwiggle room.\nIf they lack either integrity or the ability to think\nindependently, directors can do great violence to shareholders\nwhile still claiming to be acting in their long-term interest.\nBut\nassume the board is functioning well and must deal with a\nmanagement that is mediocre or worse.\nDirectors then have the\nresponsibility for changing that management, just as an intelligent\nowner would do if he were present.\nAnd if able but greedy managers\nover-reach and try to dip too deeply into the shareholders'\npockets, directors must slap their hands.\nIn this plain-vanilla case, a director who sees something he\ndoesn't like should attempt to persuade the other directors of his\nviews.\nIf he is successful, the board will have the muscle to make\nthe appropriate change.\nSuppose, though, that the unhappy director\ncan't get other directors to agree with him.\nHe should then feel\nfree to make his views known to the absentee owners.\nDirectors\nseldom do that, of course.\nThe temperament of many directors would\nin fact be incompatible with critical behavior of that sort.\nBut I\nsee nothing improper in such actions, assuming the issues are\nserious.\nNaturally, the complaining director can expect a vigorous\nrebuttal from the unpersuaded directors, a prospect that should\ndiscourage the dissenter from pursuing trivial or non-rational\ncauses.\nFor the boards just discussed, I believe the directors ought\nto be relatively few in number - say, ten or less - and ought to\ncome mostly from the outside.\nThe outside board members should\nestablish standards for the CEO's performance and should also\nperiodically meet, without his being present, to evaluate his\nperformance against those standards.\nThe requisites for board membership should be business savvy,\ninterest in the job, and owner-orientation.\nToo often, directors\nare selected simply because they are prominent or add diversity to\nthe board.\nThat practice is a mistake.\nFurthermore, mistakes in\nselecting directors are particularly serious because appointments\nare so hard to undo:\nThe pleasant but vacuous director need never\nworry about job security.\nThe second case is that existing at Berkshire, where the\ncontrolling owner is also the manager.\nAt some companies, this\narrangement is facilitated by the existence of two classes of stock\nendowed with disproportionate voting power.\nIn these situations,\nit's obvious that the board does not act as an agent between owners\nand management and that the directors cannot effect change except\nthrough persuasion.\nTherefore, if the owner/manager is mediocre or\nworse - or is over-reaching - there is little a director can do\nabout it except object.\nIf the directors having no connections to\nthe owner/manager make a unified argument, it may well have some\neffect.\nMore likely it will not.\nIf change does not come, and the matter is sufficiently\nserious, the outside directors should resign.\nTheir resignation\nwill signal their doubts about management, and it will emphasize\nthat no outsider is in a position to correct the owner/manager's\nshortcomings.\nThe third governance case occurs when there is a controlling\nowner who is not involved in management.\nThis case, examples of\nwhich are Hershey Foods and Dow Jones, puts the outside directors\nin a potentially useful position.\nIf they become unhappy with\neither the competence or integrity of the manager, they can go\ndirectly to the owner (who may also be on the board) and report\ntheir dissatisfaction.\nThis situation is ideal for an outside\ndirector, since he need make his case only to a single, presumably\ninterested owner, who can forthwith effect change if the argument\nis persuasive.\nEven so, the dissatisfied director has only that\nsingle course of action.\nIf he remains unsatisfied about a\ncritical matter, he has no choice but to resign.\nLogically, the third case should be the most effective in\ninsuring first-class management.\nIn the second case the owner is\nnot going to fire himself, and in the first case, directors often\nfind it very difficult to deal with mediocrity or mild over-\nreaching.\nUnless the unhappy directors can win over a majority of\nthe board - an awkward social and logistical task, particularly if\nmanagement's behavior is merely odious, not egregious - their hands\nare effectively tied.\nIn practice, directors trapped in situations\nof this kind usually convince themselves that by staying around\nthey can do at least some good.\nMeanwhile, management proceeds\nunfettered.\nIn the third case, the owner is neither judging himself nor\nburdened with the problem of garnering a majority.\nHe can also\ninsure that outside directors are selected who will bring useful\nqualities to the board.\nThese directors, in turn, will know that\nthe good advice they give will reach the right ears, rather than\nbeing stifled by a recalcitrant management.\nIf the controlling\nowner is intelligent and self-confident, he will make decisions in\nrespect to management that are meritocratic and pro-shareholder.\nMoreover - and this is critically important - he can readily\ncorrect any mistake he makes.\nAt Berkshire we operate in the second mode now and will for as\nlong as I remain functional.\nMy health, let me add, is excellent.\nFor better or worse, you are likely to have me as an owner/manager\nfor some time.\nAfter my death, all of my stock will go to my wife, Susie,\nshould she survive me, or to a foundation if she dies before I do.\nIn neither case will taxes and bequests require the sale of\nconsequential amounts of stock.\nWhen my stock is transferred to either my wife or the\nfoundation, Berkshire will enter the third governance mode, going\nforward with a vitally interested, but non-management, owner and\nwith a management that must perform for that owner.\nIn preparation\nfor that time, Susie was elected to the board a few years ago, and\nin 1993 our son, Howard, joined the board.\nThese family members\nwill not be managers of the company in the future, but they will\nrepresent the controlling interest should anything happen to me.\nMost of our other directors are also significant owners of\nBerkshire stock, and each has a strong owner-orientation.\nAll in\nall, we're prepared for \"the truck.\"\nShareholder-Designated Contributions\nAbout 97% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshire's\n1993 shareholder-designated contributions program.\nContributions\nmade through the program were $9.4 million and 3,110 charities were\nrecipients.\nBerkshire's practice in respect to discretionary philanthropy\n- as contrasted to its policies regarding contributions that are\nclearly related to the company's business activities - differs\nsignificantly from that of other publicly-held corporations.\nThere, most corporate contributions are made pursuant to the wishes\nof the CEO (who often will be responding to social pressures),\nemployees (through matching gifts), or directors (through matching\ngifts or requests they make of the CEO).\nAt Berkshire, we believe that the company's money is the\nowners' money, just as it would be in a closely-held corporation,\npartnership, or sole proprietorship.\nTherefore, if funds are to be\ngiven to causes unrelated to Berkshire's business activities, it is\nthe charities favored by our owners that should receive them.\nWe've yet to find a CEO who believes he should personally fund the\ncharities favored by his shareholders.\nWhy, then, should they foot\nthe bill for his picks?\nLet me add that our program is easy to administer.\nLast fall,\nfor two months, we borrowed one person from National Indemnity to\nhelp us implement the instructions that came from our 7,500\nregistered shareholders.\nI'd guess that the average corporate\nprogram in which employee gifts are matched incurs far greater\nadministrative costs.\nIndeed, our entire corporate overhead is\nless than half the size of our charitable contributions.\n(Charlie,\nhowever, insists that I tell you that $1.4 million of our $4.9 million overhead is\nattributable to our corporate jet, The Indefensible.)\nBelow is a list showing the largest categories to which our\nshareholders have steered their contributions.\n(a) 347 churches and synagogues received 569 gifts\n(b) 283 colleges and universities received 670 gifts\n(c) 244 K-12 schools (about two-thirds secular, one-\nthird religious) received 525 gifts\n(d) 288 institutions dedicated to art, culture or the\nhumanities received 447 gifts\n(e) 180 religious social-service organizations (split\nabout equally between Christian and Jewish) received\n411 gifts\n(f) 445 secular social-service organizations (about 40%\nyouth-related) received 759 gifts\n(g) 153 hospitals received 261 gifts\n(h) 186 health-related organizations (American Heart\nAssociation, American Cancer Society, etc.) received\n320 gifts\nThree things about this list seem particularly interesting to\nme.\nFirst, to some degree it indicates what people choose to give\nmoney to when they are acting of their own accord, free of pressure\nfrom solicitors or emotional appeals from charities.\nSecond, the\ncontributions programs of publicly-held companies almost never\nallow gifts to churches and synagogues, yet clearly these\ninstitutions are what many shareholders would like to support.\nThird, the gifts made by our shareholders display conflicting\nphilosophies:\n130 gifts were directed to organizations that\nbelieve in making abortions readily available for women and 30\ngifts were directed to organizations (other than churches) that\ndiscourage or are opposed to abortion.\nLast year I told you that I was thinking of raising the amount\nthat Berkshire shareholders can give under our designated-\ncontributions program and asked for your comments.\nWe received a\nfew well-written letters opposing the entire idea, on the grounds\nthat it was our job to run the business and not our job to force\nshareholders into making charitable gifts.\nMost of the\nshareholders responding, however, noted the tax efficiency of the\nplan and urged us to increase the designated amount.\nSeveral\nshareholders who have given stock to their children or\ngrandchildren told me that they consider the program a particularly\ngood way to get youngsters thinking at an early age about the\nsubject of giving.\nThese people, in other words, perceive the\nprogram to be an educational, as well as philanthropic, tool.\nThe\nbottom line is that we did raise the amount in 1993, from $8 per\nshare to $10.\nIn addition to the shareholder-designated contributions that\nBerkshire distributes, our operating businesses make contributions,\nincluding merchandise, averaging about $2.5 million annually.\nThese contributions support local charities, such as The United\nWay, and produce roughly commensurate benefits for our businesses.\nWe suggest that new shareholders read the description of our\nshareholder-designated contributions program that appears on pages\n50-51.\nTo participate in future programs, you must make sure your\nshares are registered in the name of the actual owner, not in the\nnominee name of a broker, bank or depository.\nShares not so\nregistered on August 31, 1994 will be ineligible for the 1994\nprogram.\nA Few Personal Items\nMrs. B - Rose Blumkin - had her 100th birthday on December 3,\n1993.\n(The candles cost more than the cake.)\nThat was a day on\nwhich the store was scheduled to be open in the evening.\nMrs. B,\nwho works seven days a week, for however many hours the store\noperates, found the proper decision quite obvious:\nShe simply\npostponed her party until an evening when the store was closed.\nMrs. B's story is well-known but worth telling again.\nShe\ncame to the United States 77 years ago, unable to speak English and\ndevoid of formal schooling.\nIn 1937, she founded the Nebraska\nFurniture Mart with $500.\nLast year the store had sales of $200\nmillion, a larger amount by far than that recorded by any other\nhome furnishings store in the United States.\nOur part in all of\nthis began ten years ago when Mrs. B sold control of the business\nto Berkshire Hathaway, a deal we completed without obtaining\naudited financial statements, checking real estate records, or\ngetting any warranties.\nIn short, her word was good enough for us.\nNaturally, I was delighted to attend Mrs. B's birthday party.\nAfter all, she's promised to attend my 100th.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nKatharine Graham retired last year as the chairman of The\nWashington Post Company, having relinquished the CEO title three\nyears ago.\nIn 1973, we purchased our stock in her company for\nabout $10 million.\nOur holding now garners $7 million a year in\ndividends and is worth over $400 million.\nAt the time of our\npurchase, we knew that the economic prospects of the company were\ngood.\nBut equally important, Charlie and I concluded that Kay\nwould prove to be an outstanding manager and would treat all\nshareholders honorably.\nThat latter consideration was particularly\nimportant because The Washington Post Company has two classes of\nstock, a structure that we've seen some managers abuse.\nAll of our judgments about this investment have been validated\nby events.\nKay's skills as a manager were underscored this past\nyear when she was elected by Fortune's Board of Editors to the\nBusiness Hall of Fame.\nOn behalf of our shareholders, Charlie and\nI had long ago put her in Berkshire's Hall of Fame.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAnother of last year's retirees was Don Keough of Coca-Cola,\nalthough, as he puts it, his retirement lasted \"about 14 hours.\"\nDon is one of the most extraordinary human beings I've ever known -\na man of enormous business talent, but, even more important, a man\nwho brings out the absolute best in everyone lucky enough to\nassociate with him.\nCoca-Cola wants its product to be present at\nthe happy times of a person's life.\nDon Keough, as an individual,\ninvariably increases the happiness of those around him.\nIt's\nimpossible to think about Don without feeling good.\nI will edge up to how I met Don by slipping in a plug for my\nneighborhood in Omaha:\nThough Charlie has lived in California for\n45 years, his home as a boy was about 200 feet away from the house\nwhere I now live; my wife, Susie, grew up 1 1/2 blocks away; and we\nhave about 125 Berkshire shareholders in the zip code.\nAs for Don,\nin 1958 he bought the house directly across the street from mine.\nHe was then a coffee salesman with a big family and a small income.\nThe impressions I formed in those days about Don were a factor\nin my decision to have Berkshire make a record $1 billion\ninvestment in Coca-Cola in 1988-89.\nRoberto Goizueta had become\nCEO of Coke in 1981, with Don alongside as his partner.\nThe two of\nthem took hold of a company that had stagnated during the previous\ndecade and moved it from $4.4 billion of market value to $58\nbillion in less than 13 years.\nWhat a difference a pair of\nmanagers like this makes, even when their product has been around\nfor 100 years.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nFrank Rooney did double duty last year.\nIn addition to\nleading H. H. Brown to record profits - 35% above the 1992 high -\nhe also was key to our merger with Dexter.\nFrank has known Harold Alfond and Peter Lunder for decades,\nand shortly after our purchase of H. H. Brown, told me what a\nwonderful operation they managed.\nHe encouraged us to get together\nand in due course we made a deal.\nFrank told Harold and Peter that\nBerkshire would provide an ideal corporate \"home\" for Dexter, and\nthat assurance undoubtedly contributed to their decision to join\nwith us.\nI've told you in the past of Frank's extraordinary record in\nbuilding Melville Corp. during his 23 year tenure as CEO.\nNow, at\n72, he's setting an even faster pace at Berkshire.\nFrank has a\nlow-key, relaxed style, but don't let that fool you.\nWhen he\nswings, the ball disappears far over the fence.\nThe Annual Meeting\nThis year the Annual Meeting will be held at the Orpheum\nTheater in downtown Omaha at 9:30 a.m. on Monday, April 25, 1994.\nA record 2,200 people turned up for the meeting last year, but the\ntheater can handle many more.\nWe will have a display in the lobby\nfeaturing many of our consumer products - candy, spray guns, shoes,\ncutlery, encyclopedias, and the like.\nAmong my favorites slated to\nbe there is a See's candy assortment that commemorates Mrs. B's\n100th birthday and that features her picture, rather than Mrs.\nSee's, on the package.\nWe recommend that you promptly get hotel reservations at one\nof these hotels: (1) The Radisson-Redick Tower, a small (88 rooms)\nbut nice hotel across the street from the Orpheum; (2) the much\nlarger Red Lion Hotel, located about a five-minute walk from the\nOrpheum; or (3) the Marriott, located in West Omaha about 100 yards\nfrom Borsheim's, which is a twenty-minute drive from downtown. We\nwill have buses at the Marriott that will leave at 8:30 and 8:45\nfor the meeting and return after it ends.\nAn attachment to our proxy material explains how you can\nobtain the card you will need for admission to the meeting.\nWith\nthe admission card, we will enclose information about parking\nfacilities located near the Orpheum.\nIf you are driving, come a\nlittle early.\nNearby lots fill up quickly and you may have to walk\na few blocks.\nAs usual, we will have buses to take you to Nebraska Furniture\nMart and Borsheim's after the meeting and to take you from there to\ndowntown hotels or the airport later.\nThose of you arriving early\ncan visit the Furniture Mart any day of the week; it is open from\n10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays and from noon to 5:30 p.m. on\nSundays.\nBorsheim's normally is closed on Sunday but will be open\nfor shareholders and their guests from noon to 6 p.m. on Sunday,\nApril 24.\nIn past trips to Borsheim's, many of you have met Susan\nJacques.\nEarly in 1994, Susan was made President and CEO of the\ncompany, having risen in 11 years from a $4-an-hour job that she\ntook at the store when she was 23.\nSusan will be joined at\nBorsheim's on Sunday by many of the managers of our other\nbusinesses, and Charlie and I will be there as well.\nOn the previous evening, Saturday, April 23, there will be a\nbaseball game at Rosenblatt Stadium between the Omaha Royals and\nthe Nashville Sounds (which could turn out to be Michael Jordan's\nteam).\nAs you may know, a few years ago I bought 25% of the Royals\n(a capital-allocation decision for which I will not become famous)\nand this year the league has cooperatively scheduled a home stand\nat Annual Meeting time.\nI will throw the first pitch on the 23rd, and it's a certainty\nthat I will improve on last year's humiliating performance.\nOn\nthat occasion, the catcher inexplicably called for my \"sinker\" and\nI dutifully delivered a pitch that barely missed my foot.\nThis\nyear, I will go with my high hard one regardless of what the\ncatcher signals, so bring your speed-timing devices.\nThe proxy\nstatement will include information about obtaining tickets to the\ngame.\nI regret to report that you won't have to buy them from\nscalpers.\nWarren E.

    "text": "Chairman's Letter - 1994\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOur gain in net worth during 1994 was $1.45 billion or 13.9%.\nOver the last 30 years (that is, since present management took\nover) our per-share book value has grown from $19 to $10,083, or\nat a rate of 23% compounded annually.\nCharlie Munger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman and my partner,\nand I make few predictions.\nOne we will confidently offer,\nhowever, is that the future performance of Berkshire won't come\nclose to matching the performance of the past.\nThe problem is not that what has worked in the past will\ncease to work in the future.\nTo the contrary, we believe that\nour formula - the purchase at sensible prices of businesses that\nhave good underlying economics and are run by honest and able\npeople - is certain to produce reasonable success.\nWe expect,\ntherefore, to keep on doing well.\nA fat wallet, however, is the enemy of superior investment\nresults.\nAnd Berkshire now has a net worth of $11.9 billion\ncompared to about $22 million when Charlie and I began to manage\nthe company.\nThough there are as many good businesses as ever,\nit is useless for us to make purchases that are inconsequential\nin relation to Berkshire's capital.\n(As Charlie regularly\nreminds me, \"If something is not worth doing at all, it's not\nworth doing well.\")\nWe now consider a security for purchase only\nif we believe we can deploy at least $100 million in it.\nGiven\nthat minimum, Berkshire's investment universe has shrunk\ndramatically.\nNevertheless, we will stick with the approach that got us\nhere and try not to relax our standards.\nTed Williams, in\nThe Story of My Life, explains why:\n\"My argument is, to be\na good hitter, you've got to get a good ball to hit.\nIt's the\nfirst rule in the book.\nIf I have to bite at stuff that is out\nof my happy zone, I'm not a .344 hitter.\nI might only be a .250\nhitter.\"\nCharlie and I agree and will try to wait for\nopportunities that are well within our own \"happy zone.\"\nWe will continue to ignore political and economic forecasts,\nwhich are an expensive distraction for many investors and\nbusinessmen.\nThirty years ago, no one could have foreseen the\nhuge expansion of the Vietnam War, wage and price controls, two\noil shocks, the resignation of a president, the dissolution of\nthe Soviet Union, a one-day drop in the Dow of 508 points, or\ntreasury bill yields fluctuating between 2.8% and 17.4%.\nBut, surprise - none of these blockbuster events made the\nslightest dent in Ben Graham's investment principles.\nNor did\nthey render unsound the negotiated purchases of fine businesses\nat sensible prices.\nImagine the cost to us, then, if we had let\na fear of unknowns cause us to defer or alter the deployment of\ncapital.\nIndeed, we have usually made our best purchases when\napprehensions about some macro event were at a peak.\nFear is the\nfoe of the faddist, but the friend of the fundamentalist.\nA different set of major shocks is sure to occur in the next\n30 years.\nWe will neither try to predict these nor to profit\nfrom them.\nIf we can identify businesses similar to those we\nhave purchased in the past, external surprises will have little\neffect on our long-term results.\nWhat we promise you - along with more modest gains - is that\nduring your ownership of Berkshire, you will fare just as Charlie\nand I do.\nIf you suffer, we will suffer; if we prosper, so will\nyou.\nAnd we will not break this bond by introducing compensation\narrangements that give us a greater participation in the upside\nthan the downside.\nWe further promise you that our personal fortunes will\nremain overwhelmingly concentrated in Berkshire shares:\nWe will\nnot ask you to invest with us and then put our own money\nelsewhere.\nIn addition, Berkshire dominates both the investment\nportfolios of most members of our families and of a great many\nfriends who belonged to partnerships that Charlie and I ran in\nthe 1960's.\nWe could not be more motivated to do our best.\nLuckily, we have a good base from which to work.\nTen years\nago, in 1984, Berkshire's insurance companies held securities\nhaving a value of $1.7 billion, or about $1,500 per Berkshire\nshare.\nLeaving aside all income and capital gains from those\nsecurities, Berkshire's pre-tax earnings that year were only\nabout $6 million.\nWe had earnings, yes, from our various\nmanufacturing, retailing and service businesses, but they were\nalmost entirely offset by the combination of underwriting losses\nin our insurance business, corporate overhead and interest\nexpense.\nNow we hold securities worth $18 billion, or over $15,000\nper Berkshire share.\nIf you again exclude all income from these\nsecurities, our pre-tax earnings in 1994 were about $384 million.\nDuring the decade, employment has grown from 5,000 to 22,000\n(including eleven people at World Headquarters).\nWe achieved our gains through the efforts of a superb corps\nof operating managers who get extraordinary results from some\nordinary-appearing businesses.\nCasey Stengel described managing\na baseball team as \"getting paid for home runs other fellows\nhit.\"\nThat's my formula at Berkshire, also.\nThe businesses in which we have partial interests are\nequally important to Berkshire's success.\nA few statistics will\nillustrate their significance:\nIn 1994, Coca-Cola sold about 280\nbillion 8-ounce servings and earned a little less than a penny on\neach.\nBut pennies add up.\nThrough Berkshire's 7.8% ownership of\nCoke, we have an economic interest in 21 billion of its servings,\nwhich produce \"soft-drink earnings\" for us of nearly $200\nmillion.\nSimilarly, by way of its Gillette stock, Berkshire has\na 7% share of the world's razor and blade market (measured by\nrevenues, not by units), a proportion according us about $250\nmillion of sales in 1994.\nAnd, at Wells Fargo, a $53 billion\nbank, our 13% ownership translates into a $7 billion \"Berkshire\nBank\" that earned about $100 million during 1994.\nIt's far better to own a significant portion of the Hope\ndiamond than 100% of a rhinestone, and the companies just\nmentioned easily qualify as rare gems.\nBest of all, we aren't\nlimited to simply a few of this breed, but instead possess a\ngrowing collection.\nStock prices will continue to fluctuate - sometimes sharply\n- and the economy will have its ups and down.\nOver time,\nhowever, we believe it highly probable that the sort of\nbusinesses we own will continue to increase in value at a\nsatisfactory rate.\nBook Value and Intrinsic Value\nWe regularly report our per-share book value, an easily\ncalculable number, though one of limited use.\nJust as regularly,\nwe tell you that what counts is intrinsic value, a number that is\nimpossible to pinpoint but essential to estimate.\nFor example, in 1964, we could state with certitude that\nBerkshire's per-share book value was $19.46.\nHowever, that\nfigure considerably overstated the stock's intrinsic value since\nall of the company's resources were tied up in a sub-profitable\ntextile business.\nOur textile assets had neither going-concern\nnor liquidation values equal to their carrying values.\nIn 1964,\nthen, anyone inquiring into the soundness of Berkshire's balance\nsheet might well have deserved the answer once offered up by a\nHollywood mogul of dubious reputation:\n\"Don't worry, the\nliabilities are solid.\"\nToday, Berkshire's situation has reversed:\nMany of the\nbusinesses we control are worth far more than their carrying\nvalue.\n(Those we don't control, such as Coca-Cola or Gillette,\nare carried at current market values.)\nWe continue to give you\nbook value figures, however, because they serve as a rough,\nalbeit significantly understated, tracking measure for Berkshire's\nintrinsic value.\nLast year, in fact, the two measures moved in\nconcert:\nBook value gained 13.9%, and that was the approximate\ngain in intrinsic value also.\nWe define intrinsic value as the discounted value of the\ncash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining\nlife.\nAnyone calculating intrinsic value necessarily comes up\nwith a highly subjective figure that will change both as\nestimates of future cash flows are revised and as interest rates\nmove.\nDespite its fuzziness, however, intrinsic value is all-\nimportant and is the only logical way to evaluate the relative\nattractiveness of investments and businesses.\nTo see how historical input (book value) and future output\n(intrinsic value) can diverge, let's look at another form of\ninvestment, a college education.\nThink of the education's cost\nas its \"book value.\"\nIf it is to be accurate, the cost should\ninclude the earnings that were foregone by the student because he\nchose college rather than a job.\nFor this exercise, we will ignore the important non-economic\nbenefits of an education and focus strictly on its economic\nvalue.\nFirst, we must estimate the earnings that the graduate\nwill receive over his lifetime and subtract from that figure an\nestimate of what he would have earned had he lacked his\neducation.\nThat gives us an excess earnings figure, which must\nthen be discounted, at an appropriate interest rate, back to\ngraduation day.\nThe dollar result equals the intrinsic economic\nvalue of the education.\nSome graduates will find that the book value of their\neducation exceeds its intrinsic value, which means that whoever\npaid for the education didn't get his money's worth.\nIn other\ncases, the intrinsic value of an education will far exceed its\nbook value, a result that proves capital was wisely deployed.\nIn\nall cases, what is clear is that book value is meaningless as an\nindicator of intrinsic value.\nNow let's get less academic and look at Scott Fetzer, an\nexample from Berkshire's own experience.\nThis account will not\nonly illustrate how the relationship of book value and intrinsic\nvalue can change but also will provide an accounting lesson that\nI know you have been breathlessly awaiting.\nNaturally, I've\nchosen here to talk about an acquisition that has turned out to\nbe a huge winner.\nBerkshire purchased Scott Fetzer at the beginning of 1986.\nAt the time, the company was a collection of 22 businesses, and\ntoday we have exactly the same line-up - no additions and no\ndisposals.\nScott Fetzer's main operations are World Book, Kirby,\nand Campbell Hausfeld, but many other units are important\ncontributors to earnings as well.\nWe paid $315.2 million for Scott Fetzer, which at the time\nhad $172.6 million of book value.\nThe $142.6 million premium we\nhanded over indicated our belief that the company's intrinsic\nvalue was close to double its book value.\nIn the table below we trace the book value of Scott Fetzer,\nas well as its earnings and dividends, since our purchase.\n(1)\n(4)\nBeginning\n(2)\n(3)\nEnding\nYear\nBook Value\nEarnings\nDividends\nBook Value\n----\n----------\n--------\n---------\n----------\n(In $ Millions)\n(1)+(2)-(3)\n1986 ...............\n$172.6\n$ 40.3\n$125.0\n$ 87.9\n1987 ...............\n87.9\n48.6\n41.0\n95.5\n1988 ...............\n95.5\n58.0\n35.0\n118.6\n1989 ...............\n118.6\n58.5\n71.5\n105.5\n1990 ...............\n105.5\n61.3\n33.5\n133.3\n1991 ...............\n133.3\n61.4\n74.0\n120.7\n1992 ...............\n120.7\n70.5\n80.0\n111.2\n1993 ...............\n111.2\n77.5\n98.0\n90.7\n1994 ...............\n90.7\n79.3\n76.0\n94.0\nBecause it had excess cash when our deal was made, Scott\nFetzer was able to pay Berkshire dividends of $125 million in\n1986, though it earned only $40.3 million.\nI should mention that\nwe have not introduced leverage into Scott Fetzer's balance\nsheet.\nIn fact, the company has gone from very modest debt when\nwe purchased it to virtually no debt at all (except for debt used\nby its finance subsidiary).\nSimilarly, we have not sold plants\nand leased them back, nor sold receivables, nor the like.\nThroughout our years of ownership, Scott Fetzer has operated as a\nconservatively-financed and liquid enterprise.\nAs you can see, Scott Fetzer's earnings have increased\nsteadily since we bought it, but book value has not grown\ncommensurately.\nConsequently, return on equity, which was\nexceptional at the time of our purchase, has now become truly\nextraordinary.\nJust how extraordinary is illustrated by\ncomparing Scott Fetzer's performance to that of the Fortune 500,\na group it would qualify for if it were a stand-alone company.\nHad Scott Fetzer been on the 1993 500 list - the latest\navailable for inspection - the company's return on equity would\nhave ranked 4th.\nBut that is far from the whole story.\nThe top\nthree companies in return on equity were Insilco, LTV and Gaylord\nContainer, each of which emerged from bankruptcy in 1993 and none\nof which achieved meaningful earnings that year except for those\nthey realized when they were accorded debt forgiveness in\nbankruptcy proceedings.\nLeaving aside such non-operating\nwindfalls, Scott Fetzer's return on equity would have ranked it\nfirst on the Fortune 500, well ahead of number two.\nIndeed,\nScott Fetzer's return on equity was double that of the company\nranking tenth.\nYou might expect that Scott Fetzer's success could only be\nexplained by a cyclical peak in earnings, a monopolistic\nposition, or leverage.\nBut no such circumstances apply.\nRather,\nthe company's success comes from the managerial expertise of CEO\nRalph Schey, of whom I'll tell you more later.\nFirst, however, the promised accounting lesson:\nWhen we\npaid a $142.6 million premium over book value for Scott Fetzer,\nthat figure had to be recorded on Berkshire's balance sheet.\nI'll spare you the details of how this worked (these were laid\nout in an appendix to our 1986 Annual Report) and get to the\nbottom line:\nAfter a premium is initially recorded, it must in\nalmost all cases be written off over time through annual charges\nthat are shown as costs in the acquiring company's earnings\nstatement.\nThe following table shows, first, the annual charges\nBerkshire has made to gradually extinguish the Scott Fetzer\nacquisition premium and, second, the premium that remains on our\nbooks.\nThese charges have no effect on cash or the taxes we pay,\nand are not, in our view, an economic cost (though many\naccountants would disagree with us).\nThey are merely a way for\nus to reduce the carrying value of Scott Fetzer on our books so\nthat the figure will eventually match the net worth that Scott\nFetzer actually employs in its business.\nBeginning\nPurchase-Premium\nEnding\nPurchase\nCharge to\nPurchase\nYear\nPremium\nBerkshire Earnings\nPremium\n----\n---------\n------------------\n--------\n(In $ Millions)\n1986 ................\n$142.6\n$ 11.6\n$131.0\n1987 ................\n131.0\n7.1\n123.9\n1988 ................\n123.9\n7.9\n115.9\n1989 ................\n115.9\n7.0\n108.9\n1990 ................\n108.9\n7.1\n101.9\n1991 ................\n101.9\n6.9\n95.0\n1992 ................\n95.0\n7.7\n87.2\n1993 ................\n87.2\n28.1\n59.1\n1994 ................\n59.1\n4.9\n54.2\nNote that by the end of 1994 the premium was reduced to\n$54.2 million.\nWhen this figure is added to Scott Fetzer's year-\nend book value of $94 million, the total is $148.2 million, which\nis the current carrying value of Scott Fetzer on Berkshire's\nbooks.\nThat amount is less than half of our carrying value for\nthe company when it was acquired.\nYet Scott Fetzer is now\nearning about twice what it then did.\nClearly, the intrinsic\nvalue of the business has consistently grown, even though we have\njust as consistently marked down its carrying value through\npurchase-premium charges that reduced Berkshire's earnings and\nnet worth.\nThe difference between Scott Fetzer's intrinsic value and\nits carrying value on Berkshire's books is now huge.\nAs I\nmentioned earlier - but am delighted to mention again - credit\nfor this agreeable mismatch goes to Ralph Schey, a focused, smart\nand high-grade manager.\nThe reasons for Ralph's success are not complicated.\nBen\nGraham taught me 45 years ago that in investing it is not\nnecessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary\nresults.\nIn later life, I have been surprised to find that this\nstatement holds true in business management as well.\nWhat a\nmanager must do is handle the basics well and not get diverted.\nThat's precisely Ralph's formula.\nHe establishes the right goals\nand never forgets what he set out to do.\nOn the personal side,\nRalph is a joy to work with.\nHe's forthright about problems and\nis self-confident without being self-important.\nHe is also experienced.\nThough I don't know Ralph's age, I\ndo know that, like many of our managers, he is over 65.\nAt\nBerkshire, we look to performance, not to the calendar.\nCharlie\nand I, at 71 and 64 respectively, now keep George Foreman's\npicture on our desks.\nYou can make book that our scorn for a\nmandatory retirement age will grow stronger every year.\nIntrinsic Value and Capital Allocation\nUnderstanding intrinsic value is as important for managers\nas it is for investors.\nWhen managers are making capital\nallocation decisions - including decisions to repurchase shares -\nit's vital that they act in ways that increase per-share\nintrinsic value and avoid moves that decrease it.\nThis principle\nmay seem obvious but we constantly see it violated.\nAnd, when\nmisallocations occur, shareholders are hurt.\nFor example, in contemplating business mergers and\nacquisitions, many managers tend to focus on whether the\ntransaction is immediately dilutive or anti-dilutive to earnings\nper share (or, at financial institutions, to per-share book\nvalue).\nAn emphasis of this sort carries great dangers.\nGoing\nback to our college-education example, imagine that a 25-year-old\nfirst-year MBA student is considering merging his future economic\ninterests with those of a 25-year-old day laborer.\nThe MBA\nstudent, a non-earner, would find that a \"share-for-share\" merger\nof his equity interest in himself with that of the day laborer\nwould enhance his near-term earnings (in a big way!).\nBut what\ncould be sillier for the student than a deal of this kind?\nIn corporate transactions, it's equally silly for the would-\nbe purchaser to focus on current earnings when the prospective\nacquiree has either different prospects, different amounts of\nnon-operating assets, or a different capital structure.\nAt\nBerkshire, we have rejected many merger and purchase\nopportunities that would have boosted current and near-term\nearnings but that would have reduced per-share intrinsic value.\nOur approach, rather, has been to follow Wayne Gretzky's advice:\n\"Go to where the puck is going to be, not to where it is.\"\nAs a\nresult, our shareholders are now many billions of dollars richer\nthan they would have been if we had used the standard catechism.\nThe sad fact is that most major acquisitions display an\negregious imbalance:\nThey are a bonanza for the shareholders of\nthe acquiree; they increase the income and status of the\nacquirer's management; and they are a honey pot for the\ninvestment bankers and other professionals on both sides.\nBut,\nalas, they usually reduce the wealth of the acquirer's shareholders,\noften to a substantial extent.\nThat happens because the acquirer\ntypically gives up more intrinsic value than it receives.\nDo that\nenough, says John Medlin, the retired head of Wachovia Corp., and\n\"you are running a chain letter in reverse.\"\nOver time, the skill with which a company's managers\nallocate capital has an enormous impact on the enterprise's\nvalue.\nAlmost by definition, a really good business generates\nfar more money (at least after its early years) than it can use\ninternally.\nThe company could, of course, distribute the money\nto shareholders by way of dividends or share repurchases.\nBut\noften the CEO asks a strategic planning staff, consultants or\ninvestment bankers whether an acquisition or two might make\nsense.\nThat's like asking your interior decorator whether you\nneed a $50,000 rug.\nThe acquisition problem is often compounded by a biological\nbias:\nMany CEO's attain their positions in part because they\npossess an abundance of animal spirits and ego.\nIf an executive\nis heavily endowed with these qualities - which, it should be\nacknowledged, sometimes have their advantages - they won't\ndisappear when he reaches the top.\nWhen such a CEO is encouraged\nby his advisors to make deals, he responds much as would a\nteenage boy who is encouraged by his father to have a normal sex\nlife.\nIt's not a push he needs.\nSome years back, a CEO friend of mine - in jest, it must be\nsaid - unintentionally described the pathology of many big deals.\nThis friend, who ran a property-casualty insurer, was explaining\nto his directors why he wanted to acquire a certain life\ninsurance company.\nAfter droning rather unpersuasively through\nthe economics and strategic rationale for the acquisition, he\nabruptly abandoned the script.\nWith an impish look, he simply\nsaid:\n\"Aw, fellas, all the other kids have one.\"\nAt Berkshire, our managers will continue to earn\nextraordinary returns from what appear to be ordinary businesses.\nAs a first step, these managers will look for ways to deploy\ntheir earnings advantageously in their businesses.\nWhat's left,\nthey will send to Charlie and me.\nWe then will try to use those\nfunds in ways that build per-share intrinsic value.\nOur goal\nwill be to acquire either part or all of businesses that we\nbelieve we understand, that have good, sustainable underlying\neconomics, and that are run by managers whom we like, admire and\ntrust.\nCompensation\nAt Berkshire, we try to be as logical about compensation as\nabout capital allocation.\nFor example, we compensate Ralph Schey\nbased upon the results of Scott Fetzer rather than those of\nBerkshire.\nWhat could make more sense, since he's responsible\nfor one operation but not the other?\nA cash bonus or a stock\noption tied to the fortunes of Berkshire would provide totally\ncapricious rewards to Ralph.\nHe could, for example, be hitting\nhome runs at Scott Fetzer while Charlie and I rang up mistakes at\nBerkshire, thereby negating his efforts many times over.\nConversely, why should option profits or bonuses be heaped upon\nRalph if good things are occurring in other parts of Berkshire\nbut Scott Fetzer is lagging?\nIn setting compensation, we like to hold out the promise of\nlarge carrots, but make sure their delivery is tied directly to\nresults in the area that a manager controls.\nWhen capital\ninvested in an operation is significant, we also both charge\nmanagers a high rate for incremental capital they employ and\ncredit them at an equally high rate for capital they release.\nThe product of this money's-not-free approach is definitely\nvisible at Scott Fetzer.\nIf Ralph can employ incremental funds\nat good returns, it pays him to do so:\nHis bonus increases when\nearnings on additional capital exceed a meaningful hurdle charge.\nBut our bonus calculation is symmetrical:\nIf incremental\ninvestment yields sub-standard returns, the shortfall is costly\nto Ralph as well as to Berkshire.\nThe consequence of this two-\nway arrangement is that it pays Ralph - and pays him well - to\nsend to Omaha any cash he can't advantageously use in his\nbusiness.\nIt has become fashionable at public companies to describe\nalmost every compensation plan as aligning the interests of\nmanagement with those of shareholders.\nIn our book, alignment\nmeans being a partner in both directions, not just on the upside.\nMany \"alignment\" plans flunk this basic test, being artful forms\nof \"heads I win, tails you lose.\"\nA common form of misalignment occurs in the typical stock\noption arrangement, which does not periodically increase the\noption price to compensate for the fact that retained earnings\nare building up the wealth of the company.\nIndeed, the\ncombination of a ten-year option, a low dividend payout, and\ncompound interest can provide lush gains to a manager who has\ndone no more than tread water in his job.\nA cynic might even\nnote that when payments to owners are held down, the profit to\nthe option-holding manager increases.\nI have yet to see this\nvital point spelled out in a proxy statement asking shareholders\nto approve an option plan.\nI can't resist mentioning that our compensation arrangement\nwith Ralph Schey was worked out in about five minutes,\nimmediately upon our purchase of Scott Fetzer and without the\n\"help\" of lawyers or compensation consultants.\nThis arrangement\nembodies a few very simple ideas - not the kind of terms favored\nby consultants who cannot easily send a large bill unless they\nhave established that you have a large problem (and one, of\ncourse, that requires an annual review).\nOur agreement with\nRalph has never been changed.\nIt made sense to him and to me in\n1986, and it makes sense now.\nOur compensation arrangements with\nthe managers of all our other units are similarly simple, though\nthe terms of each agreement vary to fit the economic\ncharacteristics of the business at issue, the existence in some\ncases of partial ownership of the unit by managers, etc.\nIn all instances, we pursue rationality.\nArrangements that\npay off in capricious ways, unrelated to a manager's personal\naccomplishments, may well be welcomed by certain managers.\nWho,\nafter all, refuses a free lottery ticket?\nBut such arrangements\nare wasteful to the company and cause the manager to lose focus\non what should be his real areas of concern.\nAdditionally,\nirrational behavior at the parent may well encourage imitative\nbehavior at subsidiaries.\nAt Berkshire, only Charlie and I have the managerial\nresponsibility for the entire business.\nTherefore, we are the\nonly parties who should logically be compensated on the basis of\nwhat the enterprise does as a whole.\nEven so, that is not a\ncompensation arrangement we desire.\nWe have carefully designed\nboth the company and our jobs so that we do things we enjoy with\npeople we like.\nEqually important, we are forced to do very few\nboring or unpleasant tasks.\nWe are the beneficiaries as well of\nthe abundant array of material and psychic perks that flow to the\nheads of corporations.\nUnder such idyllic conditions, we don't\nexpect shareholders to ante up loads of compensation for which we\nhave no possible need.\nIndeed, if we were not paid at all, Charlie and I would be\ndelighted with the cushy jobs we hold.\nAt bottom, we subscribe\nto Ronald Reagan's creed:\n\"It's probably true that hard work\nnever killed anyone, but I figure why take the chance.\"\nSources of Reported Earnings\nThe table on the next page shows the main sources of\nBerkshire's reported earnings.\nIn this presentation, purchase-\npremium charges of the type we discussed in our earlier analysis\nof Scott Fetzer are not assigned to the specific businesses to\nwhich they apply, but are instead aggregated and shown\nseparately.\nThis procedure lets you view the earnings of our\nbusinesses as they would have been reported had we not purchased\nthem.\nThis form of presentation seems to us to be more useful to\ninvestors and managers than one utilizing GAAP, which requires\npurchase premiums to be charged off, business-by-business.\nThe\ntotal earnings we show in the table are, of course, identical to\nthe GAAP total in our audited financial statements.\nBerkshire's Share\nof Net Earnings\n(after taxes and\nPre-Tax Earnings\nminority interests)\n-------------------\n-------------------\n1994\n1993\n1994\n1993\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\n(000s omitted)\nOperating Earnings:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting ...............\n$129,926\n$ 30,876\n$ 80,860\n$ 20,156\nNet Investment Income ......\n419,422\n375,946\n350,453\n321,321\nBuffalo News .................\n54,238\n50,962\n31,685\n29,696\nFechheimer ...................\n14,260\n13,442\n7,107\n6,931\nFinance Businesses ...........\n21,568\n22,695\n14,293\n14,161\nKirby ........................\n42,349\n39,147\n27,719\n25,056\nNebraska Furniture Mart ......\n17,356\n21,540\n8,652\n10,398\nScott Fetzer Manufacturing Group\n39,435\n38,196\n24,909\n23,809\nSee's Candies ................\n47,539\n41,150\n28,247\n24,367\nShoe Group ...................\n85,503\n44,025*\n55,750\n28,829\nWorld Book ...................\n24,662\n19,915\n17,275\n13,537\nPurchase-Price Premium Charges\n(22,595)\n(17,033)\n(19,355)\n(13,996)\nInterest Expense** ...........\n(60,111)\n(56,545)\n(37,264)\n(35,614)\nShareholder-Designated\nContributions .............\n(10,419)\n(9,448)\n(6,668)\n(5,994)\nOther ........................\n36,232\n28,428\n22,576\n15,094\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nOperating Earnings .............\n839,365\n643,296\n606,239\n477,751\nSales of Securities ............\n91,332\n546,422\n61,138\n356,702\nDecline in Value of\nUSAir Preferred Stock .....\n(268,500)\n---\n(172,579)\n---\nTax Accruals Caused by\nNew Accounting Rules ......\n---\n---\n---\n(146,332)\n--------\n---------\n--------\n--------\nTotal Earnings -

and that loss is the cost of float.\nAn insurance business is profitable over time if its cost of\nfloat is less than the cost the company would otherwise incur to\nobtain funds.\nBut the business has a negative value if the cost of\nits float is higher than market rates for money.\nAs the numbers in the following table show, Berkshire's\ninsurance business has been an enormous winner.\nFor the table, we\nhave compiled our float -\nwhich we generate in exceptional amounts\nrelative to our premium volume - by adding loss reserves, loss\nadjustment reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned\npremium reserves and then subtracting agents' balances, prepaid\nacquisition costs, prepaid taxes and deferred charges applicable to\nassumed reinsurance.\nOur cost of float is determined by our\nunderwriting loss or profit.\nIn those years when we have had an\nunderwriting profit, such as the last two, our cost of float has been\nnegative, and we have determined our insurance earnings by adding\nunderwriting profit to float income.\n(1)\n(2)\nYearend Yield\nUnderwriting\nApproximate\non Long-Term\nLoss\nAverage Float\nCost of Funds\nGovt.

we\nhave a fine insurance business, it is not as good as it currently\nlooks.\nThe reason we must repeat this caution is that our \"super-cat\"\nbusiness (which sells policies that insurance and reinsurance\ncompanies buy to protect themselves from the effects of mega-\ncatastrophes) was again highly profitable.\nSince truly major\ncatastrophes occur infrequently, our super-cat business can be\nexpected to show large profits in most years but occasionally to\nrecord a huge loss.\nIn other words, the attractiveness of our\nsuper-cat business will take many years to measure.\nCertainly 1994\nshould be regarded as close to a best-case.\nOur only significant\nlosses arose from the California earthquake in January.\nI will add\nthat we do not expect to suffer a major loss from the early-1995\nKobe earthquake.\nSuper-cat policies are small in number, large in size and non-\nstandardized.\nTherefore, the underwriting of this business\nrequires far more judgment than, say, the underwriting of auto\npolicies, for which a mass of data is available.\nHere Berkshire\nhas a major advantage:\nAjit Jain, our super-cat manager, whose\nunderwriting skills are the finest.\nHis value to us is simply\nenormous.\nIn addition, Berkshire has a special advantage in the super-\ncat business because of our towering financial strength, which\nhelps us in two ways.\nFirst, a prudent insurer will want its\nprotection against true mega-catastrophes - such as a $50 billion\nwindstorm loss on Long Island or an earthquake of similar cost in\nCalifornia - to be absolutely certain.\nBut that same insurer knows\nthat the disaster making it dependent on a large super-cat recovery\nis also the disaster that could cause many reinsurers to default.\nThere's not much sense in paying premiums for coverage that will\nevaporate precisely when it is needed.\nSo the certainty that\nBerkshire will be both solvent and liquid after a catastrophe of\nunthinkable proportions is a major competitive advantage for us.\nThe second benefit of our capital strength is that we can\nwrite policies for amounts that no one else can even consider.\nFor\nexample, during 1994, a primary insurer wished to buy a short-term\npolicy for $400 million of California earthquake coverage and we\nwrote the policy immediately.\nWe know of no one else in the world\nwho would take a $400 million risk, or anything close to it, for\ntheir own account.\nGenerally, brokers attempt to place coverage for large amounts\nby spreading the burden over a number of small policies.\nBut, at\nbest, coverage of that sort takes considerable time to arrange.\nIn\nthe meantime, the company desiring reinsurance is left holding a\nrisk it doesn't want and that may seriously threaten its well-\nbeing.\nAt Berkshire, on the other hand, we will quote prices for\ncoverage as great as $500 million on the same day that we are asked\nto bid.\nNo one else in the industry will do the same.\nBy writing coverages in large lumps, we obviously expose\nBerkshire to lumpy financial results.\nThat's totally acceptable to\nus:\nToo often, insurers (as well as other businesses) follow sub-\noptimum strategies in order to \"smooth\" their reported earnings.\nBy accepting the prospect of volatility, we expect to earn higher\nlong-term returns than we would by pursuing predictability.\nGiven the risks we accept, Ajit and I constantly focus on our\n\"worst case,\" knowing, of course, that it is difficult to judge\nwhat this is, since you could conceivably have a Long Island\nhurricane, a California earthquake, and Super Cat X all in the same\nyear.\nAdditionally, insurance losses could be accompanied by non-\ninsurance troubles.\nFor example, were we to have super-cat losses\nfrom a large Southern California earthquake, they might well be\naccompanied by a major drop in the value of our holdings in See's,\nWells Fargo and Freddie Mac.\nAll things considered, we believe our worst-case insurance\nloss from a super-cat is now about $600 million after-tax, an\namount that would slightly exceed Berkshire's annual earnings from\nother sources.\nIf you are not comfortable with this level of\nexposure, the time to sell your Berkshire stock is now, not after\nthe inevitable mega-catastrophe.\nOur super-cat volume will probably be down in 1995.\nPrices\nfor garden-variety policies have fallen somewhat, and the torrent\nof capital that was committed to the reinsurance business a few\nyears ago will be inclined to chase premiums, irrespective of their\nadequacy.\nNevertheless, we have strong relations with an important\ngroup of clients who will provide us with a substantial amount of\nbusiness in 1995.\nBerkshire's other insurance operations had excellent results\nin 1994.\nOur homestate operation, led by Rod Eldred; our workers'\ncompensation business, headed by Brad Kinstler; our credit card\noperation, managed by the Kizer family; National Indemnity's\ntraditional auto and general liability business, led by Don Wurster\n- all of these generated significant underwriting profits\naccompanied by substantial float.\nWe can conclude this section as we did last year:\nAll in all,\nwe have a first-class insurance business.\nThough its results will\nbe highly volatile, this operation possesses an intrinsic value\nthat exceeds its book value by a large amount - larger, in fact,\nthan is the case at any other Berkshire business.\nCommon Stock Investments\nBelow we list our common stockholdings having a value of over\n$300 million.\nA small portion of these investments belongs to\nsubsidiaries of which Berkshire owns less than 100%.\n12/31/94\nShares\nCompany\nCost\nMarket\n------\n-------\n----------\n----------\n(000s omitted)\n27,759,941\nAmerican Express Company.

investment idea can usually be explained in\na short paragraph.\nWe like a business with enduring competitive\nadvantages that is run by able and owner-oriented people.\nWhen\nthese attributes exist, and when we can make purchases at sensible\nprices, it is hard to go wrong (a challenge we periodically manage\nto overcome).\nInvestors should remember that their scorecard is not computed\nusing Olympic-diving methods:\nDegree-of-difficulty doesn't count.\nIf you are right about a business whose value is largely dependent\non a single key factor that is both easy to understand and\nenduring, the payoff is the same as if you had correctly analyzed\nan investment alternative characterized by many constantly shifting\nand complex variables.\nWe try to price, rather than time, purchases.\nIn our view, it\nis folly to forego buying shares in an outstanding business whose\nlong-term future is predictable, because of short-term worries\nabout an economy or a stock market that we know to be\nunpredictable.\nWhy scrap an informed decision because of an\nuninformed guess?\nWe purchased National Indemnity in 1967, See's in 1972,\nBuffalo News in 1977, Nebraska Furniture Mart in 1983, and Scott\nFetzer in 1986 because those are the years they became available\nand because we thought the prices they carried were acceptable.\nIn\neach case, we pondered what the business was likely to do, not what\nthe Dow, the Fed, or the economy might do.\nIf we see this approach\nas making sense in the purchase of businesses in their entirety,\nwhy should we change tack when we are purchasing small pieces of\nwonderful businesses in the stock market?\nBefore looking at new investments, we consider adding to old\nones.\nIf a business is attractive enough to buy once, it may well\npay to repeat the process.\nWe would love to increase our economic\ninterest in See's or Scott Fetzer, but we haven't found a way to\nadd to a 100% holding.\nIn the stock market, however, an investor\nfrequently gets the chance to increase his economic interest in\nbusinesses he knows and likes.\nLast year we went that direction by\nenlarging our holdings in Coca-Cola and American Express.\nOur history with American Express goes way back and, in fact,\nfits the pattern of my pulling current investment decisions out of\npast associations.\nIn 1951, for example, GEICO shares comprised\n70% of my personal portfolio and GEICO was also the first stock I\nsold - I was then 20 - as a security salesman (the sale was 100\nshares to my Aunt Alice who, bless her, would have bought anything\nI suggested).\nTwenty-five years later, Berkshire purchased a major\nstake in GEICO at the time it was threatened with insolvency.\nIn\nanother instance, that of the Washington Post, about half of my\ninitial investment funds came from delivering the paper in the\n1940's.\nThree decades later Berkshire purchased a large position\nin the company two years after it went public.\nAs for Coca-Cola,\nmy first business venture - this was in the 1930's - was buying a\nsix-pack of Coke for 25 cents and selling each bottle for 5 cents.\nIt took only fifty years before I finally got it:\nThe real money\nwas in the syrup.\nMy American Express history includes a couple of episodes:\nIn\nthe mid-1960's, just after the stock was battered by the company's\ninfamous salad-oil scandal, we put about 40% of Buffett Partnership\nLtd.'s capital into the stock - the largest investment the\npartnership had ever made.\nI should add that this commitment gave\nus over 5% ownership in Amex at a cost of $13 million.\nAs I write\nthis, we own just under 10%, which has cost us $1.36 billion.\n(Amex earned $12.5 million in 1964 and $1.4 billion in 1994.)\nMy history with Amex's IDS unit, which today contributes about\na third of the earnings of the company, goes back even further.\nI\nfirst purchased stock in IDS in 1953 when it was growing rapidly\nand selling at a price-earnings ratio of only 3.\n(There was a lot\nof low-hanging fruit in those days.)\nI even produced a long report\n- do I ever write a short one? - on the company that I sold for $1\nthrough an ad in the Wall Street Journal.\nObviously American Express and IDS (recently renamed American\nExpress Financial Advisors) are far different operations today from\nwhat they were then.\nNevertheless, I find that a long-term\nfamiliarity with a company and its products is often helpful in\nevaluating it.\nMistake Du Jour\nMistakes occur at the time of decision.\nWe can only make our\nmistake-du-jour award, however, when the foolishness of the\ndecision become obvious.\nBy this measure, 1994 was a vintage year\nwith keen competition for the gold medal.\nHere, I would like to\ntell you that the mistakes I will describe originated with Charlie.\nBut whenever I try to explain things that way, my nose begins to\ngrow.\nAnd the nominees are . . .\nLate in 1993 I sold 10 million shares of Cap Cities at $63; at\nyear-end 1994, the price was $85.25.\n(The difference is $222.5\nmillion for those of you who wish to avoid the pain of calculating\nthe damage yourself.)\nWhen we purchased the stock at $17.25 in\n1986, I told you that I had previously sold our Cap Cities holdings\nat $4.30 per share during 1978-80, and added that I was at a loss\nto explain my earlier behavior.\nNow I've become a repeat offender.\nMaybe it's time to get a guardian appointed.\nEgregious as it is, the Cap Cities decision earns only a\nsilver medal.\nTop honors go to a mistake I made five years ago\nthat fully ripened in 1994:\nOur $358 million purchase of USAir\npreferred stock, on which the dividend was suspended in September.\nIn the 1990 Annual Report I correctly described this deal as an\n\"unforced error,\" meaning that I was neither pushed into the\ninvestment nor misled by anyone when making it.\nRather, this was a\ncase of sloppy analysis, a lapse that may have been caused by the\nfact that we were buying a senior security or by hubris.\nWhatever\nthe reason, the mistake was large.\nBefore this purchase, I simply failed to focus on the problems\nthat would inevitably beset a carrier whose costs were both high\nand extremely difficult to lower.\nIn earlier years, these life-\nthreatening costs posed few problems.\nAirlines were then protected\nfrom competition by regulation, and carriers could absorb high\ncosts because they could pass them along by way of fares that were\nalso high.\nWhen deregulation came along, it did not immediately change\nthe picture:\nThe capacity of low-cost carriers was so small that\nthe high-cost lines could, in large part, maintain their existing\nfare structures.\nDuring this period, with the longer-term problems\nlargely invisible but slowly metastasizing, the costs that were\nnon-sustainable became further embedded.\nAs the seat capacity of the low-cost operators expanded, their\nfares began to force the old-line, high-cost airlines to cut their\nown.\nThe day of reckoning for these airlines could be delayed by\ninfusions of capital (such as ours into USAir), but eventually a\nfundamental rule of economics prevailed:\nIn an unregulated\ncommodity business, a company must lower its costs to competitive\nlevels or face extinction.\nThis principle should have been obvious\nto your Chairman, but I missed it.\nSeth Schofield, CEO of USAir, has worked diligently to correct\nthe company's historical cost problems but, to date, has not\nmanaged to do so.\nIn part, this is because he has had to deal with\na moving target, the result of certain major carriers having\nobtained labor concessions and other carriers having benefitted\nfrom \"fresh-start\" costs that came out of bankruptcy proceedings.\n(As Herb Kelleher, CEO of Southwest Airlines, has said:\n\"Bankruptcy court for airlines has become a health spa.\")\nAdditionally, it should be no surprise to anyone that those airline\nemployees who contractually receive above-market salaries will\nresist any reduction in these as long as their checks continue to\nclear.\nDespite this difficult situation, USAir may yet achieve the\ncost reductions it needs to maintain its viability\nlong-term.\nBut\nit is far from sure that will happen.\nAccordingly, we wrote our USAir investment down to $89.5\nmillion, 25 cents on the dollar at yearend 1994.\nThis valuation\nreflects both a possibility that our preferred will have its value\nfully or largely restored and an opposite possibility that the\nstock will eventually become worthless.\nWhatever the outcome, we\nwill heed a prime rule of investing:\nYou don't have to make it\nback the way that you lost it.\nThe accounting effects of our USAir writedown are complicated.\nUnder GAAP accounting, insurance companies are required to carry\nall stocks on their balance sheets at estimated market value.\nTherefore, at the end of last year's third quarter, we were\ncarrying our USAir preferred at $89.5 million, or 25% of cost.\nIn\nother words, our net worth was at that time reflecting a value for\nUSAir that was far below our $358 million cost.\nBut in the fourth quarter, we concluded that the decline in\nvalue was, in accounting terms, \"other than temporary,\" and that\njudgment required us to send the writedown of $269 million through\nour income statement.\nThe amount will have no other fourth-quarter\neffect.\nThat is, it will not reduce our net worth, because the\ndiminution of value had already been reflected.\nCharlie and I will not stand for reelection to USAir's board\nat the upcoming annual meeting.\nShould Seth wish to consult with\nus, however, we will be pleased to be of any help that we can.\nMiscellaneous\nTwo CEO's who have done great things for Berkshire\nshareholders retired last year:\nDan Burke of Capital Cities/ABC\nand Carl Reichardt of Wells Fargo.\nDan and Carl encountered very\ntough industry conditions in recent years.\nBut their skill as\nmanagers allowed the businesses they ran to emerge from these\nperiods with record earnings, added luster, and bright prospects.\nAdditionally, Dan and Carl prepared well for their departure and\nleft their companies in outstanding hands.\nWe owe them our\ngratitude.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAbout 95.7% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshire's\n1994 shareholder-designated contributions program.\nContributions\nmade through the program were $10.4 million and 3,300 charities\nwere recipients.\nEvery year a few shareholders miss participating in the\nprogram because they either do not have their shares registered in\ntheir own names on the prescribed record date or because they fail\nto get the designation form back to us within the 60-day period\nallowed for its return.\nSince we don't make exceptions when\nrequirements aren't met, we urge that both new shareholders and old\nread the description of our shareholder-designated contributions\nprogram that appears on pages 50-51.\nTo participate in future programs, you must make sure your\nshares are registered in the name of the actual owner, not in the\nnominee name of a broker, bank or depository.\nShares not so\nregistered on August 31, 1995 will be ineligible for the 1995\nprogram.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nWe made only one minor acquisition during 1994 - a small\nretail shoe chain - but our interest in finding good candidates\nremains as keen as ever.\nThe criteria we employ for purchases or\nmergers is detailed in the appendix on page 21.\nLast spring, we offered to merge with a large, family-\ncontrolled business on terms that included a Berkshire convertible\npreferred stock.\nThough we failed to reach an agreement, this\nepisode made me realize that we needed to ask our shareholders to\nauthorize preferred shares in case we wanted in the future to move\nquickly if a similar acquisition opportunity were to appear.\nAccordingly, our proxy presents a proposal that you authorize a\nlarge amount of preferred stock, which will be issuable on terms\nset by the Board of Directors.\nYou can be sure that Charlie and I\nwill not use these shares without being completely satisfied that\nwe are receiving as much in intrinsic value as we are giving.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nCharlie and I hope you can come to the Annual Meeting - at a\nnew site.\nLast year, we slightly overran the Orpheum Theater's\nseating capacity of 2,750, and therefore we will assemble at 9:30\na.m. on Monday, May 1, 1995, at the Holiday Convention Centre.\nThe\nmain ballroom at the Centre can handle 3,300, and if need be, we\nwill have audio and video equipment in an adjacent room capable of\nhandling another 1,000 people.\nLast year we displayed some of Berkshire's products at the\nmeeting, and as a result sold about 800 pounds of candy, 507 pairs\nof shoes, and over $12,000 of World Books and related publications.\nAll these goods will be available again this year.\nThough we like\nto think of the meeting as a spiritual experience, we must remember\nthat even the least secular of religions includes the ritual of the\ncollection plate.\nOf course, what you really should be purchasing is a video\ntape of the 1995 Orange Bowl.\nYour Chairman views this classic\nnightly, switching to slow motion for the fourth quarter.\nOur\ncover color this year is a salute to Nebraska's football coach, Tom\nOsborne, and his Cornhuskers, the country's top college team.\nI\nurge you to wear Husker red to the annual meeting and promise you\nthat at least 50% of your managerial duo will be in appropriate\nattire.\nWe recommend that you promptly get hotel reservations for the\nmeeting, as we expect a large crowd.\nThose of you who like to be\ndowntown (about six miles from the Centre) may wish to stay at the\nRadisson Redick Tower, a small (88 rooms) but nice hotel or at the\nmuch larger Red Lion Hotel a few blocks away.\nIn the vicinity of\nthe Centre are the Holiday Inn (403 rooms), Homewood Suites (118\nrooms) and Hampton Inn (136 rooms).\nAnother recommended spot is\nthe Marriott, whose west Omaha location is about 100 yards from\nBorsheim's and a ten-minute drive from the Centre.\nThere will be\nbuses at the Marriott that will leave at 8:45 and 9:00 for the\nmeeting and return after it ends.\nAn attachment to our proxy material explains how you can\nobtain the card you will need for admission to the meeting.\nA\ngood-sized parking area is available at the Centre, while those who\nstay at the Holiday Inn, Homewood Suites and Hampton Inn will be\nable to walk to the meeting.\nAs usual, we will have buses to take you to the Nebraska\nFurniture Mart and Borsheim's after the meeting and to take you\nfrom there to hotels or the airport later.\nI hope you make a\nspecial effort to visit the Nebraska Furniture Mart because it has\nopened the Mega Mart, a true retailing marvel that sells\nelectronics, appliances, computers, CD's, cameras and audio\nequipment.\nSales have been sensational since the opening, and you\nwill be amazed by both the variety of products available and their\ndisplay on the floor.\nThe Mega Mart, adjacent to NFM's main store, is on our 64-acre\nsite about two miles north of the Centre.\nThe stores are open from\n10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Fridays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays and\nnoon to 6 p.m. on Sundays.\nWhen you're there be sure to say hello\nto Mrs. B, who, at 101, will be hard at work in our Mrs. B's\nWarehouse.\nShe never misses a day at the store - or, for that\nmatter, an hour.\nBorsheim's normally is closed on Sunday but will be open for\nshareholders and their guests from noon to 6 p.m. on Sunday.\nThis\nis always a special day, and we will try to have a few surprises.\nUsually this is the biggest sales day of the year, so for more\nreasons than one Charlie and I hope to see you there.\nOn Saturday evening, April 29, there will be a baseball game\nat Rosenblatt Stadium between the Omaha Royals and the Buffalo\nBisons.\nThe Buffalo team is owned by my friends, Mindy and Bob\nRich, Jr., and I'm hoping they will attend.\nIf so, I will try to\nentice Bob into a one-pitch duel on the mound.\nBob is a\ncapitalist's Randy Johnson - young, strong and athletic - and not\nthe sort of fellow you want to face early in the season.\nSo I will\nneed plenty of vocal support.\nThe proxy statement will include information about obtaining\ntickets to the game.\nAbout 1,400 shareholders attended the event\nlast year.\nOpening the game that night, I had my stuff and threw a\nstrike that the scoreboard reported at eight miles per hour.\nWhat\nmany fans missed was that I shook off the catcher's call for my\nfast ball and instead delivered my change-up.\nThis year it will be\nall smoke.\nWarren E.

    "text": "Chairman's Letter - 1995\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOur gain in net worth during 1995 was $5.3 billion, or\n45.0%.\nPer-share book value grew by a little less, 43.1%,\nbecause we paid stock for two acquisitions, increasing our shares\noutstanding by 1.3%.\nOver the last 31 years (that is, since\npresent management took over) per-share book value has grown from\n$19 to $14,426, or at a rate of 23.6% compounded annually.\nThere's no reason to do handsprings over 1995's gains.\nThis\nwas a year in which any fool could make a bundle in the stock\nmarket.\nAnd we did.\nTo paraphrase President Kennedy, a rising\ntide lifts all yachts.\nPutting aside the financial results, there was plenty of\ngood news at Berkshire last year:\nWe negotiated three\nacquisitions of exactly the type we desire.\nTwo of these,\nHelzberg's Diamond Shops and R.C. Willey Home Furnishings, are\nincluded in our 1995 financial statements, while our largest\ntransaction, the purchase of GEICO, closed immediately after the\nend of the year.\n(I'll tell you more about all three\nacquisitions later in the report.)\nThese new subsidiaries roughly double our revenues.\nEven\nso, the acquisitions neither materially increased our shares\noutstanding nor our debt.\nAnd, though these three operations\nemploy over 11,000 people, our headquarters staff grew only from\n11 to 12.\n(No sense going crazy.)\nCharlie Munger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman and my partner,\nand I want to build a collection of companies - both wholly- and\npartly-owned - that have excellent economic characteristics and\nthat are run by outstanding managers.\nOur favorite acquisition\nis the negotiated transaction that allows us to purchase 100% of\nsuch a business at a fair price.\nBut we are almost as happy when\nthe stock market offers us the chance to buy a modest percentage\nof an outstanding business at a pro-rata price well below what it\nwould take to buy 100%.\nThis double-barrelled approach -\npurchases of entire businesses through negotiation or purchases\nof part-interests through the stock market - gives us an\nimportant advantage over capital-allocators who stick to a single\ncourse.\nWoody Allen once explained why eclecticism works:\n\"The\nreal advantage of being bisexual is that it doubles your chances\nfor a date on Saturday night.\"\nOver the years, we've been Woody-like in our thinking,\nattempting to increase our marketable investments in wonderful\nbusinesses, while simultaneously trying to buy similar businesses\nin their entirety.\nThe following table illustrates our progress\non both fronts.\nIn the tabulation, we show the marketable\nsecurities owned per share of Berkshire at ten-year intervals.\nA\nsecond column lists our per-share operating earnings (before\ntaxes and purchase-price adjustments but after interest and\ncorporate overhead) from all other activities.\nIn other words,\nthe second column shows what we earned excluding the dividends,\ninterest and capital gains that we realized from investments.\nPurchase-price accounting adjustments are ignored for reasons we\nhave explained at length in previous reports and which, as an act\nof mercy, we won't repeat.\n(We'll be glad to send masochists the\nearlier explanations, however.)\nPre-tax Earnings Per Share\nMarketable Securities\nExcluding All Income from\nYear\nPer Share\nInvestments\n----\n---------------------\n--------------------------\n1965 ................\n$\n4\n$\n4.08\n1975 ................\n159\n(6.48)\n1985 ................\n2,443\n18.86\n1995 ................\n22,088\n258.20\nYearly Growth Rate: 1965-95\n33.4%\n14.7%\nThese results have not sprung from some master plan that we\nconcocted in 1965.\nIn a general way, we knew then what we hoped\nto accomplish but had no idea what specific opportunities might\nmake it possible.\nToday we remain similarly unstructured:\nOver\ntime, we expect to improve the figures in both columns but have\nno road map to tell us how that will come about.\nWe proceed with two advantages:\nFirst, our operating\nmanagers are outstanding and, in most cases, have an unusually\nstrong attachment to Berkshire.\nSecond, Charlie and I have had\nconsiderable experience in allocating capital and try to go at\nthat job rationally and objectively.\nThe giant disadvantage we\nface is size:\nIn the early years, we needed only good ideas, but\nnow we need good big ideas.\nUnfortunately, the difficulty of\nfinding these grows in direct proportion to our financial\nsuccess, a problem that increasingly erodes our strengths.\nI will have more to say about Berkshire's prospects later in\nthis report, when I discuss our proposed recapitalization.\nAcquisitions\nIt may seem strange that we exult over a year in which we\nmade three acquisitions, given that we have regularly used these\npages to question the acquisition activities of most managers.\nRest assured, Charlie and I haven't lost our skepticism:\nWe\nbelieve most deals do damage to the shareholders of the acquiring\ncompany.\nToo often, the words from HMS Pinafore apply:\n\"Things\nare seldom what they seem, skim milk masquerades as cream.\"\nSpecifically, sellers and their representatives invariably\npresent financial projections having more entertainment value\nthan educational value.\nIn the production of rosy scenarios,\nWall Street can hold its own against Washington.\nIn any case, why potential buyers even look at projections\nprepared by sellers baffles me.\nCharlie and I never give them a\nglance, but instead keep in mind the story of the man with an\nailing horse.\nVisiting the vet, he said:\n\"Can you help me?\nSometimes my horse walks just fine and sometimes he limps.\"\nThe\nvet's reply was pointed:\n\"No problem - when he's walking fine,\nsell him.\"\nIn the world of mergers and acquisitions, that horse\nwould be peddled as Secretariat.\nAt Berkshire, we have all the difficulties in perceiving the\nfuture that other acquisition-minded companies do.\nLike they\nalso, we face the inherent problem that the seller of a business\npractically always knows far more about it than the buyer and\nalso picks the time of sale - a time when the business is likely\nto be walking \"just fine.\"\nEven so, we do have a few advantages, perhaps the greatest\nbeing that we don't have a strategic plan.\nThus we feel no need\nto proceed in an ordained direction (a course leading almost\ninvariably to silly purchase prices) but can instead simply\ndecide what makes sense for our owners.\nIn doing that, we always\nmentally compare any move we are contemplating with dozens of\nother opportunities open to us, including the purchase of small\npieces of the best businesses in the world via the stock market.\nOur practice of making this comparison - acquisitions against\npassive investments - is a discipline that managers focused\nsimply on expansion seldom use.\nTalking to Time Magazine a few years back, Peter Drucker got\nto the heart of things:\n\"I will tell you a secret: Dealmaking\nbeats working.\nDealmaking is exciting and fun, and working is\ngrubby.\nRunning anything is primarily an enormous amount of\ngrubby detail work . . . dealmaking is romantic, sexy.\nThat's\nwhy you have deals that make no sense.\"\nIn making acquisitions, we have a further advantage:\nAs\npayment, we can offer sellers a stock backed by an extraordinary\ncollection of outstanding businesses.\nAn individual or a family\nwishing to dispose of a single fine business, but also wishing to\ndefer personal taxes indefinitely, is apt to find Berkshire stock\na particularly comfortable holding.\nI believe, in fact, that\nthis calculus played an important part in the two acquisitions\nfor which we paid shares in 1995.\nBeyond that, sellers sometimes care about placing their\ncompanies in a corporate home that will both endure and provide\npleasant, productive working conditions for their managers.\nHere\nagain, Berkshire offers something special.\nOur managers operate\nwith extraordinary autonomy.\nAdditionally, our ownership\nstructure enables sellers to know that when I say we are buying\nto keep, the promise means something.\nFor our part, we like\ndealing with owners who care what happens to their companies and\npeople.\nA buyer is likely to find fewer unpleasant surprises\ndealing with that type of seller than with one simply auctioning\noff his business.\nIn addition to the foregoing being an explanation of our\nacquisition style, it is, of course, a not-so-subtle sales pitch.\nIf you own or represent a business earning $25 million or more\nbefore tax, and it fits the criteria listed on page 23, just\ngive me a call.\nOur discussion will be confidential.\nAnd if you\naren't interested now, file our proposition in the back of your\nmind:\nWe are never going to lose our appetite for buying\ncompanies with good economics and excellent management.\nConcluding this little dissertation on acquisitions, I can't\nresist repeating a tale told me last year by a corporate\nexecutive.\nThe business he grew up in was a fine one, with a\nlong-time record of leadership in its industry.\nIts main\nproduct, however, was distressingly glamorless.\nSo several\ndecades ago, the company hired a management consultant who -\nnaturally - advised diversification, the then-current fad.\n(\"Focus\" was not yet in style.)\nBefore long, the company\nacquired a number of businesses, each after the consulting firm\nhad gone through a long - and expensive - acquisition study.\nAnd\nthe outcome?\nSaid the executive sadly, \"When we started, we were\ngetting 100% of our earnings from the original business.\nAfter\nten years, we were getting 150%.\"\nHelzberg's Diamond Shops\nA few years back, management consultants popularized a\ntechnique called \"management by walking around\" (MBWA).\nAt\nBerkshire, we've instituted ABWA (acquisitions by walking\naround).\nIn May 1994, a week or so after the Annual Meeting, I was\ncrossing the street at 58th and Fifth Avenue in New York, when a\nwoman called out my name.\nI listened as she told me she'd been\nto, and had enjoyed, the Annual Meeting.\nA few seconds later, a\nman who'd heard the woman stop me did so as well.\nHe turned out\nto be Barnett Helzberg, Jr., who owned four shares of Berkshire\nand had also been at our meeting.\nIn our few minutes of conversation, Barnett said he had a\nbusiness we might be interested in.\nWhen people say that, it\nusually turns out they have a lemonade stand - with potential, of\ncourse, to quickly grow into the next Microsoft.\nSo I simply\nasked Barnett to send me particulars.\nThat, I thought to myself.\nwill be the end of that.\nNot long after, Barnett sent me the financial statements of\nHelzberg's Diamond Shops.\nThe company had been started by his\ngrandfather in 1915 from a single store in Kansas City and had\ndeveloped by the time we met into a group with 134 stores in 23\nstates.\nSales had grown from $10 million in 1974 to $53 million\nin 1984 and $282 million in 1994.\nWe weren't talking lemonade\nstands.\nBarnett, then 60, loved the business but also wanted to feel\nfree of it.\nIn 1988, as a step in that direction, he had brought\nin Jeff Comment, formerly President of Wanamaker's, to help him\nrun things.\nThe hiring of Jeff turned out to be a homerun, but\nBarnett still found that he couldn't shake a feeling of ultimate\nresponsibility.\nAdditionally, he owned a valuable asset that was\nsubject to the vagaries of a single, very competitive industry,\nand he thought it prudent to diversify his family's holdings.\nBerkshire was made to order for him.\nIt took us awhile to\nget together on price, but there was never any question in my\nmind that, first, Helzberg's was the kind of business that we\nwanted to own and, second, Jeff was our kind of manager.\nIn\nfact, we would not have bought the business if Jeff had not been\nthere to run it.\nBuying a retailer without good management is\nlike buying the Eiffel Tower without an elevator.\nWe completed the Helzberg purchase in 1995 by means of a\ntax-free exchange of stock, the only kind of transaction that\ninterested Barnett.\nThough he was certainly under no obligation\nto do so, Barnett shared a meaningful part of his proceeds from\nthe sale with a large number of his associates.\nWhen someone\nbehaves that generously, you know you are going to be treated\nright as a buyer.\nThe average Helzberg's store has annual sales of about $2\nmillion, far more than competitors operating similarly-sized\nstores achieve.\nThis superior per-store productivity is the key\nto Helzberg's excellent profits.\nIf the company continues its\nfirst-rate performance - and we believe it will - it could grow\nrather quickly to several times its present size.\nHelzberg's, it should be added, is an entirely different\nsort of operation from Borsheim's, our Omaha jewelry business,\nand the two companies will operate independently of each other.\nBorsheim's had an excellent year in 1995, with sales up 11.7%.\nSusan Jacques, its 36-year-old CEO, had an even better year,\ngiving birth to her second son at the start of the Christmas\nseason.\nSusan has proved to be a terrific leader in the two\nyears since her promotion.\nR.C. Willey Home Furnishings\nIt was Nebraska Furniture Mart's Irv Blumkin who did the\nwalking around in the case of R.C. Willey, long the leading home\nfurnishings business in Utah.\nOver the years, Irv had told me\nabout the strengths of that company.\nAnd he had also told Bill\nChild, CEO of R.C. Willey, how pleased the Blumkin family had\nbeen with its Berkshire relationship.\nSo in early 1995, Bill\nmentioned to Irv that for estate tax and diversification reasons,\nhe and the other owners of R.C. Willey might be interested in\nselling.\nFrom that point forward, things could not have been simpler.\nBill sent me some figures, and I wrote him a letter indicating\nmy idea of value.\nWe quickly agreed on a number, and found our\npersonal chemistry to be perfect.\nBy mid-year, the merger was\ncompleted.\nR.C. Willey is an amazing story.\nBill took over the\nbusiness from his father-in-law in 1954 when sales were about\n$250,000.\nFrom this tiny base, Bill employed Mae West's\nphilosophy:\n\"It's not what you've got - it's what you do with\nwhat you've got.\"\nAided by his brother, Sheldon, Bill has built\nthe company to its 1995 sales volume of $257 million, and it now\naccounts for over 50% of the furniture business in Utah.\nLike\nNebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey sells appliances,\nelectronics, computers and carpets in addition to furniture.\nBoth companies have about the same sales volume, but NFM gets all\nof its business from one complex in Omaha, whereas R.C. Willey\nwill open its sixth major store in the next few months.\nRetailing is a tough business.\nDuring my investment career,\nI have watched a large number of retailers enjoy terrific growth\nand superb returns on equity for a period, and then suddenly\nnosedive, often all the way into bankruptcy.\nThis shooting-star\nphenomenon is far more common in retailing than it is in\nmanufacturing or service businesses.\nIn part, this is because a\nretailer must stay smart, day after day.\nYour competitor is\nalways copying and then topping whatever you do.\nShoppers are\nmeanwhile beckoned in every conceivable way to try a stream of\nnew merchants.\nIn retailing, to coast is to fail.\nIn contrast to this have-to-be-smart-every-day business,\nthere is what I call the have-to-be-smart-once business.\nFor\nexample, if you were smart enough to buy a network TV station\nvery early in the game, you could put in a shiftless and backward\nnephew to run things, and the business would still do well for\ndecades.\nYou'd do far better, of course, if you put in Tom\nMurphy, but you could stay comfortably in the black without him.\nFor a retailer, hiring that nephew would be an express ticket to\nbankruptcy.\nThe two retailing businesses we purchased this year are\nblessed with terrific managers who love to compete and have done\nso successfully for decades.\nLike the CEOs of our other\noperating units, they will operate autonomously:\nWe want them to\nfeel that the businesses they run are theirs.\nThis means no\nsecond-guessing by Charlie and me.\nWe avoid the attitude of the\nalumnus whose message to the football coach is \"I'm 100% with you\n- win or tie.\"\nOur basic goal as an owner is to behave with our\nmanagers as we like our owners to behave with us.\nAs we add more operations, I'm sometimes asked how many\npeople I can handle reporting to me.\nMy answer to that is\nsimple:\nIf I have one person reporting to me and he is a lemon,\nthat's one too many, and if I have managers like those we now\nhave, the number can be almost unlimited.\nWe are lucky to have\nBill and Sheldon associated with us, and we hope that we can\nacquire other businesses that bring with them managers of similar\ncaliber.\nGEICO Corporation\nRight after yearend, we completed the purchase of 100% of\nGEICO, the seventh largest auto insurer in the United States,\nwith about 3.7 million cars insured.\nI've had a 45-year\nassociation with GEICO, and though the story has been told\nbefore, it's worth a short recap here.\nI attended Columbia University's business school in 1950-51,\nnot because I cared about the degree it offered, but because I\nwanted to study under Ben Graham, then teaching there.\nThe time\nI spent in Ben's classes was a personal high, and quickly induced\nme to learn all I could about my hero.\nI turned first to Who's\nWho in America, finding there, among other things, that Ben was\nChairman of Government Employees Insurance Company, to me an\nunknown company in an unfamiliar industry.\nA librarian next referred me to Best's Fire and Casualty\ninsurance manual, where I learned that GEICO was based in\nWashington, DC.\nSo on a Saturday in January, 1951, I took the\ntrain to Washington and headed for GEICO's downtown headquarters.\nTo my dismay, the building was closed, but I pounded on the door\nuntil a custodian appeared.\nI asked this puzzled fellow if there\nwas anyone in the office I could talk to, and he said he'd seen\none man working on the sixth floor.\nAnd thus I met Lorimer Davidson, Assistant to the President,\nwho was later to become CEO.\nThough my only credentials were\nthat I was a student of Graham's, \"Davy\" graciously spent four\nhours or so showering me with both kindness and instruction.\nNo\none has ever received a better half-day course in how the\ninsurance industry functions nor in the factors that enable one\ncompany to excel over others.\nAs Davy made clear, GEICO's method\nof selling - direct marketing - gave it an enormous cost\nadvantage over competitors that sold through agents, a form of\ndistribution so ingrained in the business of these insurers that\nit was impossible for them to give it up.\nAfter my session with\nDavy, I was more excited about GEICO than I have ever been about\na stock.\nWhen I finished at Columbia some months later and returned\nto Omaha to sell securities, I naturally focused almost\nexclusively on GEICO.\nMy first sales call - on my Aunt Alice,\nwho always supported me 100% - was successful.\nBut I was then a\nskinny, unpolished 20-year-old who looked about 17, and my pitch\nusually failed.\nUndaunted, I wrote a short report late in 1951\nabout GEICO for \"The Security I Like Best\" column in The\nCommercial and Financial Chronicle, a leading financial\npublication of the time.\nMore important, I bought stock for my\nown account.\nYou may think this odd, but I have kept copies of every tax\nreturn I filed, starting with the return for 1944.\nChecking\nback, I find that I purchased GEICO shares on four occasions\nduring 1951, the last purchase being made on September 26.\nThis\npattern of persistence suggests to me that my tendency toward\nself-intoxication was developed early.\nI probably came back on\nthat September day from unsuccessfully trying to sell some\nprospect and decided - despite my already having more than 50% of\nmy net worth in GEICO - to load up further.\nIn any event, I\naccumulated 350 shares of GEICO during the year, at a cost of\n$10,282.\nAt yearend, this holding was worth $13,125, more than\n65% of my net worth.\nYou can see why GEICO was my first business love.\nFurthermore,\njust to complete this stroll down memory lane, I should add\nthat I earned most of the funds I used to buy GEICO shares by\ndelivering The Washington Post, the chief product of a\ncompany that much later made it possible for Berkshire to turn\n$10 million into $500 million.\nAlas, I sold my entire GEICO position in 1952 for $15,259,\nprimarily to switch into Western Insurance Securities.\nThis act\nof infidelity can partially be excused by the fact that Western\nwas selling for slightly more than one times its current earnings,\na p/e ratio that for some reason caught my eye.\nBut in the next\n20 years, the GEICO stock I sold grew in value to about $1.3\nmillion, which taught me a lesson about the inadvisability of\nselling a stake in an identifiably-wonderful company.\nIn the early 1970's, after Davy retired, the executives\nrunning GEICO made some serious errors in estimating their claims\ncosts, a mistake that led the company to underprice its policies\n- and that almost caused it to go bankrupt.\nThe company was\nsaved only because Jack Byrne came in as CEO in 1976 and took\ndrastic remedial measures.\nBecause I believed both in Jack and in GEICO's fundamental\ncompetitive strength, Berkshire purchased a large interest in the\ncompany during the second half of 1976, and also made smaller\npurchases later.\nBy yearend 1980, we had put $45.7 million into\nGEICO and owned 33.3% of its shares.\nDuring the next 15 years,\nwe did not make further purchases.\nOur interest in the company,\nnonetheless, grew to about 50% because it was a big repurchaser\nof its own shares.\nThen, in 1995, we agreed to pay $2.3 billion for the half of\nthe company we didn't own.\nThat is a steep price.\nBut it gives\nus full ownership of a growing enterprise whose business remains\nexceptional for precisely the same reasons that prevailed in\n1951.\nIn addition, GEICO has two extraordinary managers:\nTony\nNicely, who runs the insurance side of the operation, and Lou\nSimpson, who runs investments.\nTony, 52, has been with GEICO for 34 years.\nThere's no one\nI would rather have managing GEICO's insurance operation.\nHe has\nbrains, energy, integrity and focus.\nIf we're lucky, he'll stay\nanother 34 years.\nLou runs investments just as ably.\nBetween 1980 and 1995,\nthe equities under Lou's management returned an average of 22.8%\nannually vs. 15.7% for the S&P.\nLou takes the same conservative,\nconcentrated approach to investments that we do at Berkshire, and\nit is an enormous plus for us to have him on board.\nOne point\nthat goes beyond Lou's GEICO work:\nHis presence on the scene\nassures us that Berkshire would have an extraordinary\nprofessional immediately available to handle its investments if\nsomething were to happen to Charlie and me.\nGEICO, of course, must continue both to attract good\npolicyholders and keep them happy.\nIt must also reserve and\nprice properly.\nBut the ultimate key to the company's success is\nits rock-bottom operating costs, which virtually no competitor\ncan match.\nIn 1995, moreover, Tony and his management team\npushed underwriting and loss adjustment expenses down further to\n23.6% of premiums, nearly one percentage point below 1994's\nratio.\nIn business, I look for economic castles protected by\nunbreachable \"moats.\"\nThanks to Tony and his management team,\nGEICO's moat widened in 1995.\nFinally, let me bring you up to date on Davy.\nHe's now 93\nand remains my friend and teacher.\nHe continues to pay close\nattention to GEICO and has always been there when the company's\nCEOs - Jack Byrne, Bill Snyder and Tony - have needed him.\nOur\nacquisition of 100% of GEICO caused Davy to incur a large tax.\nCharacteristically, he still warmly supported the transaction.\nDavy has been one of my heroes for the 45 years I've known\nhim, and he's never let me down.\nYou should understand that\nBerkshire would not be where it is today if Davy had not been so\ngenerous with his time on a cold Saturday in 1951.\nI've often\nthanked him privately, but it is fitting that I use this report\nto thank him on behalf of Berkshire's shareholders.\nInsurance Operations\nIn addition to acquiring GEICO, we enjoyed other favorable\ndevelopments in insurance during 1995.\nAs we've explained in past reports, what counts in our\ninsurance business is, first, the amount of \"float\" we generate\nand, second, its cost to us.\nFloat is money we hold but don't\nown.\nIn an insurance operation, float arises because most\npolicies require that premiums be prepaid and, more importantly,\nbecause it usually takes time for an insurer to hear about and\nresolve loss claims.\nTypically, the premiums that an insurer takes in do not\ncover the losses and expenses it must pay.\nThat leaves it\nrunning an \"underwriting loss\" - and that loss is the cost of\nfloat.\nAn insurance business is profitable over time if its cost\nof float is less than the cost the company would otherwise incur\nto obtain funds.\nBut the business has a negative value if the\ncost of its float is higher than market rates for money.\nAs the numbers in the following table show, Berkshire's\ninsurance business has been a huge winner.\nFor the table, we\nhave calculated our float -\nwhich we generate in exceptional\namounts relative to our premium volume - by adding loss reserves,\nloss adjustment reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed\nand unearned premium reserves, and then subtracting agents'\nbalances, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid taxes and deferred\ncharges applicable to assumed reinsurance.\nOur cost of float is\ndetermined by our underwriting loss or profit.\nIn those years\nwhen we have had an underwriting profit, such as the last three,\nour cost of float has been negative, which means we have\ncalculated our insurance earnings by adding underwriting profit\nto float income.\n(1)\n(2)\nYearend Yield\nUnderwriting\nApproximate\non Long-Term\nLoss\nAverage Float\nCost of Funds\nGovt.

(2) what its liabilities cost;\nand (3) its utilization of \"leverage\" - that is, the degree to\nwhich its assets are funded by liabilities rather than by equity.\nOver the years, we have done well on Point 1, having produced high\nreturns on our assets.\nBut we have also benefitted greatly - to a\ndegree that is not generally well-understood - because our\nliabilities have cost us very little.\nAn important reason for this\nlow cost is that we have obtained float on very advantageous terms.\nThe same cannot be said by many other property and casualty\ninsurers, who may generate plenty of float, but at a cost that\nexceeds what the funds are worth to them.\nIn those circumstances,\nleverage becomes a disadvantage.\nSince our float has cost us virtually nothing over the years,\nit has in effect served as equity.\nOf course, it differs from true\nequity in that it doesn't belong to us.\nNevertheless, let's assume\nthat instead of our having $3.4 billion of float at the end of\n1994, we had replaced it with $3.4 billion of equity.\nUnder this\nscenario, we would have owned no more assets than we did during\n1995.\nWe would, however, have had somewhat lower earnings because\nthe cost of float was negative last year.\nThat is, our float threw\noff profits.\nAnd, of course, to obtain the replacement equity, we\nwould have needed to sell many new shares of Berkshire.\nThe net\nresult - more shares, equal assets and lower earnings - would have\nmaterially reduced the value of our stock.\nSo you can understand\nwhy float wonderfully benefits a business - if it is obtained at a\nlow cost.\nOur acquisition of GEICO will immediately increase our float\nby nearly $3 billion, with additional growth almost certain.\nWe\nalso expect GEICO to operate at a decent underwriting profit in\nmost years, a fact that will increase the probability that our\ntotal float will cost us nothing.\nOf course, we paid a very\nsubstantial price for the GEICO float, whereas virtually all of the\ngains in float depicted in the table were developed internally.\nOur enthusiasm over 1995's insurance results must be tempered\nonce again because we had our third straight year of good fortune\nin the super-cat business.\nIn this operation, we sell policies\nthat insurance and reinsurance companies buy to protect themselves\nfrom the effects of mega-catastrophes.\nSince truly major\ncatastrophes occur infrequently, our super-cat business can be\nexpected to show large profits in most years but occasionally to\nrecord a huge loss.\nIn other words, the attractiveness of our\nsuper-cat business will take many years to measure.\nWe know that\nthe results of years like the past three will be at least partially\noffset by some truly terrible year in the future.\nWe just hope\nthat \"partially\" turns out to be the proper adverb.\nThere were plenty of catastrophes last year, but no super-cats\nof the insured variety.\nThe Southeast had a close call when Opal,\nsporting winds of 150 miles per hour, hovered off Florida.\nHowever, the storm abated before hitting land, and so a second\nAndrew was dodged.\nFor insurers, the Kobe earthquake was another\nclose call:\nThe economic damage was huge - perhaps even a record -\nbut only a tiny portion of it was insured.\nThe insurance industry\nwon't always be that lucky.\nAjit Jain is the guiding genius of our super-cat business and\nwrites important non-cat business as well. In insurance, the term\n\"catastrophe\" is applied to an event, such as a hurricane or\nearthquake, that causes a great many insured losses. The other\ndeals Ajit enters into usually cover only a single large loss. A\nsimplified description of three transactions from last year will\nillustrate both what I mean and Ajit's versatility. We insured: (1)\nThe life of Mike Tyson for a sum that is large initially and that,\nfight-by-fight, gradually declines to zero over the next few years;\n(2) Lloyd's against more than 225 of its \"names\" dying during the\nyear; and (3) The launch, and a year of orbit, of two Chinese\nsatellites. Happily, both satellites are orbiting, the Lloyd's folk\navoided abnormal mortality, and if Mike Tyson looked any healthier,\nno one would get in the ring with him.\nBerkshire is sought out for many kinds of insurance, both\nsuper-cat and large single-risk, because: (1) our financial\nstrength is unmatched, and insureds know we can and will pay our\nlosses under the most adverse of circumstances; (2) we can supply a\nquote faster than anyone in the business; and (3) we will issue\npolicies with limits larger than anyone else is prepared to write.\nMost of our competitors have extensive reinsurance treaties and\nlay off much of their business.\nWhile this helps them avoid shock\nlosses, it also hurts their flexibility and reaction time.\nAs you\nknow, Berkshire moves quickly to seize investment and acquisition\nopportunities; in insurance we respond with the same exceptional\nspeed.\nIn another important point, large coverages don't frighten\nus but, on the contrary, intensify our interest.\nWe have offered a\npolicy under which we could have lost $1 billion; the largest\ncoverage that a client accepted was $400 million.\nWe will get hit from time to time with large losses.\nCharlie\nand I, however, are quite willing to accept relatively volatile\nresults in exchange for better long-term earnings than we would\notherwise have had.\nIn other words, we prefer a lumpy 15% to a\nsmooth 12%.\nSince most managers opt for smoothness, we are left\nwith a competitive advantage that we try to maximize.\nWe do,\nthough, monitor our aggregate exposure in order to keep our \"worst\ncase\" at a level that leaves us comfortable.\nIndeed, our worst case from a \"once-in-a-century\" super-cat is\nfar less severe - relative to net worth - than that faced by many\nwell-known primary companies writing great numbers of property\npolicies.\nThese insurers don't issue single huge-limit policies as\nwe do, but their small policies, in aggregate, can create a risk of\nstaggering size.\nThe \"big one\" would blow right through the\nreinsurance covers of some of these insurers, exposing them to\nuncapped losses that could threaten their survival.\nIn our case,\nlosses would be large, but capped at levels we could easily handle.\nPrices are weakening in the super-cat field.\nThat is\nunderstandable considering the influx of capital into the\nreinsurance business a few years ago and the natural desire of\nthose holding the capital to employ it.\nNo matter what others may\ndo, we will not knowingly write business at inadequate rates.\nWe\nunwittingly did this in the early 1970's and, after more than 20\nyears, regularly receive significant bills stemming from the\nmistakes of that era.\nMy guess is that we will still be getting\nsurprises from that business 20 years from now.\nA bad reinsurance\ncontract is like hell:\neasy to enter and impossible to exit.\nI actively participated in those early reinsurance decisions,\nand Berkshire paid a heavy tuition for my education in the\nbusiness.\nUnfortunately, reinsurance students can't attend school\non scholarship.\nGEICO, incidentally, suffered a similar,\ndisastrous experience in the early 1980's, when it plunged\nenthusiastically into the writing of reinsurance and large risks.\nGEICO's folly was brief, but it will be cleaning things up for at\nleast another decade.\nThe well-publicized problems at Lloyd's\nfurther illustrate the perils of reinsurance and also underscore\nhow vital it is that the interests of the people who write\ninsurance business be aligned - on the downside as well as the\nupside - with those of the people putting up the capital.\nWhen\nthat kind of symmetry is missing, insurers almost invariably run\ninto trouble, though its existence may remain hidden for some time.\nA small, apocryphal story about an insurance CEO who was\nvisited by an analyst tells a lot about this industry.\nTo the\nanalyst's questions about his business, the CEO had nothing but\ngloomy answers:\nRates were ridiculously low; the reserves on his\nbalance sheet weren't adequate for ordinary claims, much less those\nlikely to arise from asbestos and environmental problems; most of\nhis reinsurers had long since gone broke, leaving him holding the\nsack.\nBut then the CEO brightened:\n\"Still, things could be a lot\nworse,\" he said.\n\"It could be my money.\"\nAt Berkshire, it's our\nmoney.\nBerkshire's other insurance operations, though relatively\nsmall, performed magnificently in 1995.\nNational Indemnity's\ntraditional business had a combined ratio of 84.2 and developed, as\nusual, a large amount of float compared to premium volume.\nOver\nthe last three years, this segment of our business, run by Don\nWurster, has had an average combined ratio of 85.6.\nOur homestate\noperation, managed by Rod Eldred, grew at a good rate in 1995 and\nachieved a combined ratio of 81.4.\nIts three-year combined ratio\nis an amazing 82.4.\nBerkshire's California workers' compensation\nbusiness, run by Brad Kinstler, faced fierce price-cutting in 1995\nand lost a great many renewals when we refused to accept inadequate\nrates.\nThough this operation's volume dropped materially, it\nproduced an excellent underwriting profit.\nFinally, John Kizer, at\nCentral States Indemnity, continues to do an extraordinary job.\nHis premium volume was up 23% in 1995, and underwriting profit grew\nby 59%.\nAjit, Don, Rod, Brad and John are all under 45, an\nembarrassing fact demolishing my theory that managers only hit\ntheir stride after they reach 70.\nTo sum up, we entered 1995 with an exceptional insurance\noperation of moderate size.\nBy adding GEICO, we entered 1996 with\na business still better in quality, much improved in its growth\nprospects, and doubled in size.\nMore than ever, insurance is our\ncore strength.\nSources of Reported Earnings\nThe table below shows the main sources of Berkshire's reported\nearnings.\nIn this presentation, purchase-premium charges are not\nassigned to the specific businesses to which they apply, but are\ninstead aggregated and shown separately.\nThis procedure lets you\nview the earnings of our businesses as they would have been\nreported had we not purchased them.\nThis form of presentation\nseems to us to be more useful to investors and managers than one\nutilizing GAAP, which requires purchase-premiums to be charged off,\nbusiness-by-business.\nThe total earnings we show in the table are,\nof course, identical to the GAAP total in our audited financial\nstatements.\n(in millions)\n---------------------------------------\nBerkshire's Share\nof Net Earnings\n(after taxes and\nPre-Tax Earnings\nminority interests)\n------------------\n------------------\n1995\n1994\n1995\n1994\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nOperating Earnings:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting ............... $\n20.5\n$129.9\n$ 11.3\n$ 80.9\nNet Investment Income ......\n501.6\n419.4\n417.7\n350.5\nBuffalo News .................\n46.8\n54.2\n27.3\n31.7\nFechheimer ...................\n16.9\n14.3\n8.8\n7.1\nFinance Businesses ...........\n20.8\n22.1\n12.6\n14.6\nHome Furnishings .............\n29.7(1)\n17.4\n16.7(1)\n8.7\nJewelry ......................\n33.9(2)\n---(3)\n19.1(2)\n---(3)\nKirby ........................\n50.2\n42.3\n32.1\n27.7\nScott Fetzer Manufacturing Group\n34.1\n39.5\n21.2\n24.9\nSee's Candies ................\n50.2\n47.5\n29.8\n28.2\nShoe Group ...................\n58.4\n85.5\n37.5\n55.8\nWorld Book ...................\n8.8\n24.7\n7.0\n17.3\nPurchase-Price Premium Charges\n(27.0)\n(22.6)\n(23.4)\n(19.4)\nInterest Expense(4) ..........\n(56.0)\n(60.1)\n(34.9)\n(37.3)\nShareholder-Designated\nContributions ............\n(11.6)\n(10.4)\n(7.0)\n(6.7)\nOther ........................\n37.4\n35.7\n24.4\n22.3\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nOperating Earnings .............\n814.7\n839.4\n600.2\n606.2\nSales of Securities ............\n194.1\n91.3\n125.0\n61.1\nDecline in Value of\nUSAir Preferred Stock ......\n---\n(268.5)\n---\n(172.6)\n---------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nTotal Earnings - All Entities\n$1,008.8\n$662.2\n$725.2\n$494.8\n=========\n========\n========\n========\n(1) Includes R.C.

\"Just tell me\nthe bad news; the good news will take care of itself\" - and that is\nthe behavior we expect of our managers when they are reporting to\nus.\nConsequently, I also owe you - Berkshire's owners - a report\non three operations that, though they continued to earn decent (or\nbetter) returns on invested capital, experienced a decline in\nearnings last year.\nEach encountered a different type of problem.\nOur shoe business operated in an industry that suffered\ndepressed earnings throughout last year, and many of our\ncompetitors made only marginal profits or worse.\nThat means we at\nleast maintained, and in some instances widened, our competitive\nsuperiority.\nSo I have no doubt that our shoe operations will\nclimb back to top-grade earnings in the future.\nIn other words,\nthough the turn has not yet occurred, we believe you should view\nlast year's figures as reflecting a cyclical problem, not a secular\none.\nThe Buffalo News, though still doing very well in comparison\nto other newspapers, is another story.\nIn this case, industry\ntrends are not good.\nIn the 1991 Annual Report, I explained that\nnewspapers had lost a notch in their economic attractiveness from\nthe days when they appeared to have a bullet-proof franchise.\nToday, the industry retains its excellent economics, but has lost\nstill another notch.\nOver time, we expect the competitive strength\nof newspapers to gradually erode, though the industry should\nnevertheless remain a fine business for many years to come.\nBerkshire's most difficult problem is World Book, which\noperates in an industry beset by increasingly tough competition\nfrom CD-ROM and on-line offerings.\nTrue, we are still profitable,\na claim that perhaps no other print encyclopedia can make.\nBut our\nsales and earnings trends have gone in the wrong direction.\nAt the\nend of 1995, World Book made major changes in the way it\ndistributes its product, stepped up its efforts with electronic\nproducts and sharply reduced its overhead costs.\nIt will take time\nfor us to evaluate the effects of these initiatives, but we are\nconfident they will significantly improve our viability.\nAll of our operations, including those whose earnings fell\nlast year, benefit from exceptionally talented and dedicated\nmanagers.\nWere we to have the choice of any other executives now\nworking in their industries, there is not one of our managers we\nwould replace.\nMany of our managers don't have to work for a living, but\nsimply go out and perform every day for the same reason that\nwealthy golfers stay on the tour:\nThey love both doing what they\ndo and doing it well.\nTo describe them as working may be a\nmisnomer - they simply prefer spending much of their time on a\nproductive activity at which they excel to spending it on leisure\nactivities.\nOur job is to provide an environment that will keep\nthem feeling this way, and so far we seem to have succeeded:\nThinking back over the 1965-95 period, I can't recall that a single\nkey manager has left Berkshire to join another employer.\nCommon Stock Investments\nBelow we present our common stock investments.\nThose with a\nmarket value of more than $600 million are itemized.\n12/31/95\nShares\nCompany\nCost\nMarket\n----------\n-------\n--------\n--------\n(dollars in millions)\n49,456,900\nAmerican Express Company .............\n$1,392.7\n$2,046.3\n20,000,000\nCapital Cities/ABC, Inc. .............\n345.0\n2,467.5\n100,000,000\nThe Coca-Cola Company ................\n1,298.9\n7,425.0\n12,502,500\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.\n(\"Freddie Mac\") ...................\n260.1\n1,044.0\n34,250,000\nGEICO Corp. ..........................\n45.7\n2,393.2\n48,000,000\nThe Gillette Company .................\n600.0\n2,502.0\n6,791,218\nWells Fargo & Company ................\n423.7\n1,466.9\nOthers ...............................\n1,379.0\n2,655.4\n--------\n---------\nTotal Common Stocks ..................\n$5,745.1\n$22,000.3\n========\n=========\nWe continue in our Rip Van Winkle mode:\nFive of our six top\npositions at yearend 1994 were left untouched during 1995.\nThe\nsixth was American Express, in which we increased our ownership to\nabout 10%.\nIn early 1996, two major events affected our holdings:\nFirst,\nour purchase of the GEICO stock we did not already own caused that\ncompany to be converted into a wholly-owned subsidiary.\nSecond, we\nexchanged our Cap Cities shares for a combination of cash and\nDisney stock.\nIn the Disney merger, Cap Cities shareholders had a choice of\nactions.\nIf they chose, they could exchange each of their Cap\nCities shares for one share of Disney stock plus $65.\nOr they\ncould ask for - though not necessarily get - all cash or all stock,\nwith their ultimate allotment of each depending on the choices made\nby other shareholders and certain decisions made by Disney.\nFor\nour 20 million shares, we sought stock, but do not know, as this\nreport goes to press, how much we were allocated.\nWe are certain,\nhowever, to receive something over 20 million Disney shares.\nWe\nhave also recently bought Disney stock in the market.\nOne more bit of history:\nI first became interested in Disney\nin 1966, when its market valuation was less than $90 million, even\nthough the company had earned around $21 million pre-tax in 1965\nand was sitting with more cash than debt.\nAt Disneyland, the $17\nmillion Pirates of the Caribbean ride would soon open.\nImagine my\nexcitement - a company selling at only five times rides!\nDuly impressed, Buffett Partnership Ltd. bought a significant\namount of Disney stock at a split-adjusted price of 31 per share.\nThat decision may appear brilliant, given that the stock now sells\nfor $66.\nBut your Chairman was up to the task of nullifying it:\nIn 1967 I sold out at 48 per share.\nOh well - we're happy to be once again a large owner of a\nbusiness with both unique assets and outstanding management.\nConvertible Preferred Stocks\nAs many of you will remember, Berkshire made five private\npurchases of convertible preferred stocks during the 1987-91 period\nand the time seems right to discuss their status.\nHere are the\nparticulars:\nDividend\nYear of\nMarket\nCompany\nRate\nPurchase\nCost\nValue\n-------\n--------\n--------\n------\n--------\n(dollars in millions)\nChampion International Corp. ... 9 1/4%\n1989\n$300\n$388(1)\nFirst Empire State Corp. .......\n9%\n1991\n40\n110\nThe Gillette Company ........... 8 3/4%\n1989\n600\n2,502(2)\nSalomon Inc ....................\n9%\n1987\n700\n728(3)\nUSAir Group, Inc. .............. 9 1/4%\n1989\n358\n215\n(1) Proceeds from sale of common we received through conversion in 1995.\n(2) 12/31/95 value of common we received through conversion in 1991.\n(3) Includes $140 we received in 1995 from partial redemption.\nIn each case we had the option of sticking with these\npreferreds as fixed-income securities or converting them into\ncommon stock.\nInitially, their value to us came primarily from\ntheir fixed-income characteristics.\nThe option we had to convert\nwas a kicker.\nOur $300 million private purchase of American Express \"Percs\"\n- described in the 1991 Annual Report - is not included in the\ntable because that security was a modified form of common stock\nwhose fixed-income characteristics contributed only a minor portion\nof its initial value.\nThree years after we bought them, the Percs\nautomatically were converted to common stock.\nIn contrast, the\nfive securities in the table were set to become common stocks only\nif we wished them to - a crucial difference.\nWhen we purchased our convertible securities, I told you that\nwe expected to earn after-tax returns from them that \"moderately\"\nexceeded what we could earn from the medium-term fixed-income\nsecurities they replaced.\nWe beat this expectation - but only\nbecause of the performance of a single issue.\nI also told you that\nthese securities, as a group, would \"not produce the returns we can\nachieve when we find a business with wonderful economic prospects.\"\nUnfortunately, that prediction was fulfilled.\nFinally, I said\nthat \"under almost any conditions, we expect these preferreds to\nreturn us our money plus dividends.\"\nThat's one I would like to\nhave back.\nWinston Churchill once said that \"eating my words has\nnever given me indigestion.\"\nMy assertion, however, that it was\nalmost impossible for us to lose money on our preferreds has caused\nme some well-deserved heartburn.\nOur best holding has been Gillette, which we told you from the\nstart was a superior business.\nIronically, though, this is also\nthe purchase in which I made my biggest mistake - of a kind,\nhowever, never recognized on financial statements.\nWe paid $600 million in 1989 for Gillette preferred shares\nthat were convertible into 48 million (split-adjusted) common\nshares.\nTaking an alternative route with the $600 million, I\nprobably could have purchased 60 million shares of common from the\ncompany.\nThe market on the common was then about $10.50, and given\nthat this would have been a huge private placement carrying\nimportant restrictions, I probably could have bought the stock at a\ndiscount of at least 5%.\nI can't be sure about this, but it's\nlikely that Gillette's management would have been just as happy to\nhave Berkshire opt for common.\nBut I was far too clever to do that.\nInstead, for less than\ntwo years, we received some extra dividend income (the difference\nbetween the preferred's yield and that of the common), at which\npoint the company - quite properly - called the issue, moving to do\nthat as quickly as was possible.\nIf I had negotiated for common\nrather than preferred, we would have been better off at yearend\n1995 by $625 million, minus the \"excess\" dividends of about $70\nmillion.\nIn the case of Champion, the ability of the company to call\nour preferred at 115% of cost forced a move out of us last August\nthat we would rather have delayed.\nIn this instance, we converted\nour shares just prior to the pending call and offered them to the\ncompany at a modest discount.\nCharlie and I have never had a conviction about the paper\nindustry - actually, I can't remember ever owning the common stock\nof a paper producer in my 54 years of investing - so our choice in\nAugust was whether to sell in the market or to the company.\nChampion's management had always been candid and honorable in\ndealing with us and wished to repurchase common shares, so we\noffered our stock to the company.\nOur Champion capital gain was\nmoderate - about 19% after tax from a six-year investment - but the\npreferred delivered us a good after-tax dividend yield throughout\nour holding period.\n(That said, many press accounts have\noverstated the after-tax yields earned by property-casualty\ninsurance companies on dividends paid to them.\nWhat the press has\nfailed to take into account is a change in the tax law that took\neffect in 1987 and that significantly reduced the dividends\nreceived credit applicable to insurers.\nFor details, see our 1986\nAnnual Report.)\nOur First Empire preferred will be called on March 31, 1996,\nthe earliest date allowable.\nWe are comfortable owning stock in\nwell-run banks, and we will convert and keep our First Empire\ncommon shares.\nBob Wilmers, CEO of the company, is an outstanding\nbanker, and we love being associated with him.\nOur other two preferreds have been disappointing, though the\nSalomon preferred has modestly outperformed the fixed-income\nsecurities for which it was a substitute.\nHowever, the amount of\nmanagement time Charlie and I have devoted to this holding has been\nvastly greater than its economic significance to Berkshire.\nCertainly I never dreamed I would take a new job at age 60 -\nSalomon interim chairman, that is - because of an earlier purchase\nof a fixed-income security.\nSoon after our purchase of the Salomon preferred in 1987, I\nwrote that I had \"no special insights regarding the direction or\nfuture profitability of investment banking.\"\nEven the most\ncharitable commentator would conclude that I have since proved my\npoint.\nTo date, our option to convert into Salomon common has not\nproven of value.\nFurthermore, the Dow Industrials have doubled\nsince I committed to buy the preferred, and the brokerage group has\nperformed equally as well.\nThat means my decision to go with\nSalomon because I saw value in the conversion option must be graded\nas very poor.\nEven so, the preferred has continued under some\ntrying conditions to deliver as a fixed-income security, and the\n9% dividend is currently quite attractive.\nUnless the preferred is converted, its terms require\nredemption of 20% of the issue on October 31 of each year, 1995-99,\nand $140 million of our original $700 million was taken on schedule\nlast year.\n(Some press reports labeled this a sale, but a senior\nsecurity that matures is not \"sold.\")\nThough we did not elect to\nconvert the preferred that matured last year, we have four more\nbites at the conversion apple, and I believe it quite likely that\nwe will yet find value in our right to convert.\nI discussed the USAir investment at length in last year's\nreport.\nThe company's results improved in 1995, but it still faces\nsignificant problems.\nOn the plus side for us is the fact that our\npreferred is structurally well-designed:\nFor example, though we\nhave not been paid dividends since June 1994, the amounts owed us\nare compounding at 5% over the prime rate.\nOn the minus side is\nthe fact that we are dealing with a weak credit.\nWe feel much better about our USAir preferred than we did a\nyear ago, but your guess is as good as mine as to its ultimate\nvalue.\n(Indeed, considering my record with this investment, it's\nfair to say that your guess may be better than mine.)\nAt yearend\nwe carried our preferred (in which there is no public market) at\n60% of par, though USAir also has outstanding a junior preferred\nthat is significantly inferior to ours in all respects except\nconversion price and that was then trading at 82% of par.\nAs I\nwrite this, the junior issue has advanced to 97% of par.\nLet's\nhope the market is right.\nOverall, our preferreds have performed well, but that is true\nonly because of one huge winner, Gillette.\nLeaving aside Gillette,\nour preferreds as a group have delivered us after-tax returns no\nmore than equal to those we could have earned from the medium-term\nfixed-income issues that they replaced.\nA Proposed Recapitalization\nAt the Annual Meeting you will be asked to approve a\nrecapitalization of Berkshire, creating two classes of stock.\nIf\nthe plan is adopted, our existing common stock will be designated\nas Class A Common Stock and a new Class B Common Stock will be\nauthorized.\nEach share of the \"B\" will have the rights of 1/30th of an \"A\"\nshare with these exceptions:\nFirst, a B share will have 1/200th of\nthe vote of an A share (rather than 1/30th of the vote).\nSecond,\nthe B will not be eligible to participate in Berkshire's\nshareholder-designated charitable contributions program.\nWhen the recapitalization is complete, each share of A will\nbecome convertible, at the holder's option and at any time, into 30\nshares of B.\nThis conversion privilege will not extend in the\nopposite direction.\nThat is, holders of B shares will not be able\nto convert them into A shares.\nWe expect to list the B shares on the New York Stock Exchange,\nwhere they will trade alongside the A stock.\nTo create the\nshareholder base necessary for a listing - and to ensure a liquid\nmarket in the B stock - Berkshire expects to make a public offering\nfor cash of at least $100 million of new B shares.\nThe offering\nwill be made only by means of a prospectus.\nThe market will ultimately determine the price of the B\nshares.\nTheir price, though, should be in the neighborhood of\n1/30th of the price of the A shares.\nClass A shareholders who wish to give gifts may find it\nconvenient to convert a share or two of their stock into Class B\nshares.\nAdditionally, arbitrage-related conversions will occur if\ndemand for the B is strong enough to push its price to slightly\nabove 1/30th of the price of A.\nHowever, because the Class A stock will entitle its holders to\nfull voting rights and access to Berkshire's contributions program,\nthese shares will be superior to the Class B shares and we would\nexpect most shareholders to remain holders of the Class A - which\nis precisely what the Buffett and Munger families plan to do,\nexcept in those instances when we ourselves might convert a few\nshares to facilitate gifts.\nThe prospect that most shareholders\nwill stick to the A stock suggests that it will enjoy a somewhat\nmore liquid market than the B.\nThere are tradeoffs for Berkshire in this recapitalization.\nBut they do not arise from the proceeds of the offering - we will\nfind constructive uses for the money - nor in any degree from the\nprice at which we will sell the B shares.\nAs I write this - with\nBerkshire stock at $36,000 - Charlie and I do not believe it\nundervalued.\nTherefore, the offering we propose will not diminish\nthe per-share intrinsic value of our existing stock.\nLet me also\nput our thoughts about valuation more baldly:\nBerkshire is selling\nat a price at which Charlie and I would not consider buying it.\nWhat Berkshire will incur by way of the B stock are certain\nadded costs, including those involving the mechanics of handling a\nlarger number of shareholders.\nOn the other hand, the stock should\nbe a convenience for people wishing to make gifts.\nAnd those of\nyou who have hoped for a split have gained a do-it-yourself method\nof bringing one about.\nWe are making this move, though, for other reasons - having to\ndo with the appearance of expense-laden unit trusts purporting to\nbe low-priced \"clones\" of Berkshire and sure to be aggressively\nmarketed.\nThe idea behind these vehicles is not new:\nIn recent\nyears, a number of people have told me about their wish to create\nan \"all-Berkshire\" investment fund to be sold at a low dollar\nprice.\nBut until recently, the promoters of these investments\nheard out my objections and backed off.\nI did not discourage these people because I prefer large\ninvestors over small.\nWere it possible, Charlie and I would love\nto turn $1,000 into $3,000 for multitudes of people who would find\nthat gain an important answer to their immediate problems.\nIn order to quickly triple small stakes, however, we would\nhave to just as quickly turn our present market capitalization of\n$43 billion into $129 billion (roughly the market cap of General\nElectric, America's most highly valued company).\nWe can't come\nclose to doing that. The very best we hope for is - on average - to\ndouble Berkshire's per-share intrinsic value every five years, and\nwe may well fall far short of that goal.\nIn the end, Charlie and I do not care whether our shareholders\nown Berkshire in large or small amounts.\nWhat we wish for are\nshareholders of any size who are knowledgeable about our\noperations, share our objectives and long-term perspective, and are\naware of our limitations, most particularly those imposed by our\nlarge capital base.\nThe unit trusts that have recently surfaced fly in the face of\nthese goals.\nThey would be sold by brokers working for big\ncommissions, would impose other burdensome costs on their\nshareholders, and would be marketed en masse to unsophisticated\nbuyers, apt to be seduced by our past record and beguiled by the\npublicity Berkshire and I have received in recent years.\nThe sure\noutcome:\na multitude of investors destined to be disappointed.\nThrough our creation of the B stock - a low-denomination\nproduct far superior to Berkshire-only trusts - we hope to make the\nclones unmerchandisable.\nBut both present and prospective Berkshire shareholders should\npay special attention to one point:\nThough the per-share intrinsic\nvalue of our stock has grown at an excellent rate during the past\nfive years, its market price has grown still faster.\nThe stock, in\nother words, has outperformed the business.\nThat kind of market overperformance cannot persist indefinitely,\nneither for Berkshire nor any other stock.\nInevitably, there\nwill be periods of underperformance as well.\nThe price\nvolatility that results, though endemic to public markets, is\nnot to our liking.\nWhat we would prefer instead is to have the\nmarket price of Berkshire precisely track its intrinsic value.\nWere the stock to do that, every shareholder would benefit during\nhis period of ownership in exact proportion to the progress\nBerkshire itself made in the period.\nObviously, the market behavior of Berkshire's stock will never\nconform to this ideal.\nBut we will come closer to this goal than\nwe would otherwise if our present and prospective shareholders are\ninformed, business-oriented and not exposed to high-commission\nsalesmanship when making their investment decisions.\nTo that end,\nwe are better off if we can blunt the merchandising efforts of the\nunit trusts - and that is the reason we are creating the B stock.\nWe look forward to answering your questions about the\nrecapitalization at the Annual Meeting.\nMiscellaneous\nBerkshire isn't the only American corporation utilizing the\nnew, exciting ABWA strategy.\nAt about 1:15 p.m. on July 14, 1995,\nMichael Eisner, CEO of The Walt Disney Company, was walking up\nWildflower Lane in Sun Valley.\nAt the same time, I was leaving a\nlunch at Herbert Allen's home on that street to meet Tom Murphy,\nCEO of Cap Cities/ABC, for a golf game.\nThat morning, speaking to a large group of executives and\nmoney managers assembled by Allen's investment bank, Michael had\nmade a brilliant presentation about Disney, and upon seeing him, I\noffered my congratulations.\nWe chatted briefly - and the subject\nof a possible combination of Disney and Cap Cities came up.\nThis\nwasn't the first time a merger had been discussed, but progress had\nnever before been made, in part because Disney wanted to buy with\ncash and Cap Cities desired stock.\nMichael and I waited a few minutes for Murph to arrive, and in\nthe short conversation that ensued, both Michael and Murph\nindicated they might bend on the stock/cash question.\nWithin a few\nweeks, they both did, at which point a contract was put together in\nthree very busy days.\nThe Disney/Cap Cities deal makes so much sense that I'm sure\nit would have occurred without that chance encounter in Sun Valley.\nBut when I ran into Michael that day on Wildflower Lane, he was\nheading for his plane, so without that accidental meeting the deal\ncertainly wouldn't have happened in the time frame it did.\nI\nbelieve both Disney and Cap Cities will benefit from the fact that\nwe all serendipitously met that day.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIt's appropriate that I say a few words here about Murph.\nTo\nput it simply, he is as fine an executive as I have ever seen in my\nlong exposure to business.\nEqually important, he possesses human\nqualities every bit the equal of his managerial qualities.\nHe's an\nextraordinary friend, parent, husband and citizen.\nIn those rare\ninstances in which Murph's personal interests diverged from those\nof shareholders, he unfailingly favored the owners.\nWhen I say\nthat I like to be associated with managers whom I would love to\nhave as a sibling, in-law, or trustee of my will, Murph is the\nexemplar of what I mean.\nIf Murph should elect to run another business, don't bother to\nstudy its value - just buy the stock.\nAnd don't later be as dumb\nas I was two years ago when I sold one-third of our holdings in Cap\nCities for $635 million (versus the $1.27 billion those shares\nwould bring in the Disney merger).\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAbout 96.3% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshire's\n1995 shareholder-designated contributions program.\nContributions\nmade were $11.6 million and 3,600 charities were recipients.\nA\nfull description of the shareholder-designated contributions\nprogram appears on pages 54-55.\nEvery year a few shareholders miss out on the program because\nthey don't have their shares registered in their own names on the\nprescribed record date or because they fail to get their\ndesignation form back to us within the 60-day period allowed.\nThat\nsecond problem pained me especially this year because two good\nfriends with substantial holdings missed the deadline.\nWe had to\ndeny their requests to be included because we can't make exceptions\nfor some shareholders while refusing to make them for others.\nTo participate in future programs, you must own Class A shares\nthat are registered in the name of the actual owner, not the\nnominee name of a broker, bank or depository.\nShares not so\nregistered on August 31, 1996, will be ineligible for the 1996\nprogram.\nWhen you get the form, return it promptly so that it does\nnot get put aside or forgotten.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nWhen it comes to our Annual Meetings, Charlie and I are\nmanagerial oddballs:\nWe thoroughly enjoy the event.\nSo come join\nus on Monday, May 6.\nAt Berkshire, we have no investor relations\ndepartment and don't use financial analysts as a channel for\ndisseminating information, earnings \"guidance,\" or the like.\nInstead, we prefer direct manager-to-owner communication and\nbelieve that the Annual Meeting is the ideal place for this\ninterchange of ideas.\nTalking to you there is efficient for us and\nalso democratic in that all present simultaneously hear what we\nhave to say.\nLast year, for the first time, we had the Annual Meeting at\nthe Holiday Convention Centre and the logistics seemed to work.\nThe ballroom there was filled with about 3,200 people, and we had a\nvideo feed into a second room holding another 800 people.\nSeating\nin the main room was a little tight, so this year we will probably\nconfigure it to hold 3,000.\nThis year we will also have two rooms\nfor the overflow.\nAll in all, we will be able to handle 5,000 shareholders.\nThe\nmeeting will start at 9:30 a.m., but be warned that last year the\nmain ballroom was filled shortly after 8:00 a.m.\nShareholders from 49 states attended our 1995 meeting - where\nwere you, Vermont? - and a number of foreign countries, including\nAustralia, Sweden and Germany, were represented.\nAs always, the\nmeeting attracted shareholders who were interested in Berkshire's\nbusiness - as contrasted to shareholders who are primarily\ninterested in themselves - and the questions were all good.\nCharlie and I ate lunch on stage and answered questions for about\nfive hours.\nWe feel that if owners come from all over the world, we should\ntry to make sure they have an opportunity to ask their questions.\nMost shareholders leave about noon, but a thousand or so hardcore\ntypes usually stay to see whether we will drop.\nCharlie and I are\nin training to last at least five hours again this year.\nWe will have our usual array of Berkshire products at the\nmeeting and this year will add a sales representative from GEICO.\nAt the 1995 meeting, we sold 747 pounds of candy, 759 pairs of\nshoes, and over $17,500 of World Books and related publications.\nIn a move that might have been dangerous had our stock been weak,\nwe added knives last year from our Quikut subsidiary and sold 400\nsets of these.\n(We draw the line at soft fruit, however.)\nAll of\nthese goods will again be available this year.\nWe don't consider a\ncultural event complete unless a little business is mixed in.\nBecause we expect a large crowd for the meeting, we recommend\nthat you promptly get both plane and hotel reservations.\nThose of\nyou who like to be downtown (about six miles from the Centre) may\nwish to stay at the Radisson Redick Tower, a small (88 rooms) but\nnice hotel, or at the much larger Red Lion Hotel a few blocks away.\nIn the vicinity of the Centre are the Holiday Inn (403 rooms),\nHomewood Suites (118 rooms) and Hampton Inn (136 rooms).\nAnother\nrecommended spot is the Marriott, whose west Omaha location is\nabout 100 yards from Borsheim's and a ten-minute drive from the\nCentre.\nThere will be buses at the Marriott that will leave at\n7:30, 8:00 and 8:30 for the meeting and return after it ends.\nAn attachment to our proxy material explains how you can\nobtain the card you will need for admission to the meeting.\nA\ngood-sized parking area is available at the Centre, while those who\nstay at the Holiday Inn, Homewood Suites and Hampton Inn will be\nable to walk to the meeting.\nAs usual, we will have buses to take\nyou to the Nebraska Furniture Mart and Borsheim's after the meeting\nand to take you from there to hotels or the airport later.\nNFM's main store, on its 64-acre site about two miles north of\nthe Centre, is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays, 10 a.m. to\n6 p.m. on Saturdays, and noon to 6 p.m. on Sundays.\nRose Blumkin -\n\"Mrs. B\" - is now 102, but will be hard at work in Mrs. B's\nWarehouse.\nShe was honored in November at the opening of The Rose,\na classic downtown theater of the 20's that has been magnificently\nrestored, but that would have been demolished had she not saved it.\nAsk her to tell you the story.\nBorsheim's normally is closed on Sunday but will be open for\nshareholders and their guests from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on May 5th.\nAdditionally, we will have a special opening for shareholders on\nSaturday, the 4th, from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.\nLast year, on\nShareholders Day, we wrote 1,733 tickets in the six hours we were\nopen - which is a sale every 13 seconds.\nRemember, though, that\nrecords are made to be broken.\nAt Borsheim's, we will also have the world's largest faceted\ndiamond on display.\nTwo years in the cutting, this inconspicuous\nbauble is 545 carats in size.\nPlease inspect this stone and let it\nguide you in determining what size gem is appropriate for the one\nyou love.\nOn Saturday evening, May 4, there will be a baseball game at\nRosenblatt Stadium between the Omaha Royals and the Louisville\nRedbirds.\nI expect to make the opening pitch - owning a quarter of\nthe team assures me of one start per year - but our manager, Mike\nJirschele, will probably make his usual mistake and yank me\nimmediately after.\nAbout 1,700 shareholders attended last year's\ngame.\nUnfortunately, we had a rain-out, which greatly disappointed\nthe many scouts in the stands.\nBut the smart ones will be back\nthis year, and I plan to show them my best stuff.\nOur proxy statement will include information about obtaining\ntickets to the game.\nWe will also offer an information packet this\nyear listing restaurants that will be open on Sunday night and\ndescribing various things that you can do in Omaha on the weekend.\nFor years, I've unsuccessfully tried to get my grade school\nclassmate, \"Pal\" Gorat, to open his steakhouse for business on the\nSunday evening preceding the meeting.\nBut this year he's relented.\nGorat's is a family-owned enterprise that has thrived for 52\nyears, and if you like steaks, you'll love this place. I've told\nPal he will get a good crowd, so call Gorat's at 402-551-3733 for a\nreservation.\nYou'll spot me there - I'll be the one eating the\nrare T-bone with a double order of hash browns.\nWarren E.

    "text": "Chairman's Letter - 1996\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nChairman's Letter\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOur gain in net worth during 1996 was $6.2 billion, or 36.1%.\nPer-\nshare book value, however, grew by less, 31.8%, because the number of\nBerkshire shares increased:\nWe issued stock in acquiring FlightSafety\nInternational and also sold new Class B shares.*\nOver the last 32 years\n(that is, since present management took over) per-share book value has\ngrown from $19 to $19,011, or at a rate of 23.8% compounded annually.\n* Each Class B share has an economic interest equal to 1/30th of\nthat possessed by a Class A share, which is the new designation for\nthe only stock that Berkshire had outstanding before May 1996.\nThroughout this report, we state all per-share figures in terms of\n\"Class A equivalents,\" which are the sum of the Class A shares\noutstanding and 1/30th of the Class B shares outstanding.\nFor technical reasons, we have restated our 1995 financial\nstatements, a matter that requires me to present one of my less-than-\nthrilling explanations of accounting arcana.\nI'll make it brief.\nThe restatement was required because GEICO became a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of Berkshire on January 2, 1996, whereas it was previously\nclassified as an investment.\nFrom an economic viewpoint - taking into\naccount major tax efficiencies and other benefits we gained - the value\nof the 51% of GEICO we owned at year-end 1995 increased significantly\nwhen we acquired the remaining 49% of the company two days later.\nAccounting rules applicable to this type of \"step acquisition,\" however,\nrequired us to write down the value of our 51% at the time we moved to\n100%.\nThat writedown - which also, of course, reduced book value -\namounted to $478.4 million.\nAs a result, we now carry our original 51%\nof GEICO at a value that is both lower than its market value at the time\nwe purchased the remaining 49% of the company and lower than the value at\nwhich we carry that 49% itself.\nThere is an offset, however, to the reduction in book value I have\njust described:\nTwice during 1996 we issued Berkshire shares at a\npremium to book value, first in May when we sold the B shares for cash\nand again in December when we used both A and B shares as part-payment\nfor FlightSafety.\nIn total, the three non-operational items affecting\nbook value contributed less than one percentage point to our 31.8% per-\nshare gain last year.\nI dwell on this rise in per-share book value because it roughly\nindicates our economic progress during the year.\nBut, as Charlie Munger,\nBerkshire's Vice Chairman, and I have repeatedly told you, what counts at\nBerkshire is intrinsic value, not book value.\nThe last time you got that\nmessage from us was in the Owner's Manual, sent to you in June after we\nissued the Class B shares.\nIn that manual, we not only defined certain\nkey terms - such as intrinsic value -\nbut also set forth our economic\nprinciples.\nFor many years, we have listed these principles in the front of our\nannual report, but in this report, on pages 58 to 67, we reproduce the\nentire Owner's Manual.\nIn this letter, we will occasionally refer to the\nmanual so that we can avoid repeating certain definitions and\nexplanations.\nFor example, if you wish to brush up on \"intrinsic value,\"\nsee pages 64 and 65.\nLast year, for the first time, we supplied you with a table that\nCharlie and I believe will help anyone trying to estimate Berkshire's\nintrinsic value.\nIn the updated version of that table, which follows, we\ntrace two key indices of value.\nThe first column lists our per-share\nownership of investments (including cash and equivalents) and the second\ncolumn shows our per-share earnings from Berkshire's operating businesses\nbefore taxes and purchase-accounting adjustments but after all interest\nand corporate overhead expenses.\nThe operating-earnings column excludes\nall dividends, interest and capital gains that we realized from the\ninvestments presented in the first column.\nIn effect, the two columns\nshow what Berkshire would have reported had it been broken into two parts.\nPre-tax Earnings Per Share\nInvestments\nExcluding All Income from\nYear\nPer Share\nInvestments\n----\n-----------\n-------------------------\n1965................................$\n4\n$\n4.08\n1975................................\n159\n(6.48)\n1985................................\t2,443\n18.86\n1995................................\n22,088\n258.20\n1996................................\n28,500\n421.39\nAnnual Growth Rate, 1965-95.........\t33.4%\n14.7%\nOne-Year Growth Rate, 1995-96 ......\t29.0%\n63.2%\nAs the table tells you, our investments per share increased in 1996\nby 29.0% and our non-investment earnings grew by 63.2%.\nOur goal is to\nkeep the numbers in both columns moving ahead at a reasonable (or, better\nyet, unreasonable) pace.\nOur expectations, however, are tempered by two realities.\nFirst,\nour past rates of growth cannot be matched nor even approached:\nBerkshire's equity capital is now large - in fact, fewer than ten\nbusinesses in America have capital larger -\nand an abundance of funds\ntends to dampen returns.\nSecond, whatever our rate of progress, it will\nnot be smooth:\nYear-to-year moves in the first column of the table above\nwill be influenced in a major way by fluctuations in securities markets;\nthe figures in the second column will be affected by wide swings in the\nprofitability of our catastrophe-reinsurance business.\nIn the table, the donations made pursuant to our shareholder-\ndesignated contributions program are charged against the second column,\nthough we view them as a shareholder benefit rather than as an expense.\nAll other corporate expenses are also charged against the second column.\nThese costs may be lower than those of any other large American\ncorporation:\nOur after-tax headquarters expense amounts to less than two\nbasis points (1/50th of 1%) measured against net worth.\nEven so, Charlie\nused to think this expense percentage outrageously high, blaming it on my\nuse of Berkshire's corporate jet, The Indefensible.\nBut Charlie has\nrecently experienced a \"counter-revelation\":\nWith our purchase of\nFlightSafety, whose major activity is the training of corporate pilots,\nhe now rhapsodizes at the mere mention of jets.\nSeriously, costs matter.\nFor example, equity mutual funds incur\ncorporate expenses - largely payments to the funds' managers - that\naverage about 100 basis points, a levy likely to cut the returns their\ninvestors earn by 10% or more over time.\nCharlie and I make no promises\nabout Berkshire's results.\nWe do promise you, however, that virtually\nall of the gains Berkshire makes will end up with shareholders.\nWe are\nhere to make money with you, not off you.\nThe Relationship of Intrinsic Value to Market Price\nIn last year's letter, with Berkshire shares selling at $36,000, I\ntold you:\n(1) Berkshire's gain in market value in recent years had\noutstripped its gain in intrinsic value, even though the latter gain had\nbeen highly satisfactory; (2) that kind of overperformance could not\ncontinue indefinitely; (3) Charlie and I did not at that moment consider\nBerkshire to be undervalued.\nSince I set down those cautions, Berkshire's intrinsic value has\nincreased very significantly - aided in a major way by a stunning\nperformance at GEICO that I will tell you more about later - while the\nmarket price of our shares has changed little.\nThis, of course, means\nthat in 1996 Berkshire's stock underperformed the business.\nConsequently, today's price/value relationship is both much different\nfrom what it was a year ago and, as Charlie and I see it, more\nappropriate.\nOver time, the aggregate gains made by Berkshire shareholders must\nof necessity match the business gains of the company.\nWhen the stock\ntemporarily overperforms or underperforms the business, a limited number\nof shareholders - either sellers or buyers - receive outsized benefits at\nthe expense of those they trade with.\nGenerally, the sophisticated have\nan edge over the innocents in this game.\nThough our primary goal is to maximize the amount that our\nshareholders, in total, reap from their ownership of Berkshire, we wish\nalso to minimize the benefits going to some shareholders at the expense\nof others.\nThese are goals we would have were we managing a family\npartnership, and we believe they make equal sense for the manager of a\npublic company.\nIn a partnership, fairness requires that partnership\ninterests be valued equitably when partners enter or exit; in a public\ncompany, fairness prevails when market price and intrinsic value are in\nsync.\nObviously, they won't always meet that ideal, but a manager - by\nhis policies and communications - can do much to foster equity.\nOf course, the longer a shareholder holds his shares, the more\nbearing Berkshire's business results will have on his financial\nexperience - and the less it will matter what premium or discount to\nintrinsic value prevails when he buys and sells his stock.\nThat's one\nreason we hope to attract owners with long-term horizons.\nOverall, I\nthink we have succeeded in that pursuit.\nBerkshire probably ranks number\none among large American corporations in the percentage of its shares\nheld by owners with a long-term view.\nAcquisitions of 1996\nWe made two acquisitions in 1996, both possessing exactly the\nqualities we seek - excellent business economics and an outstanding\nmanager.\nThe first acquisition was Kansas Bankers Surety (KBS), an insurance\ncompany whose name describes its specialty.\nThe company, which does\nbusiness in 22 states, has an extraordinary underwriting record, achieved\nthrough the efforts of Don Towle, an extraordinary manager.\nDon has\ndeveloped first-hand relationships with hundreds of bankers and knows\nevery detail of his operation.\nHe thinks of himself as running a company\nthat is \"his,\" an attitude we treasure at Berkshire.\nBecause of its\nrelatively small size, we placed KBS with Wesco, our 80%-owned\nsubsidiary, which has wanted to expand its insurance operations.\nYou might be interested in the carefully-crafted and sophisticated\nacquisition strategy that allowed Berkshire to nab this deal.\nEarly in\n1996 I was invited to the 40th birthday party of my nephew's wife, Jane\nRogers.\nMy taste for social events being low, I immediately, and in my\nstandard, gracious way, began to invent reasons for skipping the event.\nThe party planners then countered brilliantly by offering me a seat next\nto a man I always enjoy, Jane's dad, Roy Dinsdale - so I went.\nThe party took place on January 26.\nThough the music was loud - Why\nmust bands play as if they will be paid by the decibel? - I just managed\nto hear Roy say he'd come from a directors meeting at Kansas Bankers\nSurety, a company I'd always admired.\nI shouted back that he should let\nme know if it ever became available for purchase.\nOn February 12, I got the following letter from Roy:\n\"Dear Warren:\nEnclosed is the annual financial information on Kansas Bankers Surety.\nThis is the company that we talked about at Janie's party.\nIf I can be\nof any further help, please let me know.\"\nOn February 13, I told Roy we\nwould pay $75 million for the company - and before long we had a deal.\nI'm now scheming to get invited to Jane's next party.\nOur other acquisition in 1996 - FlightSafety International, the\nworld's leader in the training of pilots - was far larger, at about $1.5\nbillion, but had an equally serendipitous origin.\nThe heroes of this\nstory are first, Richard Sercer, a Tucson aviation consultant, and\nsecond, his wife, Alma Murphy, an ophthalmology graduate of Harvard\nMedical School, who in 1990 wore down her husband's reluctance and got\nhim to buy Berkshire stock.\nSince then, the two have attended all our\nAnnual Meetings, but I didn't get to know them personally.\nFortunately, Richard had also been a long-time shareholder of\nFlightSafety, and it occurred to him last year that the two companies\nwould make a good fit.\nHe knew our acquisition criteria, and he thought\nthat Al Ueltschi, FlightSafety's 79-year-old CEO, might want to make a\ndeal that would both give him a home for his company and a security in\npayment that he would feel comfortable owning throughout his lifetime.\nSo in July, Richard wrote Bob Denham, CEO of Salomon Inc, suggesting that\nhe explore the possibility of a merger.\nBob took it from there, and on September 18, Al and I met in New\nYork.\nI had long been familiar with FlightSafety's business, and in\nabout 60 seconds I knew that Al was exactly our kind of manager.\nA month\nlater, we had a contract.\nBecause Charlie and I wished to minimize the\nissuance of Berkshire shares, the transaction we structured gave\nFlightSafety shareholders a choice of cash or stock but carried terms\nthat encouraged those who were tax-indifferent to take cash.\nThis nudge\nled to about 51% of FlightSafety's shares being exchanged for cash, 41%\nfor Berkshire A and 8% for Berkshire B.\nAl has had a lifelong love affair with aviation and actually piloted\nCharles Lindbergh.\nAfter a barnstorming career in the 1930s, he began\nworking for Juan Trippe, Pan Am's legendary chief.\nIn 1951, while still\nat Pan Am, Al founded FlightSafety, subsequently building it into a\nsimulator manufacturer and a worldwide trainer of pilots (single-engine,\nhelicopter, jet and marine).\nThe company operates in 41 locations,\noutfitted with 175 simulators of planes ranging from the very small, such\nas Cessna 210s, to Boeing 747s.\nSimulators are not cheap - they can cost\nas much as $19 million\n- so this business, unlike many of our\noperations, is capital intensive.\nAbout half of the company's revenues\nare derived from the training of corporate pilots, with most of the\nbalance coming from airlines and the military.\nAl may be 79, but he looks and acts about 55.\nHe will run\noperations just as he has in the past:\nWe never fool with success.\nI\nhave told him that though we don't believe in splitting Berkshire stock,\nwe will split his age 2-for-1 when he hits 100.\nAn observer might conclude from our hiring practices that Charlie\nand I were traumatized early in life by an EEOC bulletin on age\ndiscrimination.\nThe real explanation, however, is self-interest:\nIt's\ndifficult to teach a new dog old tricks.\nThe many Berkshire managers who\nare past 70 hit home runs today at the same pace that long ago gave them\nreputations as young slugging sensations.\nTherefore, to get a job with\nus, just employ the tactic of the 76-year-old who persuaded a dazzling\nbeauty of 25 to marry him.\n\"How did you ever get her to accept?\" asked\nhis envious contemporaries.\nThe comeback:\n\"I told her I was 86.\"\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAnd now we pause for our usual commercial:\nIf you own a large\nbusiness with good economic characteristics and wish to become associated\nwith an exceptional collection of businesses having similar\ncharacteristics, Berkshire may well be the home you seek.\nOur\nrequirements are set forth on page 21.\nIf your company meets them - and\nif I fail to make the next birthday party you attend - give me a call.\nInsurance Operations - Overview\nOur insurance business was terrific in 1996.\nIn both primary\ninsurance, where GEICO is our main unit, and in our \"super-cat\"\nreinsurance business, results were outstanding.\nAs we've explained in past reports, what counts in our insurance\nbusiness is, first, the amount of \"float\" we generate and, second, its\ncost to us.\nThese are matters that are important for you to understand\nbecause float is a major component of Berkshire's intrinsic value that is\nnot reflected in book value.\nTo begin with, float is money we hold but don't own.\nIn an\ninsurance operation, float arises because premiums are received before\nlosses are paid.\nSecondly, the premiums that an insurer takes in\ntypically do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay.\nThat leaves it running an \"underwriting loss,\" which is the cost of\nfloat.\nAn insurance business has value if its cost of float over time is\nless than the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain funds.\nBut the business is an albatross if the cost of its float is higher than\nmarket rates for money.\nAs the numbers in the following table show, Berkshire's insurance\nbusiness has been a huge winner.\nFor the table, we have calculated our\nfloat -\nwhich we generate in large amounts relative to our premium\nvolume - by adding loss reserves, loss adjustment reserves, funds held\nunder reinsurance assumed and unearned premium reserves, and then\nsubtracting agents' balances, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid taxes\nand deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance.\nOur cost of\nfloat is determined by our underwriting loss or profit.\nIn those years\nwhen we have had an underwriting profit, such as the last four, our cost\nof float has been negative.\nIn effect, we have been paid for holding\nmoney.\n(1)\n(2)\nYearend Yield\nUnderwriting\nApproximat\non Long-Term\nLoss\nAverage Float\nCost of Funds\nGovt.

it's a certainty.\nThe\nonly question is when it will come.\nI emphasize this lugubrious point because I would not want you to\npanic and sell your Berkshire stock upon hearing that some large\ncatastrophe had cost us a significant amount.\nIf you would tend to react\nthat way, you should not own Berkshire shares now, just as you should\nentirely avoid owning stocks if a crashing market would lead you to panic\nand sell.\nSelling fine businesses on \"scary\" news is usually a bad\ndecision.\n(Robert Woodruff, the business genius who built Coca-Cola over\nmany decades and who owned a huge position in the company, was once asked\nwhen it might be a good time to sell Coke stock.\nWoodruff had a simple\nanswer:\n\"I don't know.\nI've never sold any.\")\nIn our super-cat operation, our customers are insurers that are\nexposed to major earnings volatility and that wish to reduce it.\nThe\nproduct we sell -\nfor what we hope is an appropriate price -\nis our\nwillingness to shift that volatility to our own books.\nGyrations in\nBerkshire's earnings don't bother us in the least:\nCharlie and I would\nmuch rather earn a lumpy 15% over time than a smooth 12%.\n(After all, our\nearnings swing wildly on a daily and weekly basis - why should we demand\nthat smoothness accompany each orbit that the earth makes of the sun?)\nWe\nare most comfortable with that thinking, however, when we have\nshareholder/partners who can also accept volatility, and that's why we\nregularly repeat our cautions.\nWe took on some major super-cat exposures during 1996.\nAt mid-year we\nwrote a contract with Allstate that covers Florida hurricanes, and though\nthere are no definitive records that would allow us to prove this point, we\nbelieve that to have then been the largest single catastrophe risk ever\nassumed by one company for its own account.\nLater in the year, however, we\nwrote a policy for the California Earthquake Authority that goes into\neffect on April 1, 1997, and that exposes us to a loss more than twice that\npossible under the Florida contract.\nAgain we retained all the risk for\nour own account.\nLarge as these coverages are, Berkshire's after-tax\n\"worst-case\" loss from a true mega-catastrophe is probably no more than\n$600 million, which is less than 3% of our book value and 1.5% of our market\nvalue.\nTo gain some perspective on this exposure, look at the table on\npage 2 and note the much greater volatility that security markets have\ndelivered us.\nIn the super-cat business, we have three major competitive advantages.\nFirst, the parties buying reinsurance from us know that we both can and\nwill pay under the most adverse of circumstances.\nWere a truly cataclysmic\ndisaster to occur, it is not impossible that a financial panic would\nquickly follow.\nIf that happened, there could well be respected reinsurers\nthat would have difficulty paying at just the moment that their clients\nfaced extraordinary needs. Indeed, one reason we never \"lay off\" part of\nthe risks we insure is that we have reservations about our ability to\ncollect from others when disaster strikes.\nWhen it's Berkshire promising,\ninsureds know with certainty that they can collect promptly.\nOur second advantage - somewhat related - is subtle but important.\nAfter a mega-catastrophe, insurers might well find it difficult to obtain\nreinsurance even though their need for coverage would then be particularly\ngreat.\nAt such a time, Berkshire would without question have very\nsubstantial capacity available - but it will naturally be our long-standing\nclients that have first call on it.\nThat business reality has made major\ninsurers and reinsurers throughout the world realize the desirability of\ndoing business with us.\nIndeed, we are currently getting sizable \"stand-\nby\" fees from reinsurers that are simply nailing down their ability to get\ncoverage from us should the market tighten.\nOur final competitive advantage is that we can provide dollar\ncoverages of a size neither matched nor approached elsewhere in the\nindustry.\nInsurers looking for huge covers know that a single call to\nBerkshire will produce a firm and immediate offering.\nA few facts about our exposure to California earthquakes - our largest\nrisk - seem in order.\nThe Northridge quake of 1994 laid homeowners' losses\non insurers that greatly exceeded what computer models had told them to\nexpect.\nYet the intensity of that quake was mild compared to the \"worst-\ncase\" possibility for California.\nUnderstandably, insurers became - ahem -\nshaken and started contemplating a retreat from writing earthquake coverage\ninto their homeowners' policies.\nIn a thoughtful response, Chuck Quackenbush, California's insurance\ncommissioner, designed a new residential earthquake policy to be written by\na state-sponsored insurer, The California Earthquake Authority.\nThis\nentity, which went into operation on December 1, 1996, needed large layers\nof reinsurance - and that's where we came in.\nBerkshire's layer of\napproximately $1 billion will be called upon if the Authority's aggregate\nlosses in the period ending March 31, 2001 exceed about $5 billion.\n(The\npress originally reported larger figures, but these would have applied only\nif all California insurers had entered into the arrangement; instead only\n72% signed up.)\nSo what are the true odds of our having to make a payout during the\npolicy's term?\nWe don't know - nor do we think computer models will help\nus, since we believe the precision they project is a chimera.\nIn fact,\nsuch models can lull decision-makers into a false sense of security and\nthereby increase their chances of making a really huge mistake.\nWe've\nalready seen such debacles in both insurance and investments.\nWitness\n\"portfolio insurance,\" whose destructive effects in the 1987 market crash\nled one wag to observe that it was the computers that should have been\njumping out of windows.\nEven if perfection in assessing risks is unattainable, insurers can\nunderwrite sensibly.\nAfter all, you need not know a man's precise age to\nknow that he is old enough to vote nor know his exact weight to recognize\nhis need to diet.\nIn insurance, it is essential to remember that virtually\nall surprises are unpleasant, and with that in mind we try to price our\nsuper-cat exposures so that about 90% of total premiums end up being\neventually paid out in losses and expenses.\nOver time, we will find out\nhow smart our pricing has been, but that will not be quickly.\nThe super-\ncat business is just like the investment business in that it often takes a\nlong time to find out whether you knew what you were doing.\nWhat I can state with certainty, however, is that we have the best\nperson in the world to run our super-cat business:\nAjit Jain, whose value\nto Berkshire is simply enormous.\nIn the reinsurance field, disastrous\npropositions abound.\nI know that because I personally embraced all too\nmany of these in the 1970s and also because GEICO has a large runoff\nportfolio made up of foolish contracts written in the early-1980s, able\nthough its then-management was.\nAjit, I can assure you, won't make\nmistakes of this type.\nI have mentioned that a mega-catastrophe might cause a catastrophe in\nthe financial markets, a possibility that is unlikely but not far-fetched.\nWere the catastrophe a quake in California of sufficient magnitude to tap\nour coverage, we would almost certainly be damaged in other ways as well.\nFor example, See's, Wells Fargo and Freddie Mac could be hit hard.\nAll in\nall, though, we can handle this aggregation of exposures.\nIn this respect, as in others, we try to \"reverse engineer\" our future\nat Berkshire, bearing in mind Charlie's dictum:\n\"All I want to know is\nwhere I'm going to die so I'll never go there.\"\n(Inverting really works:\nTry singing country western songs backwards and you will quickly regain\nyour house, your car and your wife.)\nIf we can't tolerate a possible\nconsequence, remote though it may be, we steer clear of planting its seeds.\nThat is why we don't borrow big amounts and why we make sure that our\nsuper-cat business losses, large though the maximums may sound, will not\nput a major dent in Berkshire's intrinsic value.\nInsurance - GEICO and Other Primary Operations\nWhen we moved to total ownership of GEICO early last year, our\nexpectations were high - and they are all being exceeded.\nThat is true\nfrom both a business and personal perspective:\nGEICO's operating chief,\nTony Nicely, is a superb business manager and a delight to work with.\nUnder almost any conditions, GEICO would be an exceptionally valuable\nasset.\nWith Tony at the helm, it is reaching levels of performance that\nthe organization would only a few years ago have thought impossible.\nThere's nothing esoteric about GEICO's success:\nThe company's\ncompetitive strength flows directly from its position as a low-cost\noperator.\nLow costs permit low prices, and low prices attract and retain\ngood policyholders.\nThe final segment of a virtuous circle is drawn when\npolicyholders recommend us to their friends.\nGEICO gets more than one\nmillion referrals annually and these produce more than half of our new\nbusiness,\nan advantage that gives us enormous savings in acquisition\nexpenses - and that makes our costs still lower.\nThis formula worked in spades for GEICO in 1996:\nIts voluntary auto\npolicy count grew 10%.\nDuring the previous 20 years, the company's best-\never growth for a year had been 8%, a rate achieved only once.\nBetter yet,\nthe growth in voluntary policies accelerated during the year, led by major\ngains in the nonstandard market, which has been an underdeveloped area at\nGEICO.\nI focus here on voluntary policies because the involuntary business\nwe get from assigned risk pools and the like is unprofitable.\nGrowth in\nthat sector is most unwelcome.\nGEICO's growth would mean nothing if it did not produce reasonable\nunderwriting profits.\nHere, too, the news is good:\nLast year we hit our\nunderwriting targets and then some.\nOur goal, however, is not to widen our\nprofit margin but rather to enlarge the price advantage we offer customers.\nGiven that strategy, we believe that 1997's growth will easily top that of\nlast year.\nWe expect new competitors to enter the direct-response market, and\nsome of our existing competitors are likely to expand geographically.\nNonetheless, the economies of scale we enjoy should allow us to maintain or\neven widen the protective moat surrounding our economic castle.\nWe do best\non costs in geographical areas in which we enjoy high market penetration.\nAs our policy count grows, concurrently delivering gains in penetration, we\nexpect to drive costs materially lower.\nGEICO's sustainable cost advantage\nis what attracted me to the company way back in 1951, when the entire\nbusiness was valued at $7 million.\nIt is also why I felt Berkshire should\npay $2.3 billion last year for the 49% of the company that we didn't then\nown.\nMaximizing the results of a wonderful business requires management and\nfocus.\nLucky for us, we have in Tony a superb manager whose business focus\nnever wavers.\nWanting also to get the entire GEICO organization\nconcentrating as he does, we needed a compensation plan that was itself\nsharply focused - and immediately after our purchase, we put one in.\nToday, the bonuses received by dozens of top executives, starting with\nTony, are based upon only two key variables:\n(1) growth in voluntary auto\npolicies and (2) underwriting profitability on \"seasoned\" auto business\n(meaning policies that have been on the books for more than one year).\nIn\naddition, we use the same yardsticks to calculate the annual contribution\nto the company's profit-sharing plan.\nEveryone at GEICO knows what counts.\nThe GEICO plan exemplifies Berkshire's incentive compensation\nprinciples:\nGoals should be (1) tailored to the economics of the specific\noperating business; (2) simple in character so that the degree to which\nthey are being realized can be easily measured; and (3) directly related to\nthe daily activities of plan participants.\nAs a corollary, we shun\n\"lottery ticket\" arrangements, such as options on Berkshire shares, whose\nultimate value - which could range from zero to huge - is totally out of\nthe control of the person whose behavior we would like to affect.\nIn our\nview, a system that produces quixotic payoffs will not only be wasteful for\nowners but may actually discourage the focused behavior we value in\nmanagers.\nEvery quarter, all 9,000 GEICO associates can see the results that\ndetermine our profit-sharing plan contribution.\nIn 1996, they enjoyed the\nexperience because the plan literally went off the chart that had been\nconstructed at the start of the year.\nEven I knew the answer to that\nproblem:\nEnlarge the chart.\nUltimately, the results called for a record\ncontribution of 16.9% ($40 million), compared to a five-year average of\nless than 10% for the comparable plans previously in effect.\nFurthermore,\nat Berkshire, we never greet good work by raising the bar.\nIf GEICO's\nperformance continues to improve, we will happily keep on making larger\ncharts.\nLou Simpson continues to manage GEICO's money in an outstanding\nmanner:\nLast year, the equities in his portfolio outdid the S&P 500 by 6.2\npercentage points.\nIn Lou's part of GEICO's operation, we again tie\ncompensation to performance - but to investment performance over a four-\nyear period, not to underwriting results nor to the performance of GEICO as\na whole.\nWe think it foolish for an insurance company to pay bonuses that\nare tied to overall corporate results when great work on one side of the\nbusiness - underwriting or investment - could conceivably be completely\nneutralized by bad work on the other.\nIf you bat .350 at Berkshire, you\ncan be sure you will get paid commensurately even if the rest of the team\nbats .200.\nIn Lou and Tony, however, we are lucky to have Hall-of-Famers\nin both key positions.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThough they are, of course, smaller than GEICO, our other primary\ninsurance operations turned in equally stunning results last year.\nNational Indemnity's traditional business had a combined ratio of 74.2 and,\nas usual, developed a large amount of float compared to premium volume.\nOver the last three years, this segment of our business, run by Don\nWurster, has had an average combined ratio of 83.0.\nOur homestate\noperation, managed by Rod Eldred, recorded a combined ratio of 87.1 even\nthough it absorbed the expenses of expanding to new states.\nRod's three-\nyear combined ratio is an amazing 83.2.\nBerkshire's workers' compensation\nbusiness, run out of California by Brad Kinstler, has now moved into six\nother states and, despite the costs of that expansion, again achieved an\nexcellent underwriting profit.\nFinally, John Kizer, at Central States\nIndemnity, set new records for premium volume while generating good\nearnings from underwriting.\nIn aggregate, our smaller insurance operations\n(now including Kansas Bankers Surety) have an underwriting record virtually\nunmatched in the industry.\nDon, Rod, Brad and John have all created\nsignificant value for Berkshire, and we believe there is more to come.\nTaxes\nIn 1961, President Kennedy said that we should ask not what our\ncountry can do for us, but rather ask what we can do for our country.\nLast\nyear we decided to give his suggestion a try - and who says it never hurts\nto ask?\nWe were told to mail $860 million in income taxes to the U.S.\nTreasury.\nHere's a little perspective on that figure:\nIf an equal amount had\nbeen paid by only 2,000 other taxpayers, the government would have had a\nbalanced budget in 1996 without needing a dime of taxes - income or Social\nSecurity or what have you - from any other American.\nBerkshire\nshareholders can truly say, \"I gave at the office.\"\nCharlie and I believe that large tax payments by Berkshire are\nentirely fitting.\nThe contribution we thus make to society's well-being is\nat most only proportional to its contribution to ours.\nBerkshire prospers\nin America as it would nowhere else.\nSources of Reported Earnings\nThe table that follows shows the main sources of Berkshire's reported\nearnings.\nIn this presentation, purchase-accounting adjustments are not\nassigned to the specific businesses to which they apply, but are instead\naggregated and shown separately.\nThis procedure lets you view the earnings\nof our businesses as they would have been reported had we not purchased\nthem.\nFor the reasons discussed on pages 65 and 66, this form of\npresentation seems to us to be more useful to investors and managers than\none utilizing generally-accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which\nrequire purchase-premiums to be charged off business-by-business.\nThe\ntotal earnings we show in the table are, of course, identical to the GAAP\ntotal in our audited financial statements.\n(in millions)\n--------------------------------------\nBerkshire's Share\nof Net Earnings\n(after taxes and\nPre-tax Earnings\nminority interests)\n----------------\n-------------------\n1996\n1995(1)\n1996\n1995(1)\n-------\n--------\n-------\n-------\nOperating Earnings:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting.....................$ 222.1\n$\n20.5\n$ 142.8\n$ 11.3\nNet Investment Income............\n726.2\n501.6\n593.1\n417.7\nBuffalo News...........................\n50.4\n46.8\n29.5\n27.3\nFechheimer.............................\n17.3\n16.9\n9.3\n8.8\nFinance Businesses.....................\n23.1\n20.8\n14.9\n12.6\nHome Furnishings.......................\n43.8\n29.7(2)\n24.8\n16.7(2)\nJewelry................................\n27.8\n33.9(3)\n16.1\n19.1(3)\nKirby..................................\n58.5\n50.2\n39.9\n32.1\nScott Fetzer Manufacturing Group.......\n50.6\n34.1\n32.2\n21.2\nSee's Candies..........................\n51.9\n50.2\n30.8\n29.8\nShoe Group.............................\n61.6\n58.4\n41.0\n37.5\nWorld Book.............................\n12.6\n8.8\n9.5\n7.0\nPurchase-Accounting Adjustments........\n(75.7)\n(27.0)\n(70.5)\n(23.4)\nInterest Expense(4)....................\n(94.3)\n(56.0)\n(56.6)\n(34.9)\nShareholder-Designated Contributions...\n(13.3)\n(11.6)\n(8.5)\n(7.0)\nOther..................................\n58.8\n37.4\n34.8\n24.4\n-------\n--------\n--------\n-------\nOperating Earnings.......................1,221.4\n814.7\n883.1\n600.2\nSales of Securities......................2,484.5\n194.1\n1,605.5\n125.0\n-------\n--------\n--------\n-------\nTotal Earnings -

Group and World Book.\nAll, I'm\nhappy to say, recorded gains in 1996.\nWorld Book, however, did not find it easy:\nDespite the operation's\nnew status as the only direct-seller of encyclopedias in the country\n(Encyclopedia Britannica exited the field last year), its unit volume fell.\nAdditionally, World Book spent heavily on a new CD-ROM product that began\nto take in revenues only in early 1997, when it was launched in association\nwith IBM.\nIn the face of these factors, earnings would have evaporated had\nWorld Book not revamped distribution methods and cut overhead at\nheadquarters, thereby dramatically reducing its fixed costs.\nOverall, the\ncompany has gone a long way toward assuring its long-term viability in both\nthe print and electronic marketplaces.\nOur only disappointment last year was in jewelry:\nBorsheim's did\nfine, but Helzberg's suffered a material decline in earnings.\nIts expense\nlevels had been geared to a sizable increase in same-store sales,\nconsistent with the gains achieved in recent years.\nWhen sales were\ninstead flat, profit margins fell.\nJeff Comment, CEO of Helzberg's, is\naddressing the expense problem in a decisive manner, and the company's\nearnings should improve in 1997.\nOverall, our operating businesses continue to perform exceptionally,\nfar outdoing their industry norms.\nFor this, Charlie and I thank our\nmanagers.\nIf you should see any of them at the Annual Meeting, add your\nthanks as well.\nMore information about our various businesses is given on pages 36-\n46, where you will also find our segment earnings reported on a GAAP\nbasis.\nIn addition, on pages 51-57, we have rearranged Berkshire's\nfinancial data into four segments on a non-GAAP basis, a presentation\nthat corresponds to the way Charlie and I think about the company.\nOur\nintent is to supply you with the financial information that we would wish\nyou to give us if our positions were reversed.\n\"Look-Through\" Earnings\nReported earnings are a poor measure of economic progress at\nBerkshire, in part because the numbers shown in the table presented\nearlier include only the dividends we receive from investees - though\nthese dividends typically represent only a small fraction of the earnings\nattributable to our ownership.\nNot that we mind this division of money,\nsince on balance we regard the undistributed earnings of investees as\nmore valuable to us than the portion paid out.\nThe reason is simple:\nOur investees often have the opportunity to reinvest earnings at high\nrates of return.\nSo why should we want them paid out?\nTo depict something closer to economic reality at Berkshire than\nreported earnings, though, we employ the concept of \"look-through\"\nearnings.\nAs we calculate these, they consist of: (1) the operating\nearnings reported in the previous section, plus; (2) our share of the\nretained operating earnings of major investees that, under GAAP\naccounting, are not reflected in our profits, less; (3) an allowance for\nthe tax that would be paid by Berkshire if these retained earnings of\ninvestees had instead been distributed to us.\nWhen tabulating \"operating\nearnings\" here, we exclude purchase-accounting adjustments as well as\ncapital gains and other major non-recurring items.\nThe following table sets forth our 1996 look-through earnings,\nthough I warn you that the figures can be no more than approximate, since\nthey are based on a number of judgment calls.\n(The dividends paid to us\nby these investees have been included in the operating earnings itemized\non page 12, mostly under \"Insurance Group:\nNet Investment Income.\")\nBerkshire's Share\nof Undistributed\nBerkshire's Approximate\nOperating Earnings\nBerkshire's

Stocks................$7,910.2\n$27,750.6\n========\n=========\n* Represents tax-basis cost which, in aggregate, is $1.2 billion\nless than GAAP cost.\nOur portfolio shows little change:\nWe continue to make more money\nwhen snoring than when active.\nInactivity strikes us as intelligent behavior.\nNeither we nor most\nbusiness managers would dream of feverishly trading highly-profitable\nsubsidiaries because a small move in the Federal Reserve's discount rate\nwas predicted or because some Wall Street pundit had reversed his views\non the market.\nWhy, then, should we behave differently with our minority\npositions in wonderful businesses?\nThe art of investing in public\ncompanies successfully is little different from the art of successfully\nacquiring subsidiaries.\nIn each case you simply want to acquire, at a\nsensible price, a business with excellent economics and able, honest\nmanagement.\nThereafter, you need only monitor whether these qualities\nare being preserved.\nWhen carried out capably, an investment strategy of that type will\noften result in its practitioner owning a few securities that will come\nto represent a very large portion of his portfolio.\nThis investor would\nget a similar result if he followed a policy of purchasing an interest\nin, say, 20% of the future earnings of a number of outstanding college\nbasketball stars.\nA handful of these would go on to achieve NBA stardom,\nand the investor's take from them would soon dominate his royalty stream.\nTo suggest that this investor should sell off portions of his most\nsuccessful investments simply because they have come to dominate his\nportfolio is akin to suggesting that the Bulls trade Michael Jordan\nbecause he has become so important to the team.\nIn studying the investments we have made in both subsidiary\ncompanies and common stocks, you will see that we favor businesses and\nindustries unlikely to experience major change.\nThe reason for that is\nsimple:\nMaking either type of purchase, we are searching for operations\nthat we believe are virtually certain to possess enormous competitive\nstrength ten or twenty years from now.\nA fast-changing industry\nenvironment may offer the chance for huge wins, but it precludes the\ncertainty we seek.\nI should emphasize that, as citizens, Charlie and I welcome change:\nFresh ideas, new products, innovative processes and the like cause our\ncountry's standard of living to rise, and that's clearly good.\nAs\ninvestors, however, our reaction to a fermenting industry is much like\nour attitude toward space exploration:\nWe applaud the endeavor but\nprefer to skip the ride.\nObviously all businesses change to some extent.\nToday, See's is\ndifferent in many ways from what it was in 1972 when we bought it:\nIt\noffers a different assortment of candy, employs different machinery and\nsells through different distribution channels.\nBut the reasons why\npeople today buy boxed chocolates, and why they buy them from us rather\nthan from someone else, are virtually unchanged from what they were in\nthe 1920s when the See family was building the business.\nMoreover, these\nmotivations are not likely to change over the next 20 years, or even 50.\nWe look for similar predictability in marketable securities.\nTake\nCoca-Cola:\nThe zeal and imagination with which Coke products are sold\nhas burgeoned under Roberto Goizueta, who has done an absolutely\nincredible job in creating value for his shareholders.\nAided by Don\nKeough and Doug Ivester, Roberto has rethought and improved every aspect\nof the company.\nBut the fundamentals of the business - the qualities\nthat underlie Coke's competitive dominance and stunning economics - have\nremained constant through the years.\nI was recently studying the 1896 report of Coke (and you think that\nyou are behind in your reading!).\nAt that time Coke, though it was\nalready the leading soft drink, had been around for only a decade.\nBut\nits blueprint for the next 100 years was already drawn.\nReporting sales\nof $148,000 that year, Asa Candler, the company's president, said:\n\"We\nhave not lagged in our efforts to go into all the world teaching that\nCoca-Cola is the article, par excellence, for the health and good feeling\nof all people.\"\nThough \"health\" may have been a reach, I love the fact\nthat Coke still relies on Candler's basic theme today - a century later.\nCandler went on to say, just as Roberto could now, \"No article of like\ncharacter has ever so firmly entrenched itself in public favor.\"\nSales\nof syrup that year, incidentally, were 116,492 gallons versus about 3.2\nbillion in 1996.\nI can't resist one more Candler quote:\n\"Beginning this year about\nMarch 1st . . . we employed ten traveling salesmen by means of which,\nwith systematic correspondence from the office, we covered almost the\nterritory of the Union.\"\nThat's my kind of sales force.\nCompanies such as Coca-Cola and Gillette might well be labeled \"The\nInevitables.\"\nForecasters may differ a bit in their predictions of\nexactly how much soft drink or shaving-equipment business these companies\nwill be doing in ten or twenty years.\nNor is our talk of inevitability\nmeant to play down the vital work that these companies must continue to\ncarry out, in such areas as manufacturing, distribution, packaging and\nproduct innovation.\nIn the end, however, no sensible observer - not even\nthese companies' most vigorous competitors, assuming they are assessing\nthe matter honestly - questions that Coke and Gillette will dominate\ntheir fields worldwide for an investment lifetime.\nIndeed, their\ndominance will probably strengthen.\nBoth companies have significantly\nexpanded their already huge shares of market during the past ten years,\nand all signs point to their repeating that performance in the next\ndecade.\nObviously many companies in high-tech businesses or embryonic\nindustries will grow much faster in percentage terms than will The\nInevitables.\nBut I would rather be certain of a good result than hopeful\nof a great one.\nOf course, Charlie and I can identify only a few Inevitables, even\nafter a lifetime of looking for them.\nLeadership alone provides no\ncertainties:\nWitness the shocks some years back at General Motors, IBM\nand Sears, all of which had enjoyed long periods of seeming\ninvincibility.\nThough some industries or lines of business exhibit\ncharacteristics that endow leaders with virtually insurmountable\nadvantages, and that tend to establish Survival of the Fattest as almost\na natural law, most do not.\nThus, for every Inevitable, there are dozens\nof Impostors, companies now riding high but vulnerable to competitive\nattacks.\nConsidering what it takes to be an Inevitable, Charlie and I\nrecognize that we will never be able to come up with a Nifty Fifty or\neven a Twinkling Twenty.\nTo the Inevitables in our portfolio, therefore,\nwe add a few \"Highly Probables.\"\nYou can, of course, pay too much for even the best of businesses.\nThe overpayment risk surfaces periodically and, in our opinion, may now\nbe quite high for the purchasers of virtually all stocks, The Inevitables\nincluded.\nInvestors making purchases in an overheated market need to\nrecognize that it may often take an extended period for the value of even\nan outstanding company to catch up with the price they paid.\nA far more serious problem occurs when the management of a great\ncompany gets sidetracked and neglects its wonderful base business while\npurchasing other businesses that are so-so or worse.\nWhen that happens,\nthe suffering of investors is often prolonged.\nUnfortunately, that is\nprecisely what transpired years ago at both Coke and Gillette.\n(Would\nyou believe that a few decades back they were growing shrimp at Coke and\nexploring for oil at Gillette?)\nLoss of focus is what most worries\nCharlie and me when we contemplate investing in businesses that in\ngeneral look outstanding.\nAll too often, we've seen value stagnate in\nthe presence of hubris or of boredom that caused the attention of\nmanagers to wander.\nThat's not going to happen again at Coke and\nGillette, however - not given their current and prospective managements.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nLet me add a few thoughts about your own investments.\nMost\ninvestors, both institutional and individual, will find that the best way\nto own common stocks is through an index fund that charges minimal fees.\nThose following this path are sure to beat the net results (after fees\nand expenses) delivered by the great majority of investment\nprofessionals.\nShould you choose, however, to construct your own portfolio, there\nare a few thoughts worth remembering.\nIntelligent investing is not\ncomplex, though that is far from saying that it is easy.\nWhat an\ninvestor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected businesses.\nNote that word \"selected\":\nYou don't have to be an expert on every\ncompany, or even many.\nYou only have to be able to evaluate companies\nwithin your circle of competence.\nThe size of that circle is not very\nimportant; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital.\nTo invest successfully, you need not understand beta, efficient\nmarkets, modern portfolio theory, option pricing or emerging markets.\nYou may, in fact, be better off knowing nothing of these.\nThat, of\ncourse, is not the prevailing view at most business schools, whose\nfinance curriculum tends to be dominated by such subjects.\nIn our view,\nthough, investment students need only two well-taught courses - How to\nValue a Business, and How to Think About Market Prices.\nYour goal as an investor should simply be to purchase, at a rational\nprice, a part interest in an easily-understandable business whose\nearnings are virtually certain to be materially higher five, ten and\ntwenty years from now.\nOver time, you will find only a few companies\nthat meet these standards - so when you see one that qualifies, you\nshould buy a meaningful amount of stock.\nYou must also resist the\ntemptation to stray from your guidelines:\nIf you aren't willing to own a\nstock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes.\nPut together a portfolio of companies whose aggregate earnings march\nupward over the years, and so also will the portfolio's market value.\nThough it's seldom recognized, this is the exact approach that has\nproduced gains for Berkshire shareholders:\nOur look-through earnings\nhave grown at a good clip over the years, and our stock price has risen\ncorrespondingly.\nHad those gains in earnings not materialized, there\nwould have been little increase in Berkshire's value.\nThe greatly enlarged earnings base we now enjoy will inevitably\ncause our future gains to lag those of the past.\nWe will continue,\nhowever, to push in the directions we always have.\nWe will try to build\nearnings by running our present businesses well - a job made easy because\nof the extraordinary talents of our operating managers - and by\npurchasing other businesses, in whole or in part, that are not likely to\nbe roiled by change and that possess important competitive advantages.\nUSAir\nWhen Richard Branson, the wealthy owner of Virgin Atlantic Airways,\nwas asked how to become a millionaire, he had a quick answer:\n\"There's\nreally nothing to it.\nStart as a billionaire and then buy an airline.\"\nUnwilling to accept Branson's proposition on faith, your Chairman decided\nin 1989 to test it by investing $358 million in a 9.25% preferred stock of\nUSAir.\nI liked and admired Ed Colodny, the company's then-CEO, and I still\ndo.\nBut my analysis of USAir's business was both superficial and wrong.\nI was so beguiled by the company's long history of profitable\noperations, and by the protection that ownership of a senior security\nseemingly offered me, that I overlooked the crucial point:\nUSAir's\nrevenues would increasingly feel the effects of an unregulated, fiercely-\ncompetitive market whereas its cost structure was a holdover from the\ndays when regulation protected profits.\nThese costs, if left unchecked,\nportended disaster, however reassuring the airline's past record might\nbe.\n(If history supplied all of the answers, the Forbes 400 would\nconsist of librarians.)\nTo rationalize its costs, however, USAir needed major improvements\nin its labor contracts - and that's something most airlines have found it\nextraordinarily difficult to get, short of credibly threatening, or\nactually entering, bankruptcy.\nUSAir was to be no exception.\nImmediately after we purchased our preferred stock, the imbalance between\nthe company's costs and revenues began to grow explosively.\nIn the 1990-\n1994 period, USAir lost an aggregate of $2.4 billion, a performance that\ntotally wiped out the book equity of its common stock.\nFor much of this period, the company paid us our preferred\ndividends, but in 1994 payment was suspended.\nA bit later, with the\nsituation looking particularly gloomy, we wrote down our investment by\n75%, to $89.5 million.\nThereafter, during much of 1995, I offered to\nsell our shares at 50% of face value.\nFortunately, I was unsuccessful.\nMixed in with my many mistakes at USAir was one thing I got right:\nMaking our investment, we wrote into the preferred contract a somewhat\nunusual provision stipulating that \"penalty dividends\" - to run five\npercentage points over the prime rate - would be accrued on any\narrearages.\nThis meant that when our 9.25% dividend was omitted for two\nyears, the unpaid amounts compounded at rates ranging between 13.25% and\n14%.\nFacing this penalty provision, USAir had every incentive to pay\narrearages just as promptly as it could.\nAnd in the second half of 1996,\nwhen USAir turned profitable, it indeed began to pay, giving us $47.9\nmillion.\nWe owe Stephen Wolf, the company's CEO, a huge thank-you for\nextracting a performance from the airline that permitted this payment.\nEven so, USAir's performance has recently been helped significantly by an\nindustry tailwind that may be cyclical in nature.\nThe company still has\nbasic cost problems that must be solved.\nIn any event, the prices of USAir's publicly-traded securities tell\nus that our preferred stock is now probably worth its par value of $358\nmillion, give or take a little.\nIn addition, we have over the years\ncollected an aggregate of $240.5 million in dividends (including $30\nmillion received in 1997).\nEarly in 1996, before any accrued dividends had been paid, I tried\nonce more to unload our holdings - this time for about $335 million.\nYou're lucky:\nI again failed in my attempt to snatch defeat from the\njaws of victory.\nIn another context, a friend once asked me:\n\"If you're so rich, why\naren't you smart?\"\nAfter reviewing my sorry performance with USAir, you\nmay conclude he had a point.\nFinancings\nWe wrote four checks to Salomon Brothers last year and in each case\nwere delighted with the work for which we were paying.\nI've already\ndescribed one transaction: the FlightSafety purchase in which Salomon was\nthe initiating investment banker.\nIn a second deal, the firm placed a\nsmall debt offering for our finance subsidiary.\nAdditionally, we made two good-sized offerings through Salomon, both\nwith interesting aspects.\nThe first was our sale in May of 517,500\nshares of Class B Common, which generated net proceeds of $565 million.\nAs I have told you before, we made this sale in response to the\nthreatened creation of unit trusts that would have marketed themselves as\nBerkshire look-alikes.\nIn the process, they would have used our past,\nand definitely nonrepeatable, record to entice naive small investors and\nwould have charged these innocents high fees and commissions.\nI think it would have been quite easy for such trusts to have sold\nmany billions of dollars worth of units, and I also believe that early\nmarketing successes by these trusts would have led to the formation of\nothers.\n(In the securities business, whatever can be sold will be sold.)\nThe trusts would have meanwhile indiscriminately poured the proceeds of\ntheir offerings into a supply of Berkshire shares that is fixed and\nlimited.\nThe likely result: a speculative bubble in our stock.\nFor at\nleast a time, the price jump would have been self-validating, in that it\nwould have pulled new waves of naive and impressionable investors into\nthe trusts and set off still more buying of Berkshire shares.\nSome Berkshire shareholders choosing to exit might have found that\noutcome ideal, since they could have profited at the expense of the\nbuyers entering with false hopes.\nContinuing shareholders, however,\nwould have suffered once reality set in, for at that point Berkshire\nwould have been burdened with both hundreds of thousands of unhappy,\nindirect owners (trustholders, that is) and a stained reputation.\nOur issuance of the B shares not only arrested the sale of the\ntrusts, but provided a low-cost way for people to invest in Berkshire if\nthey still wished to after hearing the warnings we issued.\nTo blunt the\nenthusiasm that brokers normally have for pushing new issues - because\nthat's where the money is - we arranged for our offering to carry a\ncommission of only 1.5%, the lowest payoff that we have ever seen in a\ncommon stock underwriting.\nAdditionally, we made the amount of the\noffering open-ended, thereby repelling the typical IPO buyer who looks\nfor a short-term price spurt arising from a combination of hype and\nscarcity.\nOverall, we tried to make sure that the B stock would be purchased\nonly by investors with a long-term perspective.\nThose efforts were\ngenerally successful:\nTrading volume in the B shares immediately\nfollowing the offering - a rough index of \"flipping\" - was far below the\nnorm for a new issue.\nIn the end we added about 40,000 shareholders,\nmost of whom we believe both understand what they own and share our time\nhorizons.\nSalomon could not have performed better in the handling of this\nunusual transaction.\nIts investment bankers understood perfectly what we\nwere trying to achieve and tailored every aspect of the offering to meet\nthese objectives.\nThe firm would have made far more money - perhaps ten\ntimes as much - if our offering had been standard in its make-up.\nBut\nthe investment bankers involved made no attempt to tweak the specifics in\nthat direction.\nInstead they came up with ideas that were counter to\nSalomon's financial interest but that made it much more certain\nBerkshire's goals would be reached.\nTerry Fitzgerald captained this\neffort, and we thank him for the job that he did.\nGiven that background, it won't surprise you to learn that we again\nwent to Terry when we decided late in the year to sell an issue of\nBerkshire notes that can be exchanged for a portion of the Salomon shares\nthat we hold.\nIn this instance, once again, Salomon did an absolutely\nfirst-class job, selling $500 million principal amount of five-year notes\nfor $447.1 million.\nEach $1,000 note is exchangeable into 17.65 shares\nand is callable in three years at accreted value.\nCounting the original\nissue discount and a 1% coupon, the securities will provide a yield of 3%\nto maturity for holders who do not exchange them for Salomon stock.\nBut\nit seems quite likely that the notes will be exchanged before their\nmaturity.\nIf that happens, our interest cost will be about 1.1% for the\nperiod prior to exchange.\nIn recent years, it has been written that Charlie and I are unhappy\nabout all investment-banking fees.\nThat's dead wrong.\nWe have paid a\ngreat many fees over the last 30 years - beginning with the check we\nwrote to Charlie Heider upon our purchase of National Indemnity in 1967 -\nand we are delighted to make payments that are commensurate with\nperformance.\nIn the case of the 1996 transactions at Salomon Brothers,\nwe more than got our money's worth.\nMiscellaneous\nThough it was a close decision, Charlie and I have decided to enter\nthe 20th Century.\nAccordingly, we are going to put future quarterly and\nannual reports of Berkshire on the Internet, where they can be accessed\nvia http://www.berkshirehathaway.com.\nWe will always \"post\" these\nreports on a Saturday so that anyone interested will have ample time to\ndigest the information before trading begins.\nOur publishing schedule\nfor the next 12 months is May 17, 1997, August 16, 1997, November 15,\n1997, and March 14, 1998.\nWe will also post any press releases that we\nissue.\nAt some point, we may stop mailing our quarterly reports and simply\npost these on the Internet.\nThis move would eliminate significant costs.\nAlso, we have a large number of \"street name\" holders and have found\nthat the distribution of our quarterlies to them is highly erratic:\nSome\nholders receive their mailings weeks later than others.\nThe drawback to Internet-only distribution is that many of our\nshareholders lack computers.\nMost of these holders, however, could\neasily obtain printouts at work or through friends.\nPlease let me know\nif you prefer that we continue mailing quarterlies.\nWe want your input -\nstarting with whether you even read these reports - and at a minimum will\nmake no change in 1997.\nAlso, we will definitely keep delivering the\nannual report in its present form in addition to publishing it on the\nInternet.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAbout 97.2% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshire's 1996\nshareholder-designated contributions program.\nContributions made were\n$13.3 million, and 3,910 charities were recipients.\nA full description\nof the shareholder-designated contributions program appears on pages 48-\n49.\nEvery year a few shareholders miss out on the program because they\ndon't have their shares registered in their own names on the prescribed\nrecord date or because they fail to get the designation form back to us\nwithin the 60-day period allowed.\nThis is distressing to Charlie and me.\nBut if replies are received late, we have to reject them because we\ncan't make exceptions for some shareholders while refusing to make them\nfor others.\nTo participate in future programs, you must own Class A shares that\nare registered in the name of the actual owner, not the nominee name of a\nbroker, bank or depository.\nShares not so registered on August 31, 1997,\nwill be ineligible for the 1997 program.\nWhen you get the form, return\nit promptly so that it does not get put aside or forgotten.\nThe Annual Meeting\nOur capitalist's version of Woodstock -the Berkshire Annual Meeting-\nwill be held on Monday, May 5.\nCharlie and I thoroughly enjoy this\nevent, and we hope that you come.\nWe will start at 9:30 a.m., break for\nabout 15 minutes at noon (food will be available - but at a price, of\ncourse), and then continue talking to hard-core attendees until at least\n3:30.\nLast year we had representatives from all 50 states, as well as\nAustralia, Greece, Israel, Portugal, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, and\nthe United Kingdom.\nThe annual meeting is a time for owners to get their\nbusiness-related questions answered, and therefore Charlie and I will\nstay on stage until we start getting punchy.\n(When that happens, I hope\nyou notice a change.)\nLast year we had attendance of 5,000 and strained the capacity of\nthe Holiday Convention Centre, even though we spread out over three\nrooms.\nThis year, our new Class B shares have caused a doubling of our\nstockholder count, and we are therefore moving the meeting to the\nAksarben Coliseum, which holds about 10,000 and also has a huge parking\nlot.\nThe doors will open for the meeting at 7:00 a.m., and at 8:30 we\nwill - upon popular demand - show a new Berkshire movie produced by Marc\nHamburg, our CFO.\n(In this company, no one gets by with doing only a\nsingle job.)\nOvercoming our legendary repugnance for activities even faintly\ncommercial, we will also have an abundant array of Berkshire products for\nsale in the halls outside the meeting room.\nLast year we broke all\nrecords, selling 1,270 pounds of See's candy, 1,143 pairs of Dexter\nshoes, $29,000 of World Books and related publications, and 700 sets of\nknives manufactured by our Quikut subsidiary.\nAdditionally, many\nshareholders made inquiries about GEICO auto policies.\nIf you would like\nto investigate possible insurance savings, bring your present policy to\nthe meeting.\nWe estimate that about 40% of our shareholders can save\nmoney by insuring with us.\n(We'd like to say 100%, but the insurance\nbusiness doesn't work that way:\nBecause insurers differ in their\nunderwriting judgments, some of our shareholders are currently paying\nrates that are lower than GEICO's.)\nAn attachment to the proxy material enclosed with this report\nexplains how you can obtain the card you will need for admission to the\nmeeting.\nWe expect a large crowd, so get both plane and hotel\nreservations promptly.\nAmerican Express (800-799-6634) will be happy to\nhelp you with arrangements.\nAs usual, we will have buses servicing the\nlarger hotels to take you to and from the meeting, and also to take you\nto Nebraska Furniture Mart, Borsheim's and the airport after it is over.\nNFM's main store, located on a 75-acre site about a mile from\nAksarben, is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.\non Saturdays, and noon to 6 p.m. on Sundays.\nCome by and say hello to\n\"Mrs. B\" (Rose Blumkin).\nShe's 103 now and sometimes operates with an\noxygen mask that is attached to a tank on her cart.\nBut if you try to\nkeep pace with her, it will be you who needs oxygen.\nNFM did about $265\nmillion of business last year - a record for a single-location home\nfurnishings operation - and you'll see why once you check out its\nmerchandise and prices.\nBorsheim's normally is closed on Sunday but will be open for\nshareholders from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on May 4th.\nLast year on\n\"Shareholder Sunday\" we broke every Borsheim's record in terms of\ntickets, dollar volume and, no doubt, attendees per square inch.\nBecause\nwe expect a capacity crowd this year as well, all shareholders attending\non Sunday must bring their admission cards.\nShareholders who prefer a\nsomewhat less frenzied experience will get the same special treatment on\nSaturday, when the store is open from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., or on Monday\nbetween 10 a.m. and 8 p.m.\nCome by at any time this year and let Susan\nJacques, Borsheim's CEO, and her skilled associates perform a painless\nwalletectomy on you.\nMy favorite steakhouse, Gorat's, was sold out last year on the\nweekend of the annual meeting, even though it added an additional seating\nat 4 p.m. on Sunday.\nYou can make reservations beginning on April 1st\n(but not earlier) by calling 402-551-3733.\nI will be at Gorat's on\nSunday after Borsheim's, having my usual rare T-bone and double order of\nhashbrowns.\nI can also recommend - this is the standard fare when Debbie\nBosanek, my invaluable assistant, and I go to lunch - the hot roast beef\nsandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy.\nMention Debbie's name and you\nwill be given an extra boat of gravy.\nThe Omaha Royals and Indianapolis Indians will play baseball on\nSaturday evening, May 3rd, at Rosenblatt Stadium.\nPitching in my normal\nrotation - one throw a year - I will start.\nThough Rosenblatt is normal in appearance, it is anything but:\nThe\nfield sits on a unique geological structure that occasionally emits short\ngravitational waves causing even the most smoothly-delivered pitch to\nsink violently.\nI have been the victim of this weird phenomenon several\ntimes in the past but am hoping for benign conditions this year.\nThere\nwill be lots of opportunities for photos at the ball game, but you will\nneed incredibly fast reflexes to snap my fast ball en route to the plate.\nOur proxy statement includes information about obtaining tickets to\nthe game.\nWe will also provide an information packet listing restaurants\nthat will be open on Sunday night and describing various things that you\ncan do in Omaha on the weekend.\nThe entire gang at Berkshire looks\nforward to seeing you.\nWarren E.

    "text": "1997 Chairman's Letter\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\n1997 Chairman's Letter\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOur gain in net worth during 1997\nwas $8.0 billion, which increased the per-share book value of both our\nClass A and Class B stock by 34.1%. Over the last 33 years (that is, since\npresent management took over) per-share book value has grown from $19 to\n$25,488, a rate of 24.1% compounded annually.(1)\n1.\nAll figures used in this report apply to Berkshire's A shares,\nthe successor to the only stock that the company had outstanding\nbefore 1996.\nThe B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30th\nthat of the A.\nGiven our gain of 34.1%, it is\ntempting to declare victory and move on. But last year's performance was\nno great triumph: Any investor can chalk up large returns when stocks\nsoar, as they did in 1997. In a bull market, one must avoid the error of\nthe preening duck that quacks boastfully after a torrential rainstorm,\nthinking that its paddling skills have caused it to rise in the world.\nA right-thinking duck would instead compare its position after the downpour\nto that of the other ducks on the pond.\nSo what's our duck rating for 1997?\nThe table on the facing page shows that though we paddled furiously last\nyear, passive ducks that simply invested in the S&P Index rose almost\nas fast as we did. Our appraisal of 1997's performance, then: Quack.\nWhen the market booms, we tend\nto suffer in comparison with the S&P Index. The Index bears no tax\ncosts, nor do mutual funds, since they pass through all tax liabilities\nto their owners. Last year, on the other hand, Berkshire paid or accrued\n$4.2 billion for federal income tax, or about 18% of our beginning net\nworth.\nBerkshire will always have corporate\ntaxes to pay, which means it needs to overcome their drag in order to justify\nits existence. Obviously, Charlie Munger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman and\nmy partner, and I won't be able to lick that handicap every year. But we\nexpect over time to maintain a modest advantage over the Index, and that\nis the yardstick against which you should measure us. We will not ask you\nto adopt the philosophy of the Chicago Cubs fan who reacted to a string\nof lackluster seasons by saying, \"Why get upset? Everyone has a bad\ncentury now and then.\"\nGains in book value are, of course,\nnot the bottom line at Berkshire. What truly counts are gains in per-share\nintrinsic business value. Ordinarily, though, the two measures tend to\nmove roughly in tandem, and in 1997 that was the case: Led by a blow-out\nperformance at GEICO, Berkshire's intrinsic value (which far exceeds book\nvalue) grew at nearly the same pace as book value.\nFor more explanation of the term,\nintrinsic value, you may wish to refer to our Owner's Manual, reprinted\non pages 62 to 71. This manual sets forth our owner-related business principles,\ninformation that is important to all of Berkshire's shareholders.\nIn our last two annual reports,\nwe furnished you a table that Charlie and I believe is central to estimating\nBerkshire's intrinsic value. In the updated version of that table, which\nfollows, we trace our two key components of value. The first column lists\nour per-share ownership of investments (including cash and equivalents)\nand the second column shows our per-share earnings from Berkshire's operating\nbusinesses before taxes and purchase-accounting adjustments (discussed\non pages 69 and 70), but after all interest and corporate expenses. The\nsecond column excludes all dividends, interest and capital gains that we\nrealized from the investments presented in the first column. In effect,\nthe columns show what Berkshire would look like were it split into two\nparts, with one entity holding our investments and the other operating\nall of our businesses and bearing all corporate costs.\nPre-tax Earnings Per Share\nInvestments\nExcluding All Income from\nYear\nPer Share\nInvestments\n1967\n$\n41\n$\n1.09\n1977\n372\n12.44\n1987\n3,910\n108.14\n1997\n38,043\n717.82\nPundits who ignore what our 38,000\nemployees contribute to the company, and instead simply view Berkshire\nas a de facto investment company, should study the figures in the second\ncolumn. We made our first business acquisition in 1967, and since then\nour pre-tax operating earnings have grown from $1 million to $888 million.\nFurthermore, as noted, in this exercise we have assigned all of Berkshire's\ncorporate expenses -- overhead of $6.6 million, interest of $66.9 million\nand shareholder contributions of $15.4 million -- to our business operations,\neven though a portion of these could just as well have been assigned to\nthe investment side.\nHere are the growth rates of the\ntwo segments by decade:\nPre-tax Earnings Per Share\nInvestments\nExcluding All Income from\nDecade Ending\nPer Share\nInvestments\n1977\n24.6%\n27.6%\n1987\n26.5%\n24.1%\n1997\n25.5%\n20.8%\nAnnual Growth\nRate, 1967-1997\n25.6%\n24.2%\nDuring 1997, both parts of our\nbusiness grew at a satisfactory rate, with investments increasing by $9,543\nper share, or 33.5%, and operating earnings growing by $296.43 per share,\nor 70.3%. One important caveat: Because we were lucky in our super-cat\ninsurance business (to be discussed later) and because GEICO's underwriting\ngain was well above what we can expect in most years, our 1997 operating\nearnings were much better than we anticipated and also more than we expect\nfor 1998.\nOur rate of progress in both investments\nand operations is certain to fall in the future. For anyone deploying\ncapital, nothing recedes like success. My own history makes the point:\nBack in 1951, when I was attending Ben Graham's class at Columbia, an idea\ngiving me a $10,000 gain improved my investment performance for the year\nby a full 100 percentage points. Today, an idea producing a $500 million\npre-tax profit for Berkshire adds one percentage point to our performance.\nIt's no wonder that my annual results in the 1950s were better by nearly\nthirty percentage points than my annual gains in any subsequent decade.\nCharlie's experience was similar. We weren't smarter then, just smaller.\nAt our present size, any performance superiority we achieve will be minor.\nWe will be helped, however, by\nthe fact that the businesses to which we have already allocated capital\n-- both operating subsidiaries and companies in which we are passive investors\n-- have splendid long-term prospects. We are also blessed with a managerial\ncorps that is unsurpassed in ability and focus. Most of these executives\nare wealthy and do not need the pay they receive from Berkshire to maintain\ntheir way of life. They are motivated by the joy of accomplishment, not\nby fame or fortune.\nThough we are delighted with what\nwe own, we are not pleased with our prospects for committing incoming funds.\nPrices are high for both businesses and stocks. That does not mean that\nthe prices of either will fall -- we have absolutely no view on that matter\n-- but it does mean that we get relatively little in prospective earnings\nwhen we commit fresh money.\nUnder these circumstances, we try\nto exert a Ted Williams kind of discipline. In his book The Science\nof Hitting, Ted explains that he carved the strike zone into 77 cells,\neach the size of a baseball. Swinging only at balls in his \"best\"\ncell, he knew, would allow him to bat .400; reaching for balls in his \"worst\"\nspot, the low outside corner of the strike zone, would reduce him to .230.\nIn other words, waiting for the fat pitch would mean a trip to the Hall\nof Fame; swinging indiscriminately would mean a ticket to the minors.\nIf they are in the strike zone\nat all, the business \"pitches\" we now see are just catching the\nlower outside corner. If we swing, we will be locked into low returns.\nBut if we let all of today's balls go by, there can be no assurance that\nthe next ones we see will be more to our liking. Perhaps the attractive\nprices of the past were the aberrations, not the full prices of today.\nUnlike Ted, we can't be called out if we resist three pitches that are\nbarely in the strike zone; nevertheless, just standing there, day after\nday, with my bat on my shoulder is not my idea of fun.\nUnconventional Commitments\nWhen we can't find our favorite\ncommitment -- a well-run and sensibly-priced business with fine economics\n-- we usually opt to put new money into very short-term instruments of\nthe highest quality. Sometimes, however, we venture elsewhere. Obviously\nwe believe that the alternative commitments we make are more likely to\nresult in profit than loss. But we also realize that they do not offer\nthe certainty of profit that exists in a wonderful business secured at\nan attractive price. Finding that kind of opportunity, we know that\nwe are going to make money -- the only question being when. With alternative\ninvestments, we think that we are going to make money. But we also\nrecognize that we will sometimes realize losses, occasionally of substantial\nsize.\nWe had three non-traditional positions\nat yearend. The first was derivative contracts for 14.0 million barrels\nof oil, that being what was then left of a 45.7 million barrel position\nwe established in 1994-95. Contracts for 31.7 million barrels were settled\nin 1995-97, and these supplied us with a pre-tax gain of about $61.9 million.\nOur remaining contracts expire during 1998 and 1999. In these, we had an\nunrealized gain of $11.6 million at yearend. Accounting rules require that\ncommodity positions be carried at market value. Therefore, both our annual\nand quarterly financial statements reflect any unrealized gain or loss\nin these contracts. When we established our contracts, oil for future delivery\nseemed modestly underpriced. Today, though, we have no opinion as to its\nattractiveness.\nOur second non-traditional commitment\nis in silver. Last year, we purchased 111.2 million ounces. Marked to market,\nthat position produced a pre-tax gain of $97.4 million for us in 1997.\nIn a way, this is a return to the past for me: Thirty years ago, I bought\nsilver because I anticipated its demonetization by the U.S. Government.\nEver since, I have followed the metal's fundamentals but not owned it.\nIn recent years, bullion inventories have fallen materially, and last summer\nCharlie and I concluded that a higher price would be needed to establish\nequilibrium between supply and demand. Inflation expectations, it should\nbe noted, play no part in our calculation of silver's value.\nFinally, our largest non-traditional\nposition at yearend was $4.6 billion, at amortized cost, of long-term zero-coupon\nobligations of the U.S. Treasury. These securities pay no interest. Instead,\nthey provide their holders a return by way of the discount at which they\nare purchased, a characteristic that makes their market prices move rapidly\nwhen interest rates change. If rates rise, you lose heavily with zeros,\nand if rates fall, you make outsized gains. Since rates fell in 1997, we\nended the year with an unrealized pre-tax gain of $598.8 million in our\nzeros. Because we carry the securities at market value, that gain is reflected\nin yearend book value.\nIn purchasing zeros, rather than\nstaying with cash-equivalents, we risk looking very foolish: A macro-based\ncommitment such as this never has anything close to a 100% probability\nof being successful. However, you pay Charlie and me to use our best judgment\n-- not to avoid embarrassment -- and we will occasionally make an unconventional\nmove when we believe the odds favor it. Try to think kindly of us when\nwe blow one. Along with President Clinton, we will be feeling your pain:\nThe Munger family has more than 90% of its net worth in Berkshire and the\nBuffetts more than 99%.\nHow We Think About Market Fluctuations\nA short quiz: If you plan to eat\nhamburgers throughout your life and are not a cattle producer, should you\nwish for higher or lower prices for beef? Likewise, if you are going to\nbuy a car from time to time but are not an auto manufacturer, should you\nprefer higher or lower car prices? These questions, of course, answer themselves.\nBut now for the final exam: If\nyou expect to be a net saver during the next five years, should you hope\nfor a higher or lower stock market during that period? Many investors get\nthis one wrong. Even though they are going to be net buyers of stocks for\nmany years to come, they are elated when stock prices rise and depressed\nwhen they fall. In effect, they rejoice because prices have risen for the\n\"hamburgers\" they will soon be buying. This reaction makes no\nsense. Only those who will be sellers of equities in the near future should\nbe happy at seeing stocks rise. Prospective purchasers should much prefer\nsinking prices.\nFor shareholders of Berkshire who\ndo not expect to sell, the choice is even clearer. To begin with, our owners\nare automatically saving even if they spend every dime they personally\nearn: Berkshire \"saves\" for them by retaining all earnings, thereafter\nusing these savings to purchase businesses and securities. Clearly, the\nmore cheaply we make these buys, the more profitable our owners' indirect\nsavings program will be.\nFurthermore, through Berkshire\nyou own major positions in companies that consistently repurchase their\nshares. The benefits that these programs supply us grow as prices fall:\nWhen stock prices are low, the funds that an investee spends on repurchases\nincrease our ownership of that company by a greater amount than is the\ncase when prices are higher. For example, the repurchases that Coca-Cola,\nThe Washington Post and Wells Fargo made in past years at very low prices\nbenefitted Berkshire far more than do today's repurchases, made at loftier\nprices.\nAt the end of every year, about\n97% of Berkshire's shares are held by the same investors who owned them\nat the start of the year. That makes them savers. They should therefore\nrejoice when markets decline and allow both us and our investees to deploy\nfunds more advantageously.\nSo smile when you read a headline\nthat says \"Investors lose as market falls.\" Edit it in your mind\nto \"Disinvestors lose as market falls -- but investors gain.\"\nThough writers often forget this truism, there is a buyer for every seller\nand what hurts one necessarily helps the other. (As they say in golf matches:\n\"Every putt makes someone happy.\")\nWe gained enormously from the low\nprices placed on many equities and businesses in the 1970s and 1980s. Markets\nthat then were hostile to investment transients were friendly to those\ntaking up permanent residence. In recent years, the actions we took in\nthose decades have been validated, but we have found few new opportunities.\nIn its role as a corporate \"saver,\" Berkshire continually looks\nfor ways to sensibly deploy capital, but it may be some time before we\nfind opportunities that get us truly excited.\nInsurance Operations -- Overview\nWhat does excite us, however, is\nour insurance business. GEICO is flying, and we expect that it will continue\nto do so. Before we expound on that, though, let's discuss \"float\"\nand how to measure its cost. Unless you understand this subject, it will\nbe impossible for you to make an informed judgment about Berkshire's intrinsic\nvalue.\nTo begin with, float is money we\nhold but don't own. In an insurance operation, float arises because premiums\nare received before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends\nover many years. During that time, the insurer invests the money. Typically,\nthis pleasant activity carries with it a downside: The premiums that an\ninsurer takes in usually do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually\nmust pay. That leaves it running an \"underwriting loss,\" which\nis the cost of float. An insurance business has value if its cost of float\nover time is less than the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain\nfunds. But the business is a lemon if its cost of float is higher than\nmarket rates for money.\nA caution is appropriate here:\nBecause loss costs must be estimated, insurers have enormous latitude in\nfiguring their underwriting results, and that makes it very difficult for\ninvestors to calculate a company's true cost of float. Estimating errors,\nusually innocent but sometimes not, can be huge. The consequences of these\nmiscalculations flow directly into earnings. An experienced observer can\nusually detect large-scale errors in reserving, but the general public\ncan typically do no more than accept what's presented, and at times I have\nbeen amazed by the numbers that big-name auditors have implicitly blessed.\nAs for Berkshire, Charlie and I attempt to be conservative in presenting\nits underwriting results to you, because we have found that virtually all\nsurprises in insurance are unpleasant ones.\nAs the numbers in the following\ntable show, Berkshire's insurance business has been a huge winner. For\nthe table, we have calculated our float -- which we generate in large amounts\nrelative to our premium volume -- by adding net loss reserves, loss adjustment\nreserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned premium reserves,\nand then subtracting agents' balances, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid\ntaxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance. Our cost\nof float is determined by our underwriting loss or profit. In those years\nwhen we have had an underwriting profit, such as the last five, our cost\nof float has been negative. In effect, we have been paid for holding money.\n(1)\n(2)\nYearend Yield\nUnderwriting\nApproximate\non Long-Term\nLoss\nAverage Float\nCost of Funds\nGovt.

Better yet, it has cost us nothing, and in fact has made us money.\nTherein lies an accounting irony: Though our float is shown on our balance\nsheet as a liability, it has had a value to Berkshire greater than an equal\namount of net worth would have had.\nThe expiration of several large\ncontracts will cause our float to decline during the first quarter of 1998,\nbut we expect it to grow substantially over the long term. We also believe\nthat our cost of float will continue to be highly favorable.\nSuper-Cat Insurance\nOccasionally, however, the cost\nof our float will spike severely. That will occur because of our heavy\ninvolvement in the super-cat business, which by its nature is the most\nvolatile of all insurance lines. In this operation, we sell policies that\ninsurance and reinsurance companies purchase in order to limit their losses\nwhen mega-catastrophes strike. Berkshire is the preferred market for sophisticated\nbuyers: When the \"big one\" hits, the financial strength of super-cat\nwriters will be tested, and Berkshire has no peer in this respect.\nSince truly major catastrophes\nare rare occurrences, our super-cat business can be expected to show large\nprofits in most years -- and to record a huge loss occasionally. In other\nwords, the attractiveness of our super-cat business will take a great many\nyears to measure. What you must understand, however, is that a truly\nterrible year in the super-cat business is not a possibility -- it's a\ncertainty. The only question is when it will come.\nLast year, we were very lucky in\nour super-cat operation. The world suffered no catastrophes that caused\nhuge amounts of insured damage, so virtually all premiums that we received\ndropped to the bottom line. This pleasant result has a dark side, however.\nMany investors who are \"innocents\" -- meaning that they rely\non representations of salespeople rather than on underwriting knowledge\nof their own -- have come into the reinsurance business by means of purchasing\npieces of paper that are called \"catastrophe bonds.\" The second\nword in this term, though, is an Orwellian misnomer: A true bond obliges\nthe issuer to pay; these bonds, in effect, are contracts that lay a provisional\npromise to pay on the purchaser.\nThis convoluted arrangement came\ninto being because the promoters of the contracts wished to circumvent\nlaws that prohibit the writing of insurance by entities that haven't been\nlicensed by the state. A side benefit for the promoters is that calling\nthe insurance contract a \"bond\" may also cause unsophisticated\nbuyers to assume that these instruments involve far less risk than is actually\nthe case.\nTruly outsized risks will exist\nin these contracts if they are not properly priced. A pernicious aspect\nof catastrophe insurance, however, makes it likely that mispricing, even\nof a severe variety, will not be discovered for a very long time. Consider,\nfor example, the odds of throwing a 12 with a pair of dice -- 1 out of\n36. Now assume that the dice will be thrown once a year; that you, the\n\"bond-buyer,\" agree to pay $50 million if a 12 appears; and that\nfor \"insuring\" this risk you take in an annual \"premium\"\nof $1 million. That would mean you had significantly underpriced the risk.\nNevertheless, you could go along for years thinking you were making money\n-- indeed, easy money. There is actually a 75.4% probability that you would\ngo for a decade without paying out a dime. Eventually, however, you would\ngo broke.\nIn this dice example, the odds\nare easy to figure. Calculations involving monster hurricanes and earthquakes\nare necessarily much fuzzier, and the best we can do at Berkshire is to\nestimate a range of probabilities for such events. The lack of precise\ndata, coupled with the rarity of such catastrophes, plays into the hands\nof promoters, who typically employ an \"expert\" to advise the\npotential bond-buyer about the probability of losses. The expert puts no\nmoney on the table. Instead, he receives an up-front payment that is forever\nhis no matter how inaccurate his predictions. Surprise: When the stakes\nare high, an expert can invariably be found who will affirm -- to return\nto our example -- that the chance of rolling a 12 is not 1 in 36, but more\nlike 1 in 100. (In fairness, we should add that the expert will probably\nbelieve that his odds are correct, a fact that makes him less reprehensible\n-- but more dangerous.)\nThe influx of \"investor\"\nmoney into catastrophe bonds -- which may well live up to their name --\nhas caused super-cat prices to deteriorate materially. Therefore, we will\nwrite less business in 1998. We have some large multi-year contracts in\nforce, however, that will mitigate the drop. The largest of these are two\npolicies that we described in last year's report -- one covering hurricanes\nin Florida and the other, signed with the California Earthquake Authority,\ncovering earthquakes in that state. Our \"worst-case\" loss remains\nabout $600 million after-tax, the maximum we could lose under the CEA policy.\nThough this loss potential may sound large, it is only about 1% of Berkshire's\nmarket value. Indeed, if we could get appropriate prices, we would be willing\nto significantly increase our \"worst-case\" exposure.\nOur super-cat business was developed\nfrom scratch by Ajit Jain, who has contributed to Berkshire's success in\na variety of other ways as well. Ajit possesses both the discipline to\nwalk away from business that is inadequately priced and the imagination\nto then find other opportunities. Quite simply, he is one of Berkshire's\nmajor assets. Ajit would have been a star in whatever career he chose;\nfortunately for us, he enjoys insurance.\nInsurance -- GEICO (1-800-555-2756) and Other Primary Operations\nLast year I wrote about GEICO's\nTony Nicely and his terrific management skills. If I had known then what\nhe had in store for us in 1997, I would have searched for still greater\nsuperlatives. Tony, now 54, has been with GEICO for 36 years and last year\nwas his best. As CEO, he has transmitted vision, energy and enthusiasm\nto all members of the GEICO family -- raising their sights from what has\nbeen achieved to what can be achieved.\nWe measure GEICO's performance\nby first, the net increase in its voluntary auto policies (that is, not\nincluding policies assigned us by the state) and, second, the profitability\nof \"seasoned\" auto business, meaning policies that have been\nwith us for more than a year and are thus past the period in which acquisition\ncosts cause them to be money-losers. In 1996, in-force business grew 10%,\nand I told you how pleased I was, since that rate was well above anything\nwe had seen in two decades. Then, in 1997, growth jumped to 16%.\nBelow are the new business and\nin-force figures for the last five years:\nNew Voluntary\nVoluntary Auto\nYears\nAuto Policies\nPolicies in Force\n1993\n354,882\n2,011,055\n1994\n396,217\n2,147,549\n1995\n461,608\n2,310,037\n1996\n617,669\n2,543,699\n1997\n913,176\n2,949,439\nOf course, any insurer can grow\nrapidly if it gets careless about underwriting. GEICO's underwriting profit\nfor the year, though, was 8.1% of premiums, far above its average. Indeed,\nthat percentage was higher than we wish it to be: Our goal is to pass on\nmost of the benefits of our low-cost operation to our customers, holding\nourselves to about 4% in underwriting profit. With that in mind, we reduced\nour average rates a bit during 1997 and may well cut them again this year.\nOur rate changes varied, of course, depending on the policyholder and where\nhe lives; we strive to charge a rate that properly reflects the loss expectancy\nof each driver.\nGEICO is not the only auto insurer\nobtaining favorable results these days. Last year, the industry recorded\nprofits that were far better than it anticipated or can sustain. Intensified\ncompetition will soon squeeze margins very significantly. But this is a\ndevelopment we welcome: Long term, a tough market helps the low-cost operator,\nwhich is what we are and intend to remain.\nLast year I told you about the\nrecord 16.9% profit-sharing contribution that GEICO's associates had earned\nand explained that two simple variables set the amount: policy growth and\nprofitability of seasoned business. I further explained that 1996's performance\nwas so extraordinary that we had to enlarge the chart delineating the possible\npayouts. The new configuration didn't make it through 1997: We enlarged\nthe chart's boundaries again and awarded our 10,500 associates a profit-sharing\ncontribution amounting to 26.9% of their base compensation, or $71 million.\nIn addition, the same two variables -- policy growth and profitability\nof seasoned business -- determined the cash bonuses that we paid to dozens\nof top executives, starting with Tony.\nAt GEICO, we are paying in a way\nthat makes sense for both our owners and our managers. We distribute merit\nbadges, not lottery tickets: In none of Berkshire's subsidiaries do we\nrelate compensation to our stock price, which our associates cannot affect\nin any meaningful way. Instead, we tie bonuses to each unit's business\nperformance, which is the direct product of the unit's people. When that\nperformance is terrific -- as it has been at GEICO -- there is nothing\nCharlie and I enjoy more than writing a big check.\nGEICO's underwriting profitability\nwill probably fall in 1998, but the company's growth could accelerate.\nWe're planning to step on the gas: GEICO's marketing expenditures this\nyear will top $100 million, up 50% from 1997. Our market share today is\nonly 3%, a level of penetration that should increase dramatically in the\nnext decade. The auto insurance industry is huge -- it does about $115\nbillion of volume annually -- and there are tens of millions of drivers\nwho would save substantial money by switching to us.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIn the 1995 report, I described\nthe enormous debt that you and I owe to Lorimer Davidson. On a Saturday\nearly in 1951, he patiently explained the ins and outs of both GEICO and\nits industry to me -- a 20-year-old stranger who'd arrived at GEICO's headquarters\nuninvited and unannounced. Davy later became the company's CEO and has\nremained my friend and teacher for 47 years. The huge rewards that GEICO\nhas heaped on Berkshire would not have materialized had it not been for\nhis generosity and wisdom. Indeed, had I not met Davy, I might never have\ngrown to understand the whole field of insurance, which over the years\nhas played such a key part in Berkshire's success.\nDavy turned 95 last year, and it's\ndifficult for him to travel. Nevertheless, Tony and I hope that we can\npersuade him to attend our annual meeting, so that our shareholders can\nproperly thank him for his important contributions to Berkshire. Wish us\nluck.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThough they are, of course, far\nsmaller than GEICO, our other primary insurance operations turned in results\nlast year that, in aggregate, were fully as stunning. National Indemnity's\ntraditional business had an underwriting profit of 32.9% and, as usual,\ndeveloped a large amount of float compared to premium volume. Over the\nlast three years, this segment of our business, run by Don Wurster, has\nhad a profit of 24.3%. Our homestate operation, managed by Rod Eldred,\nrecorded an underwriting profit of 14.1% even though it continued to absorb\nthe expenses of geographical expansion. Rod's three-year record is an amazing\n15.1%. Berkshire's workers' compensation business, run out of California\nby Brad Kinstler, had a modest underwriting loss in a difficult environment;\nits three-year underwriting record is a positive 1.5%. John Kizer, at Central\nStates Indemnity, set a new volume record while generating good underwriting\nearnings. At Kansas Bankers Surety, Don Towle more than lived up to the\nhigh expectations we had when we purchased the company in 1996.\nIn aggregate, these five operations\nrecorded an underwriting profit of 15.0%. The two Dons, along with Rod,\nBrad and John, have created significant value for Berkshire, and we believe\nthere is more to come.\nSources of Reported Earnings\nThe table that follows shows the\nmain sources of Berkshire's reported earnings. In this presentation, purchase-accounting\nadjustments are not assigned to the specific businesses to which they apply,\nbut are instead aggregated and shown separately. This procedure lets you\nview the earnings of our businesses as they would have been reported had\nwe not purchased them. For the reasons discussed on pages 69 and 70, this\nform of presentation seems to us to be more useful to investors and managers\nthan one utilizing generally-accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which\nrequire purchase-premiums to be charged off business-by-business. The total\nearnings we show in the table are, of course, identical to the GAAP total\nin our audited financial statements.\n(in millions)\nBerkshire's Share\nof Net Earnings\n(after taxes and\nPre-Tax Earnings\nminority interests)\n1997\n1996\n1997\n1996\nOperating Earnings:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting -- Super-Cat. . . . . . . .$\n283.0\n$\n167.0\n$\n182.7\n$\n107.4\nUnderwriting -- Other Reinsurance. . . .\n(155.2)\n(174.8)\n(100.1)\n(112.4)\nUnderwriting -- GEICO. . . . . . . . . .\n280.7\n171.4\n181.1\n110.2\nUnderwriting -- Other Primary. . . . . .\n52.9\n58.5\n34.1\n37.6\nNet Investment Income. . . . . . . . . .\n882.3\n726.2\n703.6\n593.1\nBuffalo News . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n55.9\n50.4\n32.7\n29.5\nFinance Businesses . . . . . . . . . . . .\n28.1\n23.1\n18.0\n14.9\nFlightSafety . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n139.5\n3.1(1)\n84.4\n1.9(1)\nHome Furnishings . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n56.8(2)\n43.8\n32.2(2)\n24.8\nJewelry. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n31.6\n27.8\n18.3\n16.1\nScott Fetzer(excluding finance operation).\n118.9\n121.7\n77.3\n81.6\nSee's Candies. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n58.6\n51.9\n35.0\n30.8\nShoe Group . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n48.8\n61.6\n32.2\n41.0\nPurchase-Accounting Adjustments. . . . . .\n(104.9)\n(75.7)\n(97.0)\n(70.5)\nInterest Expense(3). . . . . . . . . . . .\n(106.6)\n(94.3)\n(67.1)\n(56.6)\nShareholder-Designated Contributions . . .\n(15.4)\n(13.3)\n(9.9)\n(8.5)\nOther. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n60.7\n73.0\n37.0\n42.2\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nOperating Earnings . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,715.7\n1,221.4\n1,194.5\n883.1\nCapital Gains from Investments . . . . . . . 1,111.9\n2,484.5\n707.1\n1,605.5\n--------\n--------\n--------\n--------\nTotal Earnings - All Entities. . . . . . . .$2,827.6\n$3,705.9\n$1,901.6\n$2,488.6\n========\n========\n========\n========\n(1) From date of acquisition,\nDecember 23, 1996.\n(2) Includes Star\nFurniture from July 1, 1997.\n(3) Excludes interest\nexpense of Finance Businesses.\nOverall, our operating businesses\ncontinue to perform exceptionally well, far outdoing their industry norms.\nWe are particularly pleased that profits improved at Helzberg's after a\ndisappointing 1996. Jeff Comment, Helzberg's CEO, took decisive steps early\nin 1997 that enabled the company to gain real momentum by the crucial Christmas\nseason. In the early part of this year, as well, sales remained strong.\nCasual observers may not appreciate\njust how extraordinary the performance of many of our businesses has been:\nIf the earnings history of, say, Buffalo News or Scott Fetzer is compared\nto the records of their publicly-owned peers, their performance might seem\nto have been unexceptional. But most public companies retain two-thirds\nor more of their earnings to fund their corporate growth. In contrast,\nthose Berkshire subsidiaries have paid 100% of their earnings to us, their\nparent company, to fund our growth.\nIn effect, the records of the public\ncompanies reflect the cumulative benefits of the earnings they have retained,\nwhile the records of our operating subsidiaries get no such boost. Over\ntime, however, the earnings these subsidiaries have distributed have created\ntruly huge amounts of earning power elsewhere in Berkshire. The News, See's\nand Scott Fetzer have alone paid us $1.8 billion, which we have gainfully\nemployed elsewhere. We owe their managements our gratitude for much more\nthan the earnings that are detailed in the table.\nAdditional information about our\nvarious businesses is given on pages 36 - 50, where you will also find\nour segment earnings reported on a GAAP basis. In addition, on pages 55\n- 61, we have rearranged Berkshire's financial data into four segments\non a non-GAAP basis, a presentation that corresponds to the way Charlie\nand I think about the company. Our intent is to supply you with the financial\ninformation that we would wish you to give us if our positions were reversed.\nLook-Through Earnings\nReported earnings are a poor measure\nof economic progress at Berkshire, in part because the numbers shown in\nthe table presented earlier include only the dividends we receive from\ninvestees -- though these dividends typically represent only a small fraction\nof the earnings attributable to our ownership. Not that we mind this division\nof money, since on balance we regard the undistributed earnings of investees\nas more valuable to us than the portion paid out. The reason is simple:\nOur investees often have the opportunity to reinvest earnings at high rates\nof return. So why should we want them paid out?\nTo depict something closer to economic\nreality at Berkshire than reported earnings, though, we employ the concept\nof \"look-through\" earnings. As we calculate these, they consist\nof: (1) the operating earnings reported in the previous section, plus;\n(2) our share of the retained operating earnings of major investees that,\nunder GAAP accounting, are not reflected in our profits, less; (3) an allowance\nfor the tax that would be paid by Berkshire if these retained earnings\nof investees had instead been distributed to us. When tabulating \"operating\nearnings\" here, we exclude purchase-accounting adjustments as well\nas capital gains and other major non-recurring items.\nThe following table sets forth\nour 1997 look-through earnings, though I warn you that the figures can\nbe no more than approximate, since they are based on a number of judgment\ncalls. (The dividends paid to us by these investees have been included\nin the operating earnings itemized on page 11, mostly under \"Insurance\nGroup: Net Investment Income.\")\nBerkshire's Share\nof Undistributed\nBerkshire's Approximate\nOperating Earnings\nBerkshire's Major Investees\nOwnership at Yearend(1)\n(in millions)(2)\nAmerican Express Company\n10.7%\n$161\nThe Coca-Cola Company\n8.1%\n216\nThe Walt Disney Company\n3.2%\n65\nFreddie Mac\n8.6%\n86\nThe Gillette Company\n8.6%\n82\nThe Washington Post Company\n16.5%\n30\nWells Fargo & Company\n7.8%\n103\n------\nBerkshire's share of undistributed earnings of major investees\n743\nHypothetical tax on these undistributed investee earnings(3)\n(105)\nReported operating earnings of Berkshire\n1,292\n------\nTotal look-through earnings of Berkshire\n$1,930\n======\n(1) Does not include shares allocable to minority interests\n(2) Calculated on average ownership for the year\n(3) The tax rate used is 14%, which is the rate Berkshire\npays on the dividends it receives\nAcquisitions of 1997\nIn 1997, we agreed to acquire Star\nFurniture and International Dairy Queen (a deal that closed early in 1998).\nBoth businesses fully meet our criteria: They are understandable; possess\nexcellent economics; and are run by outstanding people.\nThe Star transaction has an interesting\nhistory. Whenever we buy into an industry whose leading participants aren't\nknown to me, I always ask our new partners, \"Are there any more at\nhome like you?\" Upon our purchase of Nebraska Furniture Mart in 1983,\ntherefore, the Blumkin family told me about three outstanding furniture\nretailers in other parts of the country. At the time, however, none was\nfor sale.\nMany years later, Irv Blumkin learned\nthat Bill Child, CEO of R.C. Willey -- one of the recommended three --\nmight be interested in merging, and we promptly made the deal described\nin the 1995 report. We have been delighted with that association -- Bill\nis the perfect partner. Furthermore, when we asked Bill about industry\nstandouts, he came up with the remaining two names given me by the Blumkins,\none of these being Star Furniture of Houston. But time went by without\nthere being any indication that either of the two was available.\nOn the Thursday before last year's\nannual meeting, however, Bob Denham of Salomon told me that Melvyn Wolff,\nthe long-time controlling shareholder and CEO of Star, wanted to talk.\nAt our invitation, Melvyn came to the meeting and spent his time in Omaha\nconfirming his positive feelings about Berkshire. I, meanwhile, looked\nat Star's financials, and liked what I saw.\nA few days later, Melvyn and I\nmet in New York and made a deal in a single, two-hour session. As was the\ncase with the Blumkins and Bill Child, I had no need to check leases, work\nout employment contracts, etc. I knew I was dealing with a man of integrity\nand that's what counted.\nThough the Wolff family's association\nwith Star dates back to 1924, the business struggled until Melvyn and his\nsister Shirley Toomin took over in 1962. Today Star operates 12 stores\n-- ten in Houston and one each in Austin and Bryan -- and will soon move\ninto San Antonio as well. We won't be surprised if Star is many times its\npresent size a decade from now.\nHere's a story illustrating what\nMelvyn and Shirley are like: When they told their associates of the sale,\nthey also announced that Star would make large, special payments to those\nwho had helped them succeed -- and then defined that group as everyone\nin the business. Under the terms of our deal, it was Melvyn and Shirley's\nmoney, not ours, that funded this distribution. Charlie and I love it when\nwe become partners with people who behave like that.\nThe Star transaction closed on\nJuly 1. In the months since, we've watched Star's already-excellent sales\nand earnings growth accelerate further. Melvyn and Shirley will be at the\nannual meeting, and I hope you get a chance to meet them.\nNext acquisition: International\nDairy Queen. There are 5,792 Dairy Queen stores operating in 23 countries\n-- all but a handful run by franchisees -- and in addition IDQ franchises\n409 Orange Julius operations and 43 Karmelkorn operations. In 190 locations,\n\"treat centers\" provide some combination of the three products.\nFor many years IDQ had a bumpy\nhistory. Then, in 1970, a Minneapolis group led by John Mooty and Rudy\nLuther took control. The new managers inherited a jumble of different franchising\nagreements, along with some unwise financing arrangements that had left\nthe company in a precarious condition. In the years that followed, management\nrationalized the operation, extended food service to many more locations,\nand, in general, built a strong organization.\nLast summer Mr. Luther died, which\nmeant his estate needed to sell stock. A year earlier, Dick Kiphart of\nWilliam Blair & Co., had introduced me to John Mooty and Mike Sullivan,\nIDQ's CEO, and I had been impressed with both men. So, when we got the\nchance to merge with IDQ, we offered a proposition patterned on our FlightSafety\nacquisition, extending selling shareholders the option of choosing either\ncash or Berkshire shares having a slightly lower immediate value. By tilting\nthe consideration as we did, we encouraged holders to opt for cash, the\ntype of payment we by far prefer. Even then, only 45% of IDQ shares elected\ncash.\nCharlie and I bring a modicum of\nproduct expertise to this transaction: He has been patronizing the Dairy\nQueens in Cass Lake and Bemidji, Minnesota, for decades, and I have been\na regular in Omaha. We have put our money where our mouth is.\nA Confession\nI've mentioned that we strongly\nprefer to use cash rather than Berkshire stock in acquisitions. A study\nof the record will tell you why: If you aggregate all of our stock-only\nmergers (excluding those we did with two affiliated companies, Diversified\nRetailing and Blue Chip Stamps), you will find that our shareholders are\nslightly worse off than they would have been had I not done the transactions.\nThough it hurts me to say it, when I've issued stock, I've cost you money.\nBe clear about one thing: This\ncost has not occurred because we were misled in any way by sellers\nor because they thereafter failed to manage with diligence and skill. On\nthe contrary, the sellers were completely candid when we were negotiating\nour deals and have been energetic and effective ever since.\nInstead, our problem has been that\nwe own a truly marvelous collection of businesses, which means that trading\naway a portion of them for something new almost never makes sense. When\nwe issue shares in a merger, we reduce your ownership in all of our businesses\n-- partly-owned companies such as Coca-Cola, Gillette and American Express,\nand all of our terrific operating companies as well. An example from sports\nwill illustrate the difficulty we face: For a baseball team, acquiring\na player who can be expected to bat .350 is almost always a wonderful event\n-- except when the team must trade a .380 hitter to make the deal.\nBecause our roster is filled with\n.380 hitters, we have tried to pay cash for acquisitions, and here our\nrecord has been far better. Starting with National Indemnity in 1967, and\ncontinuing with, among others, See's, Buffalo News, Scott Fetzer and GEICO,\nwe have acquired -- for cash -- a number of large businesses that have\nperformed incredibly well since we bought them. These acquisitions have\ndelivered Berkshire tremendous value -- indeed, far more than I anticipated\nwhen we made our purchases.\nWe believe that it is almost impossible\nfor us to \"trade up\" from our present businesses and managements.\nOur situation is the opposite of Camelot's Mordred, of whom Guenevere commented,\n\"The one thing I can say for him is that he is bound to marry well.\nEverybody is above him.\" Marrying well is extremely difficult for\nBerkshire.\nSo you can be sure that Charlie\nand I will be very reluctant to issue shares in the future. In those cases\nwhen we simply must do so -- when certain shareholders of a desirable acquiree\ninsist on getting stock -- we will include an attractive cash option in\norder to tempt as many of the sellers to take cash as is possible.\nMerging with public companies presents\na special problem for us. If we are to offer any premium to the\nacquiree, one of two conditions must be present: Either our own stock must\nbe overvalued relative to the acquiree's, or the two companies together\nmust be expected to earn more than they would if operated separately. Historically,\nBerkshire has seldom been overvalued. In this market, moreover, undervalued\nacquirees are almost impossible to find. That other possibility -- synergy\ngains -- is usually unrealistic, since we expect acquirees to operate after\nwe've bought them just as they did before. Joining with Berkshire does\nnot normally raise their revenues nor cut their costs.\nIndeed, their reported costs (but\nnot their true ones) will rise after they are bought by Berkshire\nif the acquiree has been granting options as part of its compensation packages.\nIn these cases, \"earnings\" of the acquiree have been overstated\nbecause they have followed the standard -- but, in our view, dead wrong\n-- accounting practice of ignoring the cost to a business of issuing options.\nWhen Berkshire acquires an option-issuing company, we promptly substitute\na cash compensation plan having an economic value equivalent to that of\nthe previous option plan. The acquiree's true compensation cost is thereby\nbrought out of the closet and charged, as it should be, against earnings.\nThe reasoning that Berkshire applies\nto the merger of public companies should be the calculus for all\nbuyers. Paying a takeover premium does not make sense for any acquirer\nunless a) its stock is overvalued relative to the acquiree's or b) the\ntwo enterprises will earn more combined than they would separately. Predictably,\nacquirers normally hew to the second argument because very few are willing\nto acknowledge that their stock is overvalued. However, voracious buyers\n-- the ones that issue shares as fast as they can print them -- are tacitly\nconceding that point. (Often, also, they are running Wall Street's version\nof a chain-letter scheme.)\nIn some mergers there truly are\nmajor synergies -- though oftentimes the acquirer pays too much to obtain\nthem -- but at other times the cost and revenue benefits that are projected\nprove illusory. Of one thing, however, be certain: If a CEO is enthused\nabout a particularly foolish acquisition, both his internal staff and his\noutside advisors will come up with whatever projections are needed to justify\nhis stance. Only in fairy tales are emperors told that they are naked.\nCommon Stock Investments\nBelow we present our common stock\ninvestments.

In these, we significantly\nreduced a few of our holdings that are below the $750 million threshold\nfor itemization, and we also modestly trimmed a few of the larger positions\nthat we detail. Some of the sales we made during 1997 were aimed at changing\nour bond-stock ratio moderately in response to the relative values that\nwe saw in each market, a realignment we have continued in 1998.\nOur reported positions, we should\nadd, sometimes reflect the investment decisions of GEICO's Lou Simpson.\nLou independently runs an equity portfolio of nearly $2 billion that may\nat times overlap the portfolio that I manage, and occasionally he makes\nmoves that differ from mine.\nThough we don't attempt to predict\nthe movements of the stock market, we do try, in a very rough way, to value\nit. At the annual meeting last year, with the Dow at 7,071 and long-term\nTreasury yields at 6.89%, Charlie and I stated that we did not consider\nthe market overvalued if 1) interest rates remained where they were\nor fell, and 2) American business continued to earn the remarkable returns\non equity that it had recently recorded. So far, interest rates have fallen\n-- that's one requisite satisfied -- and returns on equity still remain\nexceptionally high. If they stay there -- and if interest rates hold near\nrecent levels -- there is no reason to think of stocks as generally overvalued.\nOn the other hand, returns on equity are not a sure thing to remain at,\nor even near, their present levels.\nIn the summer of 1979, when equities\nlooked cheap to me, I wrote a Forbes article entitled \"You\npay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus.\"\nAt that time skepticism and disappointment prevailed, and my point was\nthat investors should be glad of the fact, since pessimism drives down\nprices to truly attractive levels. Now, however, we have a very cheery\nconsensus. That does not necessarily mean this is the wrong time to buy\nstocks: Corporate America is now earning far more money than it was just\na few years ago, and in the presence of lower interest rates, every dollar\nof earnings becomes more valuable. Today's price levels, though, have materially\neroded the \"margin of safety\" that Ben Graham identified as the\ncornerstone of intelligent investing.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIn last year's annual report, I\ndiscussed Coca-Cola, our largest holding. Coke continues to increase its\nmarket dominance throughout the world, but, tragically, it has lost the\nleader responsible for its outstanding performance. Roberto Goizueta, Coke's\nCEO since 1981, died in October. After his death, I read every one of the\nmore than 100 letters and notes he had written me during the past nine\nyears. Those messages could well serve as a guidebook for success in both\nbusiness and life.\nIn these communications, Roberto\ndisplayed a brilliant and clear strategic vision that was always aimed\nat advancing the well-being of Coke shareholders. Roberto knew where he\nwas leading the company, how he was going to get there, and why this path\nmade the most sense for his owners -- and, equally important, he had a\nburning sense of urgency about reaching his goals. An excerpt from one\nhandwritten note he sent to me illustrates his mind-set: \"By the way,\nI have told Olguita that what she refers to as an obsession, you call focus.\nI like your term much better.\" Like all who knew Roberto, I will miss\nhim enormously.\nConsistent with his concern for\nthe company, Roberto prepared for a seamless succession long before it\nseemed necessary. Roberto knew that Doug Ivester was the right man to take\nover and worked with Doug over the years to ensure that no momentum would\nbe lost when the time for change arrived. The Coca-Cola Company will be\nthe same steamroller under Doug as it was under Roberto.\nConvertible Preferreds\nTwo years ago, I gave you an update\non the five convertible preferreds that we purchased through private placements\nin the 1987-1991 period. At the time of that earlier report, we had realized\na small profit on the sale of our Champion International holding. The four\nremaining preferred commitments included two, Gillette and First Empire\nState, that we had converted into common stock in which we had large unrealized\ngains, and two others, USAir and Salomon, that had been trouble-prone.\nAt times, the last two had me mouthing a line from a country song: \"How\ncan I miss you if you won't go away?\"\nSince I delivered that report,\nall four holdings have grown significantly in value. The common stocks\nof both Gillette and First Empire have risen substantially, in line with\nthe companies' excellent performance. At yearend, the $600 million we put\ninto Gillette in 1989 had appreciated to $4.8 billion, and the $40 million\nwe committed to First Empire in 1991 had risen to $236 million.\nOur two laggards, meanwhile, have\ncome to life in a very major way. In a transaction that finally rewarded\nits long-suffering shareholders, Salomon recently merged into Travelers\nGroup. All of Berkshire's shareholders -- including me, very personally\n-- owe a huge debt to Deryck Maughan and Bob Denham for, first, playing\nkey roles in saving Salomon from extinction following its 1991 scandal\nand, second, restoring the vitality of the company to a level that made\nit an attractive acquisition for Travelers. I have often said that I wish\nto work with executives that I like, trust and admire. No two fit that\ndescription better than Deryck and Bob.\nBerkshire's final results from\nits Salomon investment won't be tallied for some time, but it is safe to\nsay that they will be far better than I anticipated two years ago. Looking\nback, I think of my Salomon experience as having been both fascinating\nand instructional, though for a time in 1991-92 I felt like the drama critic\nwho wrote: \"I would have enjoyed the play except that I had an unfortunate\nseat. It faced the stage.\"\nThe resuscitation of US Airways\nborders on the miraculous. Those who have watched my moves in this investment\nknow that I have compiled a record that is unblemished by success. I was\nwrong in originally purchasing the stock, and I was wrong later, in repeatedly\ntrying to unload our holdings at 50 cents on the dollar.\nTwo changes at the company coincided\nwith its remarkable rebound: 1) Charlie and I left the board of directors\nand 2) Stephen Wolf became CEO. Fortunately for our egos, the second event\nwas the key: Stephen Wolf's accomplishments at the airline have been phenomenal.\nThere still is much to do at US\nAirways, but survival is no longer an issue. Consequently, the company\nmade up the dividend arrearages on our preferred during 1997, adding extra\npayments to compensate us for the delay we suffered. The company's common\nstock, furthermore, has risen from a low of $4 to a recent high of $73.\nOur preferred has been called for\nredemption on March 15. But the rise in the company's stock has given our\nconversion rights, which we thought worthless not long ago, great value.\nIt is now almost certain that our US Airways shares will produce a decent\nprofit -- that is, if my cost for Maalox is excluded -- and the gain could\neven prove indecent.\nNext time I make a big, dumb decision,\nBerkshire shareholders will know what to do: Phone Mr. Wolf.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIn addition to the convertible\npreferreds, we purchased one other private placement in 1991, $300 million\nof American Express Percs. This security was essentially a common stock\nthat featured a tradeoff in its first three years: We received extra dividend\npayments during that period, but we were also capped in the price appreciation\nwe could realize. Despite the cap, this holding has proved extraordinarily\nprofitable thanks to a move by your Chairman that combined luck and skill\n-- 110% luck, the balance skill.\nOur Percs were due to convert into\ncommon stock in August 1994, and in the month before I was mulling whether\nto sell upon conversion. One reason to hold was Amex's outstanding CEO,\nHarvey Golub, who seemed likely to maximize whatever potential the company\nhad (a supposition that has since been proved -- in spades). But the size\nof that potential was in question: Amex faced relentless competition from\na multitude of card-issuers, led by Visa. Weighing the arguments, I leaned\ntoward sale.\nHere's where I got lucky. During\nthat month of decision, I played golf at Prouts Neck, Maine with Frank\nOlson, CEO of Hertz. Frank is a brilliant manager, with intimate knowledge\nof the card business. So from the first tee on I was quizzing him about\nthe industry. By the time we reached the second green, Frank had convinced\nme that Amex's corporate card was a terrific franchise, and I had decided\nnot to sell. On the back nine I turned buyer, and in a few months Berkshire\nowned 10% of the company.\nWe now have a $3 billion gain in\nour Amex shares, and I naturally feel very grateful to Frank. But George\nGillespie, our mutual friend, says that I am confused about where my gratitude\nshould go. After all, he points out, it was he who arranged the game and\nassigned me to Frank's foursome.\nQuarterly Reports to Shareholders\nIn last year's letter, I described\nthe growing costs we incur in mailing quarterly reports and the problems\nwe have encountered in delivering them to \"street-name\" shareholders.\nI asked for your opinion about the desirability of our continuing to print\nreports, given that we now publish our quarterly and annual communications\non the Internet, at our site, www.berkshirehathaway.com. Relatively few\nshareholders responded, but it is clear that at least a small number who\nwant the quarterly information have no interest in getting it off the Internet.\nBeing a life-long sufferer from technophobia, I can empathize with this\ngroup.\nThe cost of publishing quarterlies,\nhowever, continues to balloon, and we have therefore decided to send printed\nversions only to shareholders who request them. If you wish the quarterlies,\nplease complete the reply card that is bound into this report. In the meantime,\nbe assured that all shareholders will continue to receive the annual\nreport in printed form.\nThose of you who enjoy the computer\nshould check out our home page. It contains a large amount of current information\nabout Berkshire and also all of our annual letters since 1977. In addition,\nour website includes links to the home pages of many Berkshire subsidiaries.\nOn these sites you can learn more about our subsidiaries' products and\n-- yes -- even place orders for them.\nWe are required to file our quarterly\ninformation with the SEC no later than 45 days after the end of each quarter.\nOne of our goals in posting communications on the Internet is to make this\nmaterial information -- in full detail and in a form unfiltered by the\nmedia -- simultaneously available to all interested parties at a time when\nmarkets are closed. Accordingly, we plan to send our 1998 quarterly information\nto the SEC on three Fridays, May 15, August 14, and November 13, and on\nthose nights to post the same information on the Internet. This procedure\nwill put all of our shareholders, whether they be direct or \"street-name,\"\non an equal footing. Similarly, we will post our 1998 annual report on\nthe Internet on Saturday, March 13, 1999, and mail it at about the same\ntime.\nShareholder-Designated Contributions\nAbout 97.7% of all eligible shares\nparticipated in Berkshire's 1997 shareholder-designated contributions program.\nContributions made were $15.4 million, and 3,830 charities were recipients.\nA full description of the program appears on pages 52 - 53.\nCumulatively, over the 17 years\nof the program, Berkshire has made contributions of $113.1 million pursuant\nto the instructions of our shareholders. The rest of Berkshire's giving\nis done by our subsidiaries, which stick to the philanthropic patterns\nthat prevailed before they were acquired (except that their former owners\nthemselves take on the responsibility for their personal charities). In\naggregate, our subsidiaries made contributions of $8.1 million in 1997,\nincluding in-kind donations of $4.4 million.\nEvery year a few shareholders miss\nout on our contributions program because they don't have their shares registered\nin their own names on the prescribed record date or because they fail to\nget the designation form back to us within the 60-day period allowed. Charlie\nand I regret this. But if replies are received late, we have to reject\nthem because we can't make exceptions for some shareholders while refusing\nto make them for others.\nTo participate in future programs,\nyou must own Class A shares that are registered in the name of the actual\nowner, not the nominee name of a broker, bank or depository. Shares not\nso registered on August 31, 1998, will be ineligible for the 1998 program.\nWhen you get the contributions form from us, return it promptly so that\nit does not get put aside or forgotten.\nThe Annual Meeting\nWoodstock Weekend at Berkshire\nwill be May 2-4 this year. The finale will be the annual meeting, which\nwill begin at 9:30 a.m. on Monday, May 4. Last year we met at Aksarben\nColiseum, and both our staff and the crowd were delighted with the venue.\nThere was only one crisis: The night before the meeting, I lost my voice,\nthereby fulfilling Charlie's wildest fantasy. He was crushed when I showed\nup the next morning with my speech restored.\nLast year about 7,500 attended\nthe meeting. They represented all 50 states, as well as 16 countries, including\nAustralia, Brazil, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Greece. Taking into\naccount several overflow rooms, we believe that we can handle more than\n11,000 people, and that should put us in good shape this year even though\nour shareholder count has risen significantly. Parking is ample at Aksarben;\nacoustics are excellent; and seats are comfortable.\nThe doors will open at 7 a.m. on\nMonday and at 8:30 we will again feature the world premiere of a movie\nepic produced by Marc Hamburg, our CFO. The meeting will last until 3:30,\nwith a short break at noon. This interval will permit the exhausted to\nleave unnoticed and allow time for the hardcore to lunch at Aksarben's\nconcession stands. Charlie and I enjoy questions from owners, so bring\nup whatever is on your mind.\nBerkshire products will again be\nfor sale in the halls outside the meeting room. Last year -- not\nthat I pay attention to this sort of thing -- we again set sales records,\nmoving 2,500 pounds of See's candy, 1,350 pairs of Dexter shoes, $75,000\nof World Books and related publications, and 888 sets of Quikut knives.\nWe also took orders for a new line of apparel, featuring our Berkshire\nlogo, and sold about 1,000 polo, sweat, and T-shirts. At this year's meeting,\nwe will unveil our 1998 collection.\nGEICO will again be on hand with\na booth staffed by star associates from its regional offices. Find out\nwhether you can save money by shifting your auto insurance to GEICO. About\n40% of those who check us out learn that savings are possible. The proportion\nis not 100% because insurers differ in their underwriting judgments, with\nsome favoring drivers who live in certain geographical areas and work at\ncertain occupations more than we do. We believe, however, that we more\nfrequently offer the low price than does any other national carrier selling\ninsurance to all comers. In the GEICO informational material that accompanies\nthis report, you will see that in 38 states we now offer a special discount\nof as much as 8% to our shareholders. We also have applications pending\nthat would extend this discount to drivers in other states.\nAn attachment to the proxy material\nthat is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the card\nyou will need for admission to the meeting. We expect a large crowd, so\nget plane, hotel and car reservations promptly. American Express (800-799-6634)\nwill be happy to help you with arrangements. As usual, we will have buses\nat the larger hotels that will take you to and from the meeting and also\ndeliver you to Nebraska Furniture Mart, Borsheim's and the airport after\nits conclusion. You are likely, however, to find a car handy.\nNFM's main store, located on a\n75-acre site about a mile from Aksarben, is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.\non weekdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays, and noon to 6 p.m. on Sundays.\nDuring the period from May 1 to May 5, shareholders who present NFM with\nthe coupon that will accompany their meeting ticket will be entitled to\na discount that is otherwise restricted to its employees.\nBorsheim's normally is closed on\nSunday but will be open for shareholders from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on May\n3rd. Last year was our second-best shareholder's day, exceeded only by\n1996's. I regard this slippage as an anomaly and hope that you will prove\nme right this year. Charlie will be available for autographs. He smiles,\nhowever, only if the paper he signs is a Borsheim's sales ticket. Shareholders\nwho wish to visit on Saturday (10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.) or on Monday (10 a.m.-8\np.m.) should be sure to identify themselves as Berkshire owners so that\nSusan Jacques, Borsheim's CEO, can make you especially welcome. Susan,\nI should add, had a fabulous year in 1997. As a manager, she is everything\nthat an owner hopes for.\nOn Sunday afternoon we will also\nhave a special treat for bridge players in the mall outside of Borsheim's.\nThere, Bob Hamman -- a legend of the game for more than three decades --\nwill take on all comers. Join in and dazzle Bob with your skill.\nMy favorite steakhouse, Gorat's,\nopens one Sunday a year -- for Berkshire shareholders on the night before\nthe annual meeting. Last year the restaurant started serving at 4 p.m.\nand finished about 1:30 a.m, an endurance trial that was the result of\ntaking 1,100 reservations vs. a seating capacity of 235. If you make a\nreservation and then can't attend, be sure to let Gorat's know promptly,\nsince it goes to great effort to help us and we want to reciprocate. You\ncan make reservations beginning on April 1st (but not before) by\ncalling 402-551-3733. Last year I had to leave Gorat's a little early because\nof my voice problem, but this year I plan to leisurely savor every bite\nof my rare T-bone and double order of hash browns.\nAfter this warmup, Charlie and\nI will head for the Dairy Queen on 114th, just south of Dodge. There are\n12 great Dairy Queens in metropolitan Omaha, but the 114th Street location\nis the best suited to handle the large crowd that we expect. South of the\nproperty, there are hundreds of parking spaces on both sides of the street.\nAlso, this Dairy Queen will extend its Sunday hours to 11 p.m. in order\nto accommodate our shareholders.\nThe 114th Street operation is now\nrun by two sisters, Coni Birge and Deb Novotny, whose grandfather put up\nthe building in 1962 at what was then the outer edge of the city. Their\nmother, Jan Noble, took over in 1972, and Coni and Deb continue as third\ngeneration owner-managers. Jan, Coni and Deb will all be on hand Sunday\nevening, and I hope that you meet them. Enjoy one of their hamburgers if\nyou can't get into Gorat's. And then, around eight o'clock, join me in\nhaving a Dusty Sundae for dessert. This item is a personal specialty --\nthe Dairy Queen will furnish you a copy of my recipe -- and will be offered\nonly on Shareholder Sunday.\nThe Omaha Royals and Albuquerque\nDukes will play baseball on Saturday evening, May 2nd, at Rosenblatt Stadium.\nAs usual, your Chairman, shamelessly exploiting his 25% ownership of the\nteam, will take the mound. But this year you will see something new.\nIn past games, much to the bafflement\nof the crowd, I have shaken off the catcher's first call. He has consistently\nasked for my sweeping curve, and I have just as regularly resisted. Instead,\nI have served up a pathetic fast ball, which on my best day was clocked\nat eight miles per hour (with a following wind).\nThere's a story behind my unwillingness\nto throw the curve ball. As some of you may know, Candy Cummings invented\nthe curve in 1867 and used it to great effect in the National Association,\nwhere he never won less than 28 games in a season. The pitch, however,\ndrew immediate criticism from the very highest of authorities, namely Charles\nElliott, then president of Harvard University, who declared, \"I have\nheard that this year we at Harvard won the baseball championship because\nwe have a pitcher who has a fine curve ball. I am further instructed that\nthe purpose of the curve ball is to deliberately deceive the batter. Harvard\nis not in the business of teaching deception.\" (I'm not making this\nup.)\nEver since I learned of President\nElliott's moral teachings on this subject, I have scrupulously refrained\nfrom using my curve, however devastating its effect might have been on\nhapless batters. Now, however, it is time for my karma to run over Elliott's\ndogma and for me to quit holding back. Visit the park on Saturday night\nand marvel at the majestic arc of my breaking ball.\nOur proxy statement includes information\nabout obtaining tickets to the game. We will also provide an information\npacket describing the local hot spots, including, of course, those 12 Dairy\nQueens.\nCome to Omaha -- the cradle of\ncapitalism -- in May and enjoy yourself.\nWarren E. Buffett\nFebruary 27, 1998\nChairman of the Board",

    "text": "     *All figures used in this report apply to Berkshire's A shares, the successor to the only stock that the compan y\nhad outstanding before 1996.  The B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30th that of the A.\n3BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOur gain in net worth during 1998 was $25.9 billion, which increased the per-share book value of both our Class\nA and Class B stock by 48.3%.  Over the last 34 years (that is, si nce present management took over) per-share book value\nhas grown from $19 to $37,801, a rate of 24.7% compounded annually.*\nNormally, a  gain of 48.3% would call for handsprings — but not this year.  Remember Wagner, whose music\nhas been described  as better than it sounds?  Well, Berkshire’s progress in 1998 — though more than satisfactory — was not\nas good as it looks.  That’s because most of that 48.3% gain came from our issuing shares in acquisitions.\nTo explain: Our sto ck sells at a large premium over book value, which means that any issuing of shares we do\n— whether for cash or as consi deration in a merger — instantly increases our per-share book-value figure, even though\nwe’ve earned not a dime.  What h appens is that we get more per-share book value in such transactions than we give up.\nThese transactions, however, do not deliver us any immediate gain in per-share intrinsic value , because in this respect\nwhat we give and what we get are rough ly equal.  And, as Charlie Munger, Berkshire’s Vice Chairman and my partner,\nand I can’t tell you too often (though you may feel that we try ), it’s the per-share gain in intrinsic value that counts rather\nthan the per-share gain in book  value.  Though Berkshire’s intrinsic value grew very substantially in 1998, the gain fell\nwell short of the 48.3% recor ded for book value.  Nevertheless, intrinsic value still far exceeds book value.  (For a more\nextensive discussion of these terms, and other investment and accounting concepts, please refer to our Owner’s Manual,\non pages 56-64, in which we set forth our owner-related busi ness principles.  Intrinsic value is discussed on pages 61 and\n62.)\nWe entered 1999 with the best collection of businesses and managers in our history.  The two companies we\nacquired  in 1998,  General Re and Executive Jet, are first-class in every way — more about both later — and th e\nperformance of our operating businesses last year exceeded my hopes.  GEICO, once again, simply shot the lights out.\nOn the minus side, several of the public companies in which we have major i nvestments experienced significant operating\nshortfalls that neither they nor I  anticipat ed early in the year.  Consequently, our equity portfolio did not perform nearly\nas well as did the S&P 500.  The probl ems of these companies are almost certainly temporary, and Charlie and I believe\nthat their long-term prospects are excellent.\nIn our last three annual reports, we furnished you a table that we regard as central to estimating Berkshire' s\nintrinsic value.  In the updated version of th at table, which follows, we trace our two key components of value, including\nGeneral  Re on a pro-forma basis as if we had owned it throughout the year.  The first column lists our per-shar e\nownership of investments (including cash and equivalents but excluding securities held in our financial product s\noperation) and the secon d column shows our per-share earnings from Berkshire's operating businesses before taxes and\npurchase-accounting  adjustments (discussed on pages 62 and 63), but after all interest and corporate expenses.  Th e\nsecond column excludes  all dividends, interest and capital gains that we realized from the investments presented in the\nfirst column.  In effect, the columns show how Berkshire would look if it were split into two parts, with one entity holding\nour investments and the other operating all of our businesses and bearing all corporate costs.\n\n4Pre-tax Earnings Per Share\nInvestments With All Income from\nYear Per Share Investments Excluded\n1968........................................... $     53 $  2.87\n1978...........................................       465   12.85\n1988...........................................    4,876 145.77\n1998...........................................       47,647                    474.45\nHere are the growth rates of the two segments by decade:\nPre-tax Earnings Per Share\nInvestments With All Income from\nDecade Ending Per Share Investments Excluded\n1978........................................... 24.2% 16.2%\n1988........................................... 26.5% 27.5%\n1998........................................... 25.6% 12.5%\nAnnual Growth Rate, 1968-1998 ......................  25.4% 18.6%\nDuring 1998, our investments increased by $9,604 per share, or 25.2%, but per-share operating earnings fell by\n33.9%.  General Re (included, as noted, on a pro-forma basis) explains both facts.  This company has very larg e\ninvestments, and these greatly increas ed our per-share investment figure.  But General Re also had an underwriting loss\nin 1998, and that hurt operating earnings.  Had we not acquired General Re, per-share operating earnings would have\nshown a modest gain.\nThough certain of our acquisitions and operating str ategies may from time to time affect one column more than the\nother, we continually work t o increase the figures in both.  But one thing is certain: Our future rates of gain will fall far\nshort of those achieved in the past.  Berkshire’s capital base is now simply too large to allow us to earn truly outsized\nreturns.  If you believe otherwise, you should consider a career in sales but avoid one in mathematics (bearing in mind\nthat there are really only three kinds of people in the world: those who can count and those who can’t).\nCurrent ly we are working to compound a net worth of $57.4 billion, the largest of any American corporatio n\n(though our figure will be eclipsed if the merg er of Exxon and Mobil takes place).  Of course, our lead in net worth  does\nnot mean that Berkshire outranks all other businesses in value: Market value is what counts for owners and Genera l\nElectric and Mic rosoft, for example, have valuations more than three times Berkshire’s.  Net worth, though,  measures\nthe capital that managers must deploy, and at Berkshire that figure has indeed become huge.\nNonetheless,  Charlie and I will do our best to increase intrinsic value in the future at an average rate of 15%, a\nresult we consider to be at the very peak of possible outcomes.  We may have years when we exceed 15%, but we will\nmost certainly have oth er years when we fall far short of that — including years showing negative returns — and those\nwill bring our average down.  In the meantime, you should understand just what an average gain of 15% over the next\nfive year s implies: It means we will need to increase net worth by $58 billion.  Earning this daunting 15% will require\nus to come up with b ig ideas: Popcorn stands just won’t do.  Today’s markets are not friendly to our search fo r\n“elephants,” but you can be sure that we will stay  focused on the hunt.\nWhatever the future holds, I make you one prom ise: I’ll keep at least 99% of my net worth in Berkshire for as long\nas I am around.  How long will that be?  My model is the loyal Democrat in Fort Wayne who asked to be buried i n\nChicago so that he could stay active in the party.  To that end, I’ve already selected a “power spot” at the office for my\nurn.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nOur financial growth has been matched by employment growth: We now have 47,566 on our payroll, with th e\nacquisitions of 1998 bringing 7,074 employees to us and internal growth adding another 2,500.  To balance this gain \n\n5of 9,500 in hands-on employees, we have enla rged the staff at world headquarters from 12 to 12.8.  (The .8 doesn’t refer\nto me or Charlie:  We have a new pers on in accounting, working four days a week.)  Despite this alarming trend toward\ncorporate bloat, our after-tax overhead l ast year was about $3.5 million, or well under  one basis point (.01 of 1%) of the\nvalue of the assets we manage.\nTaxes\nOne beneficiary of our increased size has been the U.S. Treasury.  The federal income taxes that Berkshire an d\nGeneral Re have paid, or  will soon pay, in respect to 1998 earnings total $2.7 billion.  That means we shouldered all of\nthe U.S. Government’s expenses for more than a half-day.\nFollow that thought a little further: If only 625 other U.S. taxpayers had paid the Treasury as much as we an d\nGeneral Re did last year, no one else — neither corporations nor 270 million citizens — would have had to pay federal\nincome taxes or any other kind of federal tax (for example, social security or estate taxes).  Our shareholders can truly\nsay that they “gave at the office.”\nWriting checks to the IRS tha t include strings of zeros does not bother Charlie or me.  Berkshire as a corporation,\nand we as individuals, have prospered in America as we would have in no other country.  Indeed, if we lived in some\nother part of the world and completely escaped taxes, I’m sure we wou ld be worse off financially (and in many other ways\nas well).  Overall, we feel extraordinarily lucky to have been dealt a hand in life that enables us to write large checks to\nthe government rather than one requiring the gov ernment to regularly write checks to us — say, because we are disabled\nor unemployed.\nBerkshire’ s tax situation is sometimes misunderstood.  First, capital gains have no special attraction for us: A\ncorporation pays a  35% rate on taxable income, whether it comes from capital gains or from ordinary operations.  This\nmeans that Berkshire’s tax on a long-term capital gain is fully 75% higher than what an individual would pay on a n\nidentical gain.\nSome people harbor another misconception, believing that we can exclude 70% of all dividends we receive from\nour taxable income .  Indeed, the 70% rate applies to most corporations and also applies to Berkshire in cases where we\nhold stocks in non-insurance subsidiaries.  However, almost all of our equity investments are owned by  our insurance\ncompanies, and in that case the exclusion is 59 .5%.  That still means a dollar of dividends is considerably more valuable\nto us than a dollar of ordinary income, but not to the degree often assumed.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nBerkshire truly went all out f or the Treasury last year.  In connection with the General Re merger, we wrote a $30\nmillion check t o the government to pay an SEC fee tied to the new shares created by the deal.  We understand that this\npayment  set an SEC record.  Charlie and I are enormous admirers of what the Commission has accomplished fo r\nAmerican investors.  We would rather, however, have found another way to show our admiration.\nGEICO (1-800-847-7536)\nCombine a great idea w ith a great manager and you’re certain to obtain a great result.  That mix is alive and well\nat GEICO.  The idea is low-cost auto insurance, made possible by d irect-to-customer marketing, and the manager is Tony\nNicely.  Quite simply,  there is no one in the business world who could run GEICO better than Tony does.  His instincts\nare unerring, his energy is boundless, and his execution is flawless.  While maintaining underwriting discipline, Tony\nis building an organization that is gaining market share at an accelerating rate.\nThis pace has been encouraged by our compensation policies.  The direct writing of insurance — that is, without\nthere bein g an agent or broker between the insurer and its policyholder — involves a substantial front-end investment.\nFirst-year business is theref ore unprofitable in a major way.  At GEICO, we do not wish this cost to deter our associates\nfrom the aggressive pursuit  of new business — which, as it renews, will deliver significant profits  — so we leave it out\nof our compensation formulas.  What’s included then?  We base 50% of our associates’ bonuses and profit sharing on\n\n6the earnings of our “seasoned” book, meaning policies that have been with us for more than a year.  The other 50% is\ntied to growth in policyholders — and here we have stepped on the gas.\nIn 1995, the year prior to its acquisition by Berkshire, GEICO spent $33 million on marketing and had 65 2\ntelephone  counselors.  Last year the company spent $143 million, and the counselor count grew to 2,162.  The effects\nthat these efforts had at the company are shown by the new business and in-force figures below:\nNew Auto Auto Policies\nYears       Policies*         In-Force*\n1993 1,354,882 2,011,055\n1994 1,396,217 2,147,549\n1995 1,461,608 2,310,037\n1996 1,617,669 2,543,699\n1997 1,913,176 2,949,439\n1998 1,317,761 3,562,644\n* “Voluntary” only; excludes assigned risks and the like.\nIn 1999, we will again increase our marketing budget, spending at least $190 million.  In fact, there is no limit to\nwhat Berkshire is willing to invest in GEICO’s new-business activity, as long as we can concurrently build th e\ninfrastructure the company needs to properly serve its policyholders.\nBecause of the first-year costs, companies that are concerned about quarterly or annual earnings would shy from\nsimilar investments, no matter how intelligent these might be in terms of building long-term value.  Our calculus i s\ndifferent:  We simply measure whether we are creating more than a dollar of value per dollar spent — and if tha t\ncalculation is favorable, the more dollars we spend the happier I am.\nThere is far more to GEICO’s success, of course, than low prices and a torrent of advertising.  The handling o f\nclaims must also be fair, fast and friendly — and ours is.  Here’s an impartial scorecard on how we shape up: In New\nYork, our lar gest-volume state, the Insurance Department recently reported that GEICO’s complaint ratio in 1997 was\nnot only the lowest of the five largest auto insurers but was also less than half the average of the other four.\nGEICO’s  1998 profit margin of 6.7% was better than we had anticipated — and, indeed, better than we wished.\nOur results reflect an industry-wide phenomen on: In recent years, both the frequency of auto accidents and their severity\nhave unexpectedly declined.  We responded by red ucing rates 3.3% in 1998, and we will reduce them still more in 1999.\nThese moves will soon bring profit margins down — at the least to 4%, which is our target, and perhaps considerably\nlower.  Whatever the case, we believe that our margins will continue to be much better than those of the industry.\nWith GEICO’s growth and profitability both outstanding in 1998, so also were its profit-sharing and bonu s\npayments.  Indeed, the prof it-sharing payment of $103 million or 32.3% of salary — which went to all 9,313 associates\nwho had been with us for more than a year — may  well have been the highest percentage payment at any large company\nin the country.  (In addition, associates benefit from a company-funded pension plan.)\nThe 32.3% may turn out to be a high-water mark, given that the profitability component in our profit-sharin g\ncalculation is almost c ertain to come down in the future.  The growth component, though,  may well increase.  Overall,\nwe expect the two benchmarks togeth er to dictate very significant profit-sharing payments for decades to come.  For our\nassociates, growth pays off in other ways as well: Last year we promoted 4,612 people.\nImpressive as the GEICO figures are, we have far more to do.  Our market share improved significantly in 1998\n— but only from 3% to 3½%.  Fo r every policyholder we now have, there are another ten who should be giving us their\nbusiness.\nSome of you who are reading this  may be in that category.  About 40% of those who check our rates find that they\ncan save money by doing business with us.  The proportion is not 100% because insurers differ in their underwritin g\njudgements, with some giving more credit than we do to d rivers who live in certain geographical areas or work at certain\noccupations.   We believe, however, that we more frequently offer the low price than does any other national carrie r\n\n7selling insurance to all comers.  Furthermore, in 40 states we can offer a special discount — usually 8% — to ou r\nshareholders.  So give us a call and check us out.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nYou may think that one commercial in this section is enough.  But I have another to present, this one directed at\nmanagers of publicly-owned companies.\nAt Berkshire we feel that telling outstandin g CEOs, such as Tony, how to run their companies would be the height\nof foolishness.  Most of ou r managers wouldn’t work for us if they got a lot of backseat driving.   (Generally, they don’t\nhave to work for anyone, since 75% or so are independently wealthy.)  Besides, they are the Mark McGwires of th e\nbusiness world and need no advice from us as to how to hold the bat or when to swing.\nNeverthele ss, Berkshire’s ownership may make even the best of managers more effective.  First, we eliminate all\nof the ritualistic and nonproduc tive activities that normally go with the job of CEO.  Our managers are totally in charge\nof their personal schedules.  Second, we give each a simple mission: Just run your business as if: 1) you own 100% of\nit; 2) it is the only asset in the world that you and your family have or will ever have; and 3) you can’t sell or merge it\nfor at least a cent ury.  As a corollary, we tell them they should not let any of their decisions be affected even slightly by\naccounting considerations.  We want our managers to think about what counts, not how it will be counted.\nVery few CEOs of public companies operate u nder a similar mandate, mainly because they have owners who focus\non short-term prospects and reported earnings.  Berkshire, however, has a shareholder base — which it will have fo r\ndecades  to come — that has the longest investment horizon to be found in the public-company universe.  Indeed, a\nmajority  of our shares are held by investors who expect to die still holding them.  We can therefore ask our CEOs t o\nmanage  for maximum long-term value, rather than for next quarter’s earnings.  We certainly don’t ignore the current\nresults of our business es — in most cases, they are of great importance — but we never want them to be achieved at the\nexpense of our building ever-greater competitive strengths.\nI believe t he GEICO story demonstrates the benefits of Berkshire’s approach.  Charlie and I haven’t taught Tony\na thing — and never will —  but we  have created an environment that allows him to apply all of his talents to what’s\nimportant.  He does not have to devote his time or energy to board meetings,  press interviews, presentations by investment\nbankers or  talks with financial analysts.  Furthermore, he need never spend a moment thinking about financing, credit\nratings or “Street” expectations for earnings per share.  Because of our ownership structure, he also knows that thi s\noperational  framework will endure for decades to come.  In this environment of freedom, both Tony and his company\ncan convert their almost limitless potential into matching achievements.\nIf you are running a large, profitable  business that will thrive in a GEICO-like environment, check our acquisition\ncriteria  on page 21 and give me a call.  I promise a fast answer and will mention your inquiry to no one excep t\nCharlie.\nExecutive Jet Aviation (1-800-848-6436)\nTo understand the huge potential at Executive Jet Aviation (EJA), you need some understanding of its business,\nwhich is selling fractional shares of jets and op erating the fleet for its many owners.  Rich Santulli, CEO of EJA, created\nthe fractional ownership industry in 1986, by visual izing an important new way of using planes.  Then he combined guts\nand talent to turn his idea into a major business.\nIn a fractional owner ship plan, you purchase a portion — say /8th — of any of a wide variety of jets that EJ A1\noffers.  That purchase entitles you to 100 hours of flying time annually.  (“Dead-head” hours don’t count against your\nallotme nt, and you are also allowed to average your hours over five years.)  In addition, you pay both a monthl y\nmanagement fee and a fee for hours actually flown.\nThen, on a few hours not ice, EJA makes your plane, or another at least as good, available to you at your choice of\nthe 5500 airports in the U.S.  In effect, calling up your plane is like phoning for a taxi. \n\n8I first heard abo ut the NetJets® program, as it is called, about four years ago from Frank Rooney, our manager at\nH.H. Brown.  Frank ha d used and been delighted with the service and suggested that I meet Rich to investigate signing\nup for my family’s use.  It took Rich about 15 minutes to sell me a quarter (200 hours annually) of a Hawker 1000.  Since\nthen, my family has learned firsthand — through flying 900 hours on 300 trips — what a friendly, efficient, and safe\noperation  EJA runs .  Quite simply, they love this service.  In fact, they quickly grew so enthusiastic  that I did a\ntestimonial ad for EJA l ong before I knew there was any possibility of our purchasing the business.  I did, however, ask\nRich to give me a call if he ever got interested in selling.  Luckily, he phoned me last May, and we quickly made a $725\nmillion deal, paying equal amounts of cash and stock.\nEJA, which is by far the largest operator in its in dustry, has more than 1,000 customers and 163 aircraft (including\n23 “core” aircraft that are owned or leased by EJA itself, so that it can make sure that service is first-class even during\nthe times when demand i s heaviest).  Safety, of course, is the paramount issue in any flight operation, and Rich’s pilots\n— now numbering about 650 — receive e xtensive training at least twice a year from FlightSafety International, another\nBerkshire subsidiary and the wor ld leader in pilot training.  The bottom line on our pilots: I’ve sold the Berkshire plane\nand will now do all of my business flying, as well as my personal flying, with NetJets’ crews.\nBeing the lead er in this industry is a major advantage for all concerned.  Our customers gain because we have an\narmada of planes positioned throughout the country at all times, a blanket ing that allows us to provide unmatched service.\nMeanwh ile, we gain from the blanketing because it reduces dead-head costs.  Another compelling attraction for ou r\nclients is t hat we offer products from Boeing, Gulfstream, Falcon, Cessna, and Raytheon, whereas our two competitors\nare owned by manufactu rers that offer only their own planes.  In effect, NetJets is like a physician who can recommend\nwhatever medicine best fits the needs of each patien t; our competitors, in contrast, are producers of  a “house” brand that\nthey must prescribe for one and all.\nIn many cases our clients, both corporate and individual, o wn fractions of several different planes and can therefore\nmatch spec ific planes to specific missions.  For example, a client might own /16th of three different jets (each giving it1\n50 hours of flying time), which in total give it a virtual fleet, obtained for a small fraction of the cost of a single plane.\nSignificantly, it is not only small businesses that can benefit from fractiona l ownership.  Already, some of America’s\nlargest companies use NetJets as a supplement to their own fleet.  This saves them big money in both meeting pea k\nrequirements and in flying missions that would require their wholly-owned planes to log a disproportionate amount of\ndead-head hours.\nWhen a plane is slated for personal use, the clinching argument is t hat either the client signs up now or his children\nlikely will  later.  That’s an equation I explained to my wonderful Aunt Alice 40 years ago when she asked me whether\nshe could afford a fur coat.  My reply settled the issue: “Alice, you aren’t buying it; your heirs are.”\nEJA’s growth ha s been explosive: In 1997, it accounted for 31% of all corporate jets ordered in the world .\nNonetheless, Rich and I believe  that the potential of fractional ownership has barely been scratched.  If many thousands\nof owners find it sensible to own 100% of a plane — which must be used 350-400 hours annually if it’s  to mak e\neconomic sense — there must be a large multiple of that number for whom fractional ownership works.\nIn addition to being a terrific executive, Rich is fun.  Like most of our managers, he has no economic nee d\nwhatsoever  to work.  Rich spends his time at EJA because it’s his baby — and he wants to see how far he can take it.\nWe both already know the answer, both literally and figuratively: to the ends of the earth.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAnd now a small h int to Berkshire directors: Last year I spent more than nine times my salary at Borsheim’s and\nEJA.  Just think how Berkshire’s business would boom if you’d only spring for a raise.\n\n9General Re\nOn December 21, we completed our $22 billion acquisition of General Re Corp.  In addition to owning 100% of\nGeneral Reinsurance Corpor ation, the largest U.S. property-casualty reinsurer, the company also owns (including stock\nit has an arrangement to buy) 82% of the oldest reinsurance company in the world, Cologne Re.  The two companies\ntogether reinsure all lines of insurance and operate in 124 countries.\nFor many decades, General Re’s name has stood for quality, integrity and professionalism in reinsurance — and\nunder R on Ferguson’s leadership, this reputation has been burnished still more.  Berkshire can add absolutely nothing\nto the skills of General Re’s and Cologne Re’s managers.  On the contrary, there is a lot that they can teach us.\nNevertheless, we believe that Berkshire’s ownership will benefit  General Re in important ways and that its earnings\na decade from now will materially exceed those that would have been attainable absent the merger.  We base thi s\noptimism on the fact that we can offer General Re’s management a freedom to  operate in whatever manner will best allow\nthe company to exploit its strengths.\nLet’s look for a moment at the reinsurance business to understand why General Re could not on its own do what\nit can under Berkshire.  Most  of the demand for reinsurance comes from primary insurers who want to escape  the wide\nswings in earnings that result f rom large and unusual losses.  In effect, a reinsurer gets paid for absorbing the  volatility\nthat the client insurer wants to shed.\nIronically, though, a publicly-held reinsurer ge ts graded by both its owners and those who evaluate its credit on the\nsmoothness of i ts own results.  Wide swings in earnings hurt both credit ratings and p/e ratios, even when the business\nthat produces such swings has an expectancy of satisfactory profits over time.  This market reality sometimes causes a\nreinsurer to make costly moves, among them laying o ff a significant portion of the business it writes (in transactions that\nare called “retrocessions”) or rejecting good business simply because it threatens to bring on too much volatility.\nBerkshire, in contrast, happily accepts volatility, just as long as it carries with it the expectation of increased  profits\nover time.  Furthermore, we are a Fort Knox of capital, and that means volatile earnings can’t impair our premier credit\nratings.  Thus we have the perfect structure for writing — and retaining  — reinsurance in virtually any amount.  In fact,\nwe’ve used this strength over the past decade to build a powerful super-cat business.\nWhat General  Re gives us, however, is the distribution force, technical facilities and management that will allow\nus to employ our structural strength in every facet of the industry.  In particular, General Re and Cologne Re can now\naccelerate their push into international markets, w here the preponderance of industry growth will almost certainly occur.\nAs the merger proxy statement spelled out, Berkshire also brings tax and investment benefits to General Re.  But the most\ncompelling  reason for the merger is simply that General Re’s outstanding management can now do what it does best,\nunfettered by the constraints that have limited its growth.\nBerkshire is assuming responsib ility for General Re’s investment portfolio, though not for Cologne Re’s.  We will\nnot, howe ver, be involved in General Re’s underwriting.  We will simply ask the company to exercise the discipline of\nthe past while increasing the proportion of its business that is retained, expanding its product line, and widening it s\ngeographical  coverage — making these moves in recognition of Berkshire’s financial strength and tolerance for wide\nswings in earnings.  As we’ve long said, we prefer a lumpy 15% return to a smooth 12%.\nOver time, Ron and his team will maximize General Re’s new potential.  He and I have known each other fo r\nmany years, and each of our companies has initiated significant business that it has reinsured with the other.  Indeed,\nGeneral Re played a key role in the resuscitation of GEICO from its near-death status in 1976.\nBoth Ron and Rich Santulli plan to be at the annual meeting, and I hope you get a chance to say hello to them.\n\n10The Economics of Property-Casualty Insurance\nWith the acquisition of General Re — and with GEICO’s business mush rooming — it becomes more important than ever\nthat you unde rstand how to evaluate an insurance company.  The key determinants are: (1) the amount of float that th e\nbusiness generates; (2) its cost; and (3) most important of all, the long-term outlook for both of these factors.\nTo begin with, float is money we hold but d on't own.  In an insurance operation, float arises because premiums are\nreceived before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes exten ds over many years.  During that time, the insurer invests\nthe money.  Typically, this pleasant activity carries with it a downside:  The premiums that an insurer takes in usually\ndo not cover the losses and expense s it eventually must pay.  That leaves it running an \"underwriting loss,\" which is the\ncost of float.  An in surance business has value if its cost of float over time is less than the cost the company woul d\notherwise incur to obtain funds.  But the business is a lemon if its cost of float is higher than market rates for money.\nA cautio n is appropriate here:  Because loss costs must be estimated, insurers have enormous latitude in figuring\ntheir underwriting results, and that makes it very difficult for investors to calculate a company's true cost of float.  Errors\nof estimation, usually innocent but sometimes no t, can be huge.  The consequences of these miscalculations flow directly\ninto earnin gs.  An experienced observer can usually detect large-scale errors in reserving, but the general public ca n\ntypically do no more than accept what's presented, and at times I have been amazed by the numbers that big-nam e\nauditors have implicitly blessed.  As for Berkshire, Charlie and I att empt to be conservative in presenting its underwriting\nresults to you, because we have found that virtually all surprises in insurance are unpleasant ones.\nThe table that follows shows the fl oat generated by Berkshire’s insurance operations since we entered the business\n32 years a go.  The data are for every fifth year and also the last, which includes General Re’s huge float.  For the table\nwe have calculated our float — which we generate in large amounts relative to our premium volume — by adding net\nloss reserves, loss adjustment reserves, f unds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned premium reserves, and then\nsubtracting agents balances, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid taxes and deferred charges applicable to assume d\nreinsurance.  (Got that?)\nYear Average Float\n(in $ millions)\n1967    17\n1972    70\n1977   139\n1982   221\n1987 1,267\n1992 2,290\n1997 7,093\n1998              22,762 (yearend)\nImpressive  as the growth in our float has been — 25.4% compounded annually — what really counts is the cost\nof this item.  If that becomes too high, growth in float becomes a curse rather than a blessing.  \nAt Berkshire, the news is all good: Our average cost over the 32 years has been well under zero.  In aggregate, we\nhave posted a substantial underwriting profit, which means that we have been paid for holding a large and growin g\namount of money.  This is the best of all worlds.  Indeed, though our net float is recorded on our balance sheet as a\nliability, it has had more economic value to us than an equal amount of net worth would have had.  As long as we can\ncontinue to achieve an underwriting profit, float will continue to outrank net worth in value.\nDuring the next few years, Berkshire’s growth in float may well be modest.  The reinsurance market is soft, and\nin this business, relationships change slowly.  Therefore, General Re’s float — /3rds of our total — is unlikely t o2\nincrease significantly in the near term.  We do expect, however, that our cost of float will remain very attractive compared\nto that of other insurers.\n\n11Sources of Reported Earnings\nThe table that follows shows the main sources of Berkshire's reported earnings.  In this presentation, purchase -\naccounting adjustments are not assigned to the specific businesses to which they apply, but are instead aggregated and\nshown separately.  This procedure lets  you view the earnings of our businesses as they would have been reported had we\nnot purchased them.  For the reasons discussed on pages 62 and 63, this form of presentation seems to us to be mor e\nuseful to investors and managers than one utilizing generally-accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requir e\npurchase-premiums  to be charged off business-by-business.  The total earnings we show in the table are, of course ,\nidentical to the GAAP total in our audited financial statements.\n(in millions)\n     Berkshire’s Share\n     of Net Earnings\n     (after taxes and\n    Pre-Tax Earnings      minority interests)\n1998 1997 1998 1997\nOperating Earnings:\n  Insurance Group:\n    Underwriting — Super-Cat .................. $154 $283 $100 $183\n    Underwriting — Other Reinsurance ...........

(2)       (4)\nYou can be proud of our operating managers.  They almost invariably deliver earnings that are at the very top of\nwhat conditions in their industries allow, meanwhile fortifying their businesses’ long-term competitive strengths.  I n\naggregate, they have created many billions of dollars of value for you.\nAn example: In my 1994 lett er, I reported on Ralph Schey’s extraordinary performance at Scott Fetzer.  Little did\nI realize that he was just warming up.  Last year Scott Fetzer, operating with no leverage (except for a conservative level\nof debt in its finance subsidiary), earned a record $96.5 million after-tax on its $112 million net worth.\n\n12Today, Berkshire  has an unusually large number of individuals, such as Ralph, who are truly legends in thei r\nindustries.   Many of these joined us when we purchased their companies, but in recent years we have also identified a\nnumber of strong managers internally.  We further expanded our cor ps of all-stars in an important way when we acquired\nGeneral Re and EJA.\nCharlie and I have the easy jobs at Berk shire: We do very little except allocate capital.  And, even then, we are not\nall that energetic.  We have one excuse, though: In allocating capital, activity does not correlate with achievement .\nIndeed, in the fields of investments and acquisitions, frenetic behavior is often counterproductive.  Therefore, Charlie\nand I mainly just wait for the phone to ring.\nOur managers, however, work very hard — and it shows.  Naturally, they want to be paid fairly for their efforts,\nbut pay alone can’t explain their extraordinary ac complishments.  Instead, each is primarily motivated by a vision of just\nhow far his or her bus iness can go — and by a desire to be the one who gets it there.  Charlie and I thank them on your\nbehalf and ours.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAdditional information about our various businesses is give n on pages 39-53,  where you will also find our segment\nearnings  reported on a GAAP basis.  In addition, on pages 65-71,  we have rearranged Berkshire's financial data into\nfour segments on a non-GAAP basis, a presentation that corresponds to the way Charlie and I think about the company.\nNormally,  we follow this section with one on “Look-Through” Earnings.  Because the General Re acquisitio n\noccurred near yearend, though, neither a historical nor a pro-forma calculation of a 1998 number seems relevant.  We\nwill resume the look-through calculation in next year’s report. \nInvestments\nBelow we present our common stock investments.

However, we trimmed or substantially cut many of our smaller\npositions.  Here , I need to make a confession (ugh):  The portfolio actions I took in 1998 actually decrease d our\ngain for the year.  In particular, my decision to sell M cDonald’s was a very big mistake.  Overall, you would have\nbeen better off last year if I had regularly snuck off to the movies during market hours.\n\n13At yearend, we held more than $15 billion in cash equivalents (including high-grade securities due in less\nthan one year).  Cash never makes us happy.  But it’s better to have the money burning a hole in Berkshire’ s\npocket than r esting comfortably in someone else’s.  Charlie and I will continue our search for large equit y\ninvestments  or, better yet, a really major business acquisition that would absorb our liquid assets.  Currently ,\nhowever, we see nothing on the horizon.\nOnce we knew that the General Re merger would definitely take place, we asked the company to dispose of\nthe equities that it held.  (As mentioned earlier, we  do not manage the Cologne Re portfolio, which includes many\nequities.)  General Re subsequently eliminated its positions in about 250 common stocks, incurring $935 million\nof taxes in the process.  This “clean sweep” approach reflects a basic principle that Charlie and I employ i n\nbusiness and investing: We don’t back into decisions.\nLast year I deviated from my standard practice of not disclosing our investments (other than those we are\nlegally required to report) and told  you about three unconventional investments we had made.  There were several\nreasons  behind that disclosure.  First, questions about our silver position that we had received from regulator y\nauthorities  led us to believe that they wished us to publicly acknowledge this investment.  Second, our holdings\nof zero- coupon bonds were so large that we wanted our owners to know of this investment’s potential impact on\nBerkshire’s net worth.  Third, we simply wanted to alert you to the fact tha t we sometimes do make unconventional\ncommitments.\nNormall y, however, as discussed in the Owner’s Manual on page 61, we see no advantage in talking about\nspecific investme nt actions.  Therefore — unless we again take a position that is particularly large — we will not\npost you as to what  we are doing in respect to any specific holding of an unconventional sort.  We can report,\nhowever, that we have eliminated certain of the positions discussed last year and added certain others.\nOur never-comment-even-if-untrue policy in regard to investments may disappoint “piggybackers” but wil l\nbenefit owners: Your Berkshire shares would be worth less if we discussed what we are doing.  Incidentally, we\nshould warn you that media speculation about our investment moves continues in most cases to be incorrect .\nPeople who rely on such commentary do so at their own peril.\nAccounting — Part 1\nOur General Re acquisition put a spotlight on an egregious flaw in accounting procedure.  Sharp-eye d\nshareholders  reading our proxy statement probably noticed an unusual item on page 60.  In the pro-form a\nstateme nt of income — which detailed how the combined 1997 earnings of the two entities would have bee n\naffected by the merger — there was a n item stating that compensation expense would have been increased by $63\nmillion.\nThis item, we hasten to add, does not signal that either Charlie or I have experienced a major personality\nchange.  (He still tr avels coach and quotes Ben Franklin.)  Nor does it indicate any shortcoming in General Re’s\naccounting  practices, which have followed GAAP to the letter.  Instead, the pro-forma adjustment came abou t\nbecause  we are replacing General Re’s longstanding stock option plan with a cash plan that ties the incentiv e\ncompensation of General Re managers to their operati ng achievements.  Formerly what counted for these managers\nwas General Re’s stock price; now their payoff will come from the business performance they deliver.\nThe new plan and the terminated option arrangement have matching economics, w hich means that the rewards\nthey deliver to employees should, for a given level of perform ance, be the same.  But what these people could have\nformerly  anticipated earning from new option grants will now be paid in cash.  (Options granted in past year s\nremain outstanding.)\nThough the two plans are an econo mic wash, the cash plan we are putting in will produce a vastly different\naccounting result.  This Alice-in-Wonderland outcome occurs because existing accounting principles ignore the cost\nof stock options when earnings are being calculated, even though options are a huge and increasing expense at a\ngreat many corporatio ns.  In effect, accounting principles offer management a choice: Pay employees in one form\nand count the cost, or p ay them in another form and ignore the cost.  Small wonder then that the use of options\n\n14has mushroomed.  This lop-sided choice has a big downside for owners, however: Though options, if properl y\nstructured, can be an appropriate, and even ideal , way to compensate and motivate top managers, they are more\noften wildly capricious in their distribution of rewards, inefficient as motivators, and inordinately expensive fo r\nshareholders.\nWhatever the merits of options may be, their accounting treatment  is outrageous.  Think for a moment of that\n$190 million we are  going to spend for advertising at GEICO this year.  Suppose that instead of paying cash for\nour ads, we paid the media in ten-year, at-the-market Berkshire options.  Would anyone then care to argu e\nthat Berkshire had not borne a cost for advertising, or should not be charged this cost on its books?\nPerhaps  Bishop Berkeley — you may remember him as the philosopher who mused about trees falling in a\nforest when no one was around —  would believe that an expense unseen by an accountant does not exist.  Charlie\nand I, however, have trouble being philosophical about unrecorded costs.  When we consider investing in an option-\nissuing company, we make an appropriate downward adjustment to r eported earnings, simply subtracting an amount\nequal to what the company could have realized by publicly selling options of like quantity and structure.  Similarly,\nif we contemplate an acquisition, w e include in our evaluation the cost of replacing any option plan.  Then, if we\nmake a deal, we promptly take that cost out of hiding.\nReaders who  disagree with me about options will by this time be mentally quarreling with my equating the\ncost of options issued to employees with those that might theoretically be sold and traded publicly.  It is true, to\nstate one of these arguments, that employee options are sometimes forfeited — that lessens the damage done to\nshareholders  — whereas publicly-offered options would not be.  It is true, also, that companies receive a ta x\ndeduction when employee options are exercised; publicly-traded options deliver no such benefit.  But there’s a n\noffset to these points: Options issued to employees are often r epriced, a transformation that makes them much more\ncostly than the public variety.\nIt’s sometimes argued that a non-transferable op tion given to an employee is less valuable to him than would\nbe a publicly-trade d option that he could freely sell.  That fact, however, does not reduce the cost of the non -\ntransferable option: Giving an employee a company car that can only be used for certain purposes diminishes its\nvalue to the employee, but does not in the least diminish its cost to the employer. \nThe earning revisions that Charlie and I have made for options in recent years have frequently cut th e\nreported per-s hare figures by 5%, with 10% not all that uncommon.  On occasion, the downward adjustment has\nbeen so great that it has affected our portfolio decisions, causing us either to make a sale or to pass on a stock\npurchase we might otherwise have made. \nA few y ears ago we asked three questions in these pages to which we have not yet received an answer: “If\noptions aren’t a form of compensation, what are they?  If compensation isn’t an expense, what is it?  And, i f\nexpenses shouldn’t go into the calculation of earnings, where in the world should they go?”\nAccounting — Part 2\nThe role that  managements have played in stock-option accounting has hardly been benign: A distressin g\nnumber of bot h CEOs and auditors have in recent years bitterly fought FASB’s attempts to replace option fiction\nwith truth and virtually none have spoken out in support of FASB.  Its opponents even enlisted Congress in the\nfight, pushing the case that inflated figures were in the national interest.\nStill, I believe that the behavior of managements has been even worse when it comes to restructurings and\nmerger accounting.  Here, many managements purposefully  work at manipulating numbers and deceiving investors.\nAnd, as Michael Kinsley has said about Washington: “The scandal isn’t in what’s done that’s illegal but rather\nin what’s legal.”\nIt was once relatively easy to tell the good guys in accounting from the bad: The late 1960's, for example,\nbrought on an orgy of what one charlatan dubbed “bold, imaginative accounting” (the practice of which ,\nincidentally, made him loved for a time by Wall St reet because he never missed expectations).  But most investors\n\n15of that period knew who was playing games.  And, to their credit, virtually all of America’s most-admire d\ncompanies then shunned deception.\nIn recent years, probity has eroded.  Many major cor porations still play things straight, but a significant and\ngrowing  number of otherwise high-grade managers — CEOs you would be happy to have as spouses for you r\nchildren or as trustees  under your will — have come to the view that it’s okay to manipulate earnings to satisfy\nwhat they believe are Wall Street’s desires.  Indeed, many CEOs  think this kind of manipulation is not only okay,\nbut actually their duty.\nThese managers start with the assumption, all too common, that their job at all times is to encourage the\nhighest stock price possible (a premise with which we adamantly disagree).  To pump the price, they strive ,\nadmirably, for operational excellence.  But whe n operations don’t produce the result hoped for, these CEOs resort\nto unadmirable accounting stratagems.  T hese either manufacture the desired “earnings” or set the stage for them\nin the future.\nRationalizing this behavior, these managers often say that their shareholders will be hurt if their currency\nfor doing deals — that is, their stock — is not fully-priced, and they also argue that in using accountin g\nshenanigans  to get the figures they want, they are only doing what everybody else does.  Once such a n\neverybody’s- doing-it  attitude takes hold, ethical misgivings vanish.  Call this behavior Son of Gresham: Ba d\naccounting drives out good.\nThe distortion du jour  is the “restructuring charge,” an accounting entry that can, of course, be legitimate\nbut that too often is a device for manipulating earnings.  In this bit of legerdemain, a large chunk of costs that\nshould properly be attributed t o a number of years is dumped into a single quarter, typically one already fated to\ndisappoint invest ors.  In some cases, the purpose of the charge is to clean up earnings misrepresentations of the\npast, and in ot hers it is to prepare the ground for future misrepresentations.  In either case, the size and timing\nof these charges is dictate d by the cynical proposition that Wall Street will not mind if earnings fall short by $5\nper share in a given quarter, just as long as this deficiency ensures that quarterly earnings in the future wil l\nconsistently exceed expectations by five cents per share.\nThis dump-everything-into-one-quarter behavior suggests a corresponding “bold, imaginative” approach t o\n— golf scores.  In his first round of the seas on, a golfer should ignore his actual performance and simply fill his\ncard with atrocious numbers — double, triple, quadruple bogey s — and then turn in a score of, say, 140.  Having\nestablishe d this “reserve,” he should go to the golf shop and tell his pro that he wishes to “restructure” hi s\nimperfect sw ing.  Next, as he takes his new swing onto the course, he should count his good holes, but not the\nbad ones.  These remnants from his old swing should be charged instead to the reserve established earlier.  At\nthe end of five rounds, then, his record will be 140, 80, 80, 80, 80 rather than 91, 94, 89, 94, 92.  On Wal l\nStreet, they will ignore the 140 — which, after all, came from a “discontinued” swing — and will classify our\nhero as an 80 shooter (and one who never disappoints).\nFor those who prefer to cheat up fro nt, there would be a variant of this strategy.  The golfer, playing alone\nwith a cooperative caddy-auditor, should defer the recording of bad holes, take four 80s, accept the plaudits he\ngets for such athleticism and consistency , and then turn in a fifth card carrying a 140 score.  After rectifying his\nearlier scorekeeping sins with this “big bath,” he may mumble a few apologies but will refrain from returning\nthe sums he has previously collected from comparing  scorecards in the clubhouse.  (The caddy, need we add, will\nhave acquired a loyal patron.)\nUnfortunately, CEOs who use variations of these sc oring schemes in real life tend to become addicted to the\ngames they’re playing — after all, it’ s easier to fiddle with the scorecard than to spend hours on the practice tee\n— and never muster  the will to give them up.  Their behavior brings to mind Voltaire’s comment on sexua l\nexperimentation: “Once a philosopher, twice a pervert.”\nIn the acq uisition arena, restructuring has been raised to an art form: Managements now frequently us e\nmergers to dishonestly rearrange the value of assets and liabilities in ways that will allow them to both smooth\nand swell future e arnings.  Indeed, at deal time, major auditing firms sometimes point out the possibilities for a\nlittle accounting magic (or for a lot).  Getting this push from the pulpit, first-class people will frequently stoop\n\n16to third-class  tactics.   CEOs understandably do not find it easy to reject auditor-blessed strategies that lead t o\nincreased future “earnings.”\nAn example from the property-casualty insurance industry will illuminate the possibilities.  When a p- c\ncompany is acquired, the buyer sometimes simultaneously increases its loss r eserves, often substantially.  This boost\nmay merely reflect the previous inadequacy of reserves — though it is u ncanny how often an actuarial “revelation”\nof this kin d coincides with the inking of a deal.  In any case, the move sets up the possibility of ‘earnings ”\nflowing into income at some later date, as reserves are released.\nBerkshire has kept entirely  clear of these practices: If we are to disappoint you, we would rather it be with\nour earnings than with our accounting.  In all of our acquisitions, we have left the loss reserve figures exactly\nas we found  them.  After all, we have consistently joined with insurance managers knowledgeable about thei r\nbusiness and honest in their financial reporting.  When deals occur in which liabilities are increased immediately\nand substantially, simple log ic says that at least one of those virtues must have been lacking — or, alternatively,\nthat the acquirer is laying the groundwork for future infusions of “earnings.”\nHere’s a true story that illustrates an all-too-common view in corporate America.  The CEOs of two large\nbanks, one of them a man who’d made many acquisitions, were involved not long ago in a friendly merge r\ndiscussion (which in  the end didn’t produce a deal).  The veteran acquirer was expounding on the merits of the\npossible combination, only to be skep tically interrupted by the other CEO: “But won’t that mean a huge charge,”\nhe asked, “perhaps as much as $1 billion?”  The “s ophisticate” wasted no words: “We’ll make it bigger than that\n— that’s why we’re doing the deal.”\nA preliminary tally by R. G. Associates, of Baltimore, of special charges taken or announced during 1998\n— that is, charges for restructuring, i n-process R&D, merger-related items, and write-downs — identified no less\nthan 1,369 of  these, totaling $72.1 billion.  That is a staggering amount as evidenced by this bit of perspective:\nThe 1997 earnings of the 500 companies in Fortune’s famous list totaled $324 billion.\nClearly the attitude of disrespect that many executives have today for accurate reporting is a busines s\ndisgrace.  And auditors, as we have already suggested, have done little on the positive side.  Though auditor s\nshould regard the investing publi c as their client, they tend to kowtow instead to the managers who choose them\nand dole out their pay.  (“Whose bread I eat, his song I sing.”)\nA big piece of news, however, is tha t the SEC, led by its chairman, Arthur Levitt, seems determined to get\ncorporate America to clean up its act.  In a landmark speech  last September, Levitt called for an end to “earnings\nmanagement .”  He correctly observed, “Too many corporate managers, auditors and analysts are participants i n\na game of nods and winks.”  And then he laid on a real indictment: “Managing may be giving way t o\nmanipulating; integrity may be losing out to illusion.”\nI urge yo u to read the Chairman’s speech (you can find it on the Internet at www.sec.gov) and to support\nhim in his efforts to get corporate America to deliver a straight story to its owners.  Levitt’s job will b e\nHerculean, but it is hard to think of another more important for him to take on.\nReports to Shareholders\nBerkshire’s Internet site, www.berkshir ehathaway.com, has become a prime source for information about the\ncompany.  While we continue to send an annual report to all shareholders, we now send quarterlies only to those\nwho request them, letting others read these at our site.  In this report, we again enclose a card that can b e\nreturned by those wanting to get printed quarterlies in 1999.\nCharlie and I have two simple goals in reporting: 1) We want to give you the information that we would\nwish you to give us if our positions were reversed; and 2) We want to make Berkshire’s information accessible\nto all of you simultaneously.  Our ability to reach that second goal is greatly helped by the Internet.\nIn another portion of his September speech, Arthur Levitt deplored what he called “selective disclosure. ”\nHis remarks were timely:  Today, many companies matter-of-factly favor Wall Street analysts and institutional\n\n17investors in a variety of ways that often skirt or cross the line of unfairness.  These practices leave the great bulk\nof shareholders at a distinct disadvantage to a favored class.\nAt Berkshire, we regard the holder of one share of B stock as the equal of our large institutional investors.\nWe, of course, warmly welcome institutions as owners and have gained a number of them through the General\nRe merger.  We hope also that these new holders find that our owner’s manual and annual reports offer them\nmore insights and information about Berkshire than t hey garner about other companies from the investor relations\ndepartme nts that these corporations typically maintain.  But if it is “earnings guidance” or the like tha t\nshareholders or analysts seek, we will simply guide them to our public documents.\nThis year we plan to post our quarterly reports on the Internet after the close of the market on May 14 ,\nAugust 13, and November 12.  We also expe ct to put the 1999 annual report on our website on Saturday, March\n11, 2000, and to mail the print version at roughly the same time.\nWe promptly  post press releases on our website.  This means that you do not need to rely on the versions\nof these reported by the media but can instead read the full text on your computer.\nDespite the pathetic technical skills of your Chairman, I’m delighted to report that GEICO, Borsheim’s ,\nSee’s, and The B uffalo News are now doing substantial business via the Internet.  We’ve also recently begun to\noffer annuity products on our website.  This business was developed by Ajit Jain, who over the last decade has\npersonally accounted for  a significant portion of Berkshire’s operating earnings.  While Charlie and I sleep, Ajit\nkeeps thinking of new ways to add value to Berkshire.\nShareholder-Designated Contributions\nAbout 97.5% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshire's 1998 shareholder-designated contribution s\nprogram, with contributions totaling $16.9 million.  A full description of the program appears on pages 54-55.\nCumulatively, over the 18 years of t he program, Berkshire has made contributions of $130 million pursuant\nto the instructions of our shareholders.  The rest of Berkshire's giving is done by our subsidiaries, which stick\nto the philanthropic patterns that preva iled before they were acquired (except that their former owners themselves\ntake on the responsibility for their per sonal charities).  In aggregate, our subsidiaries made contributions of $12.5\nmillion in 1998, including in-kind donations of $2.0 million.\nTo participate in future programs, you must own Class A shares th at are registered in the name of the actual\nowner, not the nominee name of a broker, bank or deposit ory.  Shares not so registered on August 31, 1999, will\nbe ineligible for the 1999 program.  When you get the contributions form from us, return it promptly so that it\ndoes not get put aside or forgotten.  Designations received after the due date will not be honored.  \nThe Annual Meeting\nThis year’s Woodstock for Capitalists will be held May 1-3, and we may face a problem.  Last year more\nthan 10,000 people attended our an nual meeting, and our shareholders list has since doubled.  So we don’t quite\nknow what attendance to expect this year.  To be safe, we have booked both Aksarben Coliseum, which holds\nabout 14,000 and the Holiday Convention Centre, which  can seat an additional 5,000.  Because we know that our\nOmaha shareholders will want to be good hosts  to the out-of-towners (many of them come from outside the U.S),\nwe plan to give those visitors first crack at the Aksarben tickets and to subsequently allocate these to greate r\nOmaha residents on a first-come, first-served basis.  If w e exhaust the Aksarben tickets, we will begin distributing\nHoliday tickets to Omaha shareholders.\nIf we end up using both locations, Charlie and I will split our pre-meeting time between the two .\nAdditionally, we will have exhibits and also the Berkshire movie , large television screens and microphones at both\nsites.  When we break for lunch, many attendees will leave Aksarben, which means that those at Holiday can,\nif they wish, make the five-minute trip to Aksarben and finish out the day there.  Buses will be available t o\ntransport people who don’t have cars.\n\n18The doors will open at both locations at 7 a.m. on Monday , and at 8:30 we will premier the 1999 Berkshire\nmovie epic, produced by Marc  Hamburg, our CFO.  The meeting will last from 9:30 until 3:30, interrupted only\nby the short lunch break.\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed wit h this report explains how you can obtain the badge\nyou will need fo r admission to the meeting and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car reservations, we have\nagain signed up American Expre ss (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  In our normal fashion, we will run\nbuses from  the larger  hotels to the meeting.  After the meeting, these will make trips back to the hotels and to\nNebraska Furniture Mart, Borsheim’s and the airport.  Even so, you are likely to find a car useful.\nThe full l ine of Berkshire products will be available at Aksarben, and the more popular items will also be\nat Holiday.  Last year we set  sales records across-the-board, moving 3,700 pounds of See’s candy, 1,635 pairs of\nDexter sho es, 1,150 sets of Quikut knives and 3,104 Berkshire shirts and hats.  Additionally, $26,944 of World\nBook products were purchased as well as more than 2,000 golf balls with the Berkshire Hathaway logo.  Charlie\nand I are p leased but not satisfied with these numbers and confidently predict new records in all categories this\nyear.  Our 1999 apparel line will be unveiled at the meeting, so please defer your designer purchases until you\nview our collection.\nDairy Queen will also be on hand and will again donate all proceeds to the Children’s Miracle Network.\nLast  year w e sold about 4,000 Dilly  bars, fudge bars and vanilla/orange bars.  Additionally, GEICO will have®\na booth that will be manned by a number of our top counselors from around the country, all of them ready to\nsupply you with au to insurance quotes.  In almost all cases, GEICO will be able to offer you a specia l\nshareholder’s discount.  Check out whether we can save you some money.\nThe piece de resistance  of our one-company trade show will be a 79-foot-long, nearly 12-foot-wide, fully-\noutfitted cabin of a 737 Boeing Business Jet (“BBJ”), which i s NetJets’ newest product.  This plane has a 14-hour\nrange; is designe d to carry 19 passengers; and offers a bedroom, an office, and two showers.  Deliveries t o\nfractional owners will begin in the first quarter of 2000.\nThe BBJ w ill be available for your inspection on May 1-3 near the entrance to the Aksarben hall.  Yo u\nshould be able to minimize your wa it by making your visit on Saturday or Sunday.  Bring along your checkbook\nin case you decide to make an impulse purchase.\nNFM's multi-stored complex, located on a 75-acre site about a mile from Aksarben, is open from 10 a.m.\nto 9 p.m. on weekdays, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.  This operation did $300 million in\nbusiness during 1998 and offers an unriva led breadth of merchandise — furniture, electronics, appliances, carpets\nand computers — all at can’t-be-beat prices.  During the April 30th to May 4th period, shareholders presenting\ntheir meeting badge will receive a discount that is customarily given only to its employees.\nBorsheim's normally is closed on  Sunday but will be open for shareholders from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on May\n2nd.  On annual meeting weekend last year, the store did an incredible amount of business.  Sales were double\nthose of the previous year, and the sto re’s volume on Sunday greatly exceeded volume for any day in Borsheim’s\nhistory.  Charlie attributes this re cord to the fact that he autographed sales tickets that day and, while I have my\ndoubts about this proposition, we are not about to mess w ith a winning formula.  Please give him writer’s cramp.\nOn last year’s Sunday, Borsheim’s wrote 2,50 1 tickets during the eight hours it was open.  For those of you who\nare mathematically challenged, that is one ticket every 11½ seconds.\nShareholders  who wish to avoid Sunday’s crowd can visit Borsheim’s on Saturday (10 a.m.-5:30 p.m.) or\non Monday (10 a.m.-8 p.m.).  Be sure to identify yourself as a Berks hire owner so that Susan Jacques, Borsheim’s\nCEO, can quote you a ”shareholder-weekend” price.  Susan joined us in 1983 as a $4-per-hour salesperson and\nwas made CEO in 1994.  This move ranks as one of my best managerial decisions.\nBridge players can look forward to a thrill on Sunday, when Bob Hamman — the best the game has ever\nseen — will turn up to play with  our shareholders in the mall outside of Borsheim’s.  Bob plays without sorting\nhis cards — hey, maybe that’s what’s wrong with my game.  We will also have a couple of other tables at which\nanother expert or two will be playing.\n\n19Gorat’s — my favorite steakhouse — will again be open especia lly for Berkshire shareholders on the Sunday\nnight before the meeting.  Though Gorat’s served from 4 p.m. until about 1 a.m. last year, its crew was swamped,\nand some of our shareholders h ad an uncomfortable wait.  This year fewer reservations will be accepted, and we\nask that you don’t come on Sunday with out a reservation.  In other years, many of our shareholders have chosen\nto visit Gorat’s on Friday, Saturday or Monday.  You can make reserva tions beginning on April 1 (but not before)\nby calling 402-551-3733.  The cognoscenti will continue to or der rare T-bones with double orders of hash browns.\nThe Omaha Golden Spikes (neé the Omaha Royals) wi ll meet the Iowa Cubs on Saturday evening, May 1st,\nat Rosenblatt Stadium.  Your Chairman, whose breaking ball had the crowd buzzing last year, will again take\nthe mound.  This year I plan to introduce my “flutterball.”  It’s a real source of irritation to me that many view\nour annual meeting as a financial event rather than the sports classic I consider it to be.  Once the world sees\nmy flutterball, that misperception will be erased.\nOur proxy statement includes instructions about obtaining tickets to the game and also a large quantity of\nother information that should help you to enjoy your visit.  I particularly urge the 60,000 shareholders that we\ngained through the Gen Re merger to join us.  Come and meet your fellow capitalists.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIt wouldn’t  be right to close without a word about the 11.8 people who work with me in Berkshire’ s\ncorporate office.  In addition to handli ng the myriad of tax, regulatory and administrative matters that come with\nowning dozens of businesses, this group efficiently and che erfully manages various special projects, some of which\ngenerate hundreds of inquiries.  Here’s a sample of what went on in 1998:\n•6,106 shareholders designated 3,880 charities to receive contributions.\n•Kelly Muchemore processed about 17,500 admission tickets for the annual meeting, along wit h\norders and checks for 3,200 baseball tickets.\n•Kelly and Marc Hamburg produced and directed the Aksarben extravaganza, a job that required\nthem to arrange the presentations made by our subsidiaries, prepare our movie, and sometimes lend\npeople a hand with travel and lodging.\n•Debbie B osanek satisfied the varying needs of the 46 media organizations (13 of them non-U.S.)\nthat covered the meeting, and meanwhile, as always, skillfully assisted me in every aspect of my\njob.\n•Debbie and Marc assembled the data for our annual report and oversaw the production an d\ndistribution of 165,000 copies.  (This year the number will be 325,000.)\n•Marc handled 95% of the details — and mu ch of the substance — connected with our completing\ntwo major mergers.\n•Kelly, Debbi e and Deb Ray dealt efficiently with tens of thousands of requests for annual reports\nand financial information that came through the office.\nYou and I are p aying for only 11.8 people, but we are getting what would at most places be the output of\n100.  To all of the 11.8, my thanks.\nWarren E. Buffett\nMarch 1, 1999 Chairman of the Board",

The B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30th that of the A.\n3BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOur gain in net worth during 1999 was $358 million, which increased the per-share book value of both our\nClass A and Class B stock by 0.5%.  Over the last 35 years (that is, since present management took over) per-share\nbook value has grown from $19 to $37,987, a rate of 24.0% compounded annually.*\nThe numbe rs on the facing page show just how poor our 1999 record was.  We had the worst absolut e\nperformance of my tenure and, compared to the S&P, the worst relative performance as well.  Relative results are what\nconcern us: Over time, bad relative numbers will produce unsatisfactory absolute results.\nEven Inspector Clouseau could find  last year’s guilty party: your Chairman.  My performance reminds me of\nthe quarterback whose  report card showed four Fs and a D but who nonetheless had an understanding coach.  “Son,”\nhe drawled, “I think you’re spending too much time on that one subject.”\nMy “one subject” is capital allocation, and my grade for 1999 most assuredly is a D.  What most hurt us during\nthe year was the inferior performance of Berkshire’s equity portfolio — and responsibility for that portfolio, leaving\naside the small piec e of it run by Lou Simpson of GEICO, is entirely mine.  Several of our largest investees badl y\nlagged the market in 1999 because t hey’ve had disappointing operating results.  We still like these businesses and are\ncontent to have major investments in them.  But their stumbles damaged our performance last year, and it’s no sure\nthing that they will quickly regain their stride.\nThe fallout from our weak results in 1999 was a more-than-commensurate drop in our stock price.  In  1998,\nto go back a bit,  the stock outperformed the business.  Last year the business did much better than the stock, a\ndivergence that has continued to the date of this letter.  Over ti me, of course, the performance of the stock must roughly\nmatch the performance of the business.\nDespite our poor showing last year, Charlie Munger, Berkshire’s  Vice Chairman and my partner, and I expect\nthat the gain in Berkshire’s intrinsic  value over the next decade will modestly exceed the gain from owning  the S&P.\nWe can’t guaran tee that, of course.  But we are willing to back our conviction with our own money.  To repeat a fact\nyou’ve heard before, well over 99% of my net worth reside s in Berkshire.  Neither my wife nor I have ever sold a share\nof Berkshire and — unless our checks stop clearing — we have no intention of doing so.\nPlease note  that I spoke of hoping to beat the S&P “modestly.”  For Berkshire, truly large superiorities over\nthat index are a th ing of the past.  They existed then because we could buy both businesses and stocks at far mor e\nattractive prices than we can  now, and also because we then had a much smaller capital base, a situation that allowed\nus to consider a much wider range of investment opportunities than are available to us today.\nOur optimism about Berkshire’s performance is also tempered by the expectation — indeed, in our minds,\nthe virtual certainty — that the S&P will do far less well in the next decade or two than it has done since 1982.  A\nrecent article in Fortune expressed my views as to why this is inevitable, and I’m enclosing a copy with this report.\nOur goal is to r un our present businesses well — a task made easy  because of the outstanding managers we\nhave in place — and to acquire additional businesses having economic characteristics and managers comparable to\nthose we already ow n.  We made important progress in this respect during 1999 by acquiring Jordan’s Furniture and\ncontrac ting to buy a major portion of MidAmerican Energy.  We will talk more about these companies later in th e\nreport but let me emphasize one point here: We bought both for cash, issuing no Berkshire shares.  Deals of that kind\naren’t always possible, but that is the method of acquisition that Charlie and I vastly prefer.\n\n4Guides to Intrinsic Value\nI often talk in these pages about intrinsic value, a key, though far from precise, measurement we utilize in our\nacquisitions  of businesses and common stocks.  (For an extensive discussion of this, and other investment an d\naccounting terms and concepts, please refer to our Owner’s Manual on pages 55 - 62.  Intrinsic value is discussed on\npage 60.)\nIn our las t four reports, we have furnished you a table that we regard as useful in estimating Berkshire’ s\nintrinsic va lue.  In the updated version of that table, which follows, we trace two key components of value.  The first\ncolumn lists our per-share  ownership of investments (including cash and equivalents but excluding assets held in our\nfinancial  products operation) and the second column shows our per-share earnings from Berkshire’s operatin g\nbusinesses before taxes and purchase-accounting adjustments (discussed o n page 61), but after all interest and corporate\nexpenses.  The second column excludes all dividends, interest and capital gains that we realized from the investments\npresented in the first column.  In effect, the columns show how Berkshire would look if it were split into two parts, with\none entity holding our investments and the other operating all of our businesses and bearing all corporate costs.\nPre-tax Earnings\n           (Loss) Per Share\nInvestments With All Income from\nYear Per Share Investments Excluded\n1969............................................ $      45 $      4.39    \n1979............................................       577     13.07  \n1989............................................    7,200 108.86\n1999............................................       47,339                   (458.55)\nHere are the growth rates of the two segments by decade:\nPre-tax Earnings Per Share\nInvestments With All Income from\nDecade Ending Per Share Investments Excluded\n1979...........................................     29.0% 11.5%\n1989...........................................     28.7% 23.6%\n1999...........................................     20.7%     N.A.\nAnnual Growth Rate, 1969-1999 ......................     25.4%     N.A.\nIn 1999, our per-share investments changed very little, but our operating earnings, affected by negatives tha t\noverwhelmed  some strong positives, fell apart.  Most of our operating managers deserve a grade of A for delivering\nfine results and for having widened the difference between the intr insic value of their businesses and the value at which\nthese are carri ed on our balance sheet.  But, offsetting this, we had a huge — and, I believe, aberrational —\nunderwr iting loss at General Re.  Additionally, GEICO’s underwriting profit fell, as we had predicted it would .\nGEICO’s overall performance, though, was terrific, outstripping my ambitious goals.\nWe do not expect our underwriting earnings to improve in any dramatic way this year.  Though GEICO’ s\nintrinsic value sho uld grow by a highly satisfying amount, its underwriting performance is almost certain to weaken.\nThat’s because auto insurers, as a group, will do worse  in 2000, and because we will materially increase our marketing\nexpenditures.   At General Re, we are raising rates and, if there is no mega-catastrophe in 2000, the company’ s\nunderwriting loss should fall cons iderably.  It takes some time, however, for the full effect of rate increases to kick in,\nand General Re is therefore likely to have another unsatisfactory underwriting year.\n\n5You should be awa re that one item regularly working to widen the amount by which intrinsic value exceeds book\nvalue is the ann ual charge against income we take for amortization of goodwill — an amount now running about $500\nmillion.   This charge reduces the amount of goodwill we show as an asset and likewise the amount that is included in\nour book value.  This is an accounting matter having nothing t o do with true economic goodwill, which increases in most\nyears.  But even if economic goodwill were to  remain constant, the annual amortization charge would persistently widen\nthe gap between intrinsic value and book value.\nThough we ca n’t give you a precise figure for Berkshire’s intrinsic value, or even an approximation, Charlie and\nI can assure you that it far exceeds our $57.8 billion book value.  Businesses such as See’s and Buffalo News are now\nworth fifteen to twenty times the value at which they are carried on our books.  Our goal is to continually widen thi s\nspread at all subsidiaries.\nA Managerial Story You Will Never Read Elsewhere\nBerkshire’s collection of manag ers is unusual in several important ways.  As one example, a very high percentage\nof these m en and women are independently wealthy, having made fortunes in the businesses that they run.  They work\nneither because they need the money nor because they are contractuall y obligated to — we have no contracts at Berkshire.\nRather, they work long and hard because they love their businesses.  And I use the word “their” advisedly, since these\nmanagers  are tru ly in charge — there are no show-and-tell presentations in Omaha, no budgets to be approved b y\nheadquarters, no dictums issued about capital expenditures.  We simply ask our managers to run their companies as if\nthese are the sole asset of their families and will remain so for the next century.\nCharlie and I try to behave with our mana gers just as we attempt to behave with Berkshire’s shareholders, treating\nboth groups as we would wish to be treated if our positions were reversed.  Though “working” means nothing to m e\nfinancially, I love doing it at Berkshire for some simple reasons: It gives me a sense of achievement, a freedom to act as\nI see fit and an opportunity to interact daily with people I like and trust.  Why should our managers —  accomplished\nartists at what they do — see things differently?\nIn their relations with Berkshire, our managers often appear to be hewing to President Kennedy’s charge, “Ask\nnot what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.”  Here’s a remarkable story from last year:\nIt’s about R. C. Willey, Utah’s  dominant home furnishing business, which Berkshire purchased from Bill Child and his\nfamily in 1995.  Bill and most of his managers are Mormons, and for this reason R. C. Willey’s stores have neve r\noperated  on Sunday.  This is a difficult way to do business:  Sunday is the favorite shopping day for many customers.\nBill, nonetheless, stuck to his  principles -- and while doing so built his business from $250,000 of annual sales in 1954,\nwhen he took over, to $342 million in 1999.\nBill felt that R. C. Willey could operate successfully i n markets outside of Utah and in 1997 suggested that we open\na store in Boise.  I was highly skeptical about taking a no-Sunday policy into a new territory where we would be u p\nagainst  entrenched rivals open seven days a week.  Nevertheless, this was Bill’s business to run.  So,  despite m y\nreservations, I told him to follow both his business judgment and his religious convictions.\nBill then insisted on a truly extrao rdinary proposition: He would personally buy the land and build the store — for\nabout $9 million as it turned out — and would sell it to us at his cost if it proved to be successful.  On the other hand,\nif sales fell short of his expectations, we could exit the business without p aying Bill a cent. This outcome, of course, would\nleave him with a huge  investment in an empty building.  I told him that I appreciated his offer but felt that if Berkshire\nwas going to get the upside it should also take the downside.  Bill said nothing doing: If there was to be failure because\nof his religious beliefs, he wanted to take the blow personally.\nThe store opened last August and immediately became a huge success.  Bill thereupon turned the property ove r\nto us — including some extra land that had  appreciated significantly — and we wrote him a check for his cost.  And get\nthis:  Bill refused to take a dime of interest on the capital he had tied up over the two years .\n\n6If a manager has behaved similarly at some other p ublic corporation, I haven’t heard about it.  You can understand\nwhy the opportunity to partner with people like Bill Child causes me to tap dance to work every morning.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nA footnote: After our “soft” opening in August, we had a grand opening of the Boise store about a month later .\nNaturally, I went there to cut the ribbon (your Chairman, I wish to emphasize, is good for something ).  In my talk I told\nthe crowd how sal es had far exceeded expectations, making us, by a considerable margin, the largest home furnishings\nstore in Idaho.  Then, as the speech progressed, my memory miraculously began to improve.  By the end of my talk, it\nall had come back to me: Opening a store in Boise had been my idea.\nThe Economics of Property/Casualty Insurance\nOur main bu siness — though we have others of great importance — is insurance.  To understand Berkshire ,\ntherefore, it is necessary that you understand how to evaluate an insurance company.  The key determinants are: (1) the\namount of float that the business generates; (2) its cost; and (3) mos t critical of all, the long-term outlook for both of these\nfactors.\nTo begin with, float is money we hold but d on't own.  In an insurance operation, float arises because premiums are\nreceived before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes exten ds over many years.  During that time, the insurer invests\nthe money.  This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside:  The premiums that an insurer takes in usually\ndo not cover the losses and expense s it eventually must pay.  That leaves it running an \"underwriting loss,\" which is the\ncost of float.  An in surance business has value if its cost of float over time is less than the cost the company woul d\notherwise incur to obtain funds.  But the business is a lemon if its cost of float is higher than market rates for money.\nA cautio n is appropriate here:  Because loss costs must be estimated, insurers have enormous latitude in figuring\ntheir underwriting results, and that makes it very difficult for investors to calculate a company's true cost of float.  Errors\nof estimation, usually innocent but sometimes no t, can be huge.  The consequences of these miscalculations flow directly\ninto earnin gs.  An experienced observer can usually detect large-scale errors in reserving, but the general public ca n\ntypically do no more than accept what's presented, and at times I have been amazed by the numbers that big-nam e\nauditors have  implicitly blessed.  In 1999 a number of insurers announced reserve adjustments that made a mockery of\nthe “earnings” that inves tors had relied on earlier when making their buy and sell decisions.  At Berkshire, we strive to\nbe conservative and consistent in our reserving.  Even so, we warn you that an unpleasant surprise is always possible.\nThe table that follows shows (at intervals) the float generated by the various segments of Berkshire’s insuranc e\noperations si nce we entered the business 33 years ago upon acquiring National Indemnity Company (whose traditional\nlines are included in the segm ent “Other Primary”).  For the table we have calculated our float — which we generate in\nlarge amounts relative to our premium volume — by  adding net loss reserves, loss adjustment reserves, funds held under\nreinsurance assumed and unearned premium reserves, and then subtracting agents balances, prepaid acquisition costs,\nprepaid taxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance.  (Got that?)\nYearend Float (in $ millions)\nYear GEICO General Re Reinsurance Primary TotalOther Other\n1967 20       20\n1977 40 131     171\n1987 701 807  1,508\n1997 2,917 4,014   455  7,386\n1998 3,125 14,909 4,305   415 22,754\n1999 3,444 15,166 6,285  403 25,298\nGrowth of float is important — but its cost is what’s vital.  Over the years we have usually recorded only a small\nunderwriting  loss — which means our cost of float was correspondingly low — or actually had an underwriting profit,\n\n7which means we were being paid for hold ing other people’s money.  Indeed, our cumulative result through 1998 was an\nunderwriting profit.  I n 1999, however, we incurred a $1.4 billion underwriting loss that left us with float cost of 5.8%.\nOne mildly mitigating factor: We enthusiasti cally welcomed $400 million of the loss because it stems from business that\nwill deliver us exceptional float over the next decade.  The balance of the loss, however, was decidedly unwelcome, and\nour overall result must be judged extremely poor.  Absent a mega-catastrophe, we expect float cost to fall in 2000, but\nany decline will be tempered by our aggressive plans for GEICO, which we will discuss later.\nThere are a number of people who deserve credit for manufacturing so much “no-cost” float over the years .\nForemo st is Ajit Jain.  It’s simply impossible to overstate Ajit’s value to Berkshire: He has from scratch built a n\noutstanding reinsurance business, whic h during his tenure has earned an underwriting profit and now holds $6.3 billion\nof float.\nIn Ajit, we have an underwriter equipped with the intelligence to properly rate most risks; the realism to forge t\nabout those he can’t evaluate;  the courage to write huge policies when the premium is appropriate; and the discipline to\nreject even the smallest risk when the premium is inadequate.  It is rare to find a person possessing any one of thes e\ntalents.  For one person to have them all is remarkable.\nSince Ajit specializes in super-cat rein surance, a line in which losses are infrequent but extremely large when they\noccur, his business is sure to be far more volatile  than most insurance operations.  To date, we have benefitted from good\nluck on this volatile book.  Even so, Ajit’s achievements are truly extraordinary.\nIn a smaller but nevertheless important way, our “other  primary” insurance operation has also added to Berkshire’s\nintrinsic value.  This collection of insurers has delivered  a $192 million underwriting profit over the past five years while\nsupplying us with the float shown in the tab le.  In the insurance world, results like this are uncommon, and for their feat\nwe thank Rod Eldred, Brad Kinstler, John Kizer, Don Towle and Don Wurster.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the General Re operation had an exceptionally poor underwriting year in 1999 (thoug h\ninvestment income left the company we ll in the black).  Our business was extremely underpriced, both domestically and\ninternationally,  a condition that is improving but not yet corrected.  Over time, however, the company should develop\na growing amount of low-cost float.  At both General Re and its Cologne subsidiary, incentive compensation plans are\nnow directly tied to the variables of float growth and cost of float, the same variables that determine value for owners.\nEven though a reinsurer may have a tightly focused and rational compensation system, it cannot count on every\nyear coming up roses.  Reinsurance is a highly volatile business, and neither General Re nor Ajit’s operation is immune\nto bad pricing behavior in the industry.  But General Re has the distribution , the underwriting skills, the culture, and\n— with Berkshire’s backing — the fina ncial clout to become the world’s most profitable reinsurance company.  Getting\nthere will take time, energy and discipline, but we have no doubt that Ron Ferguson and his crew can make it happen.\nGEICO (1-800-847-7536 or GEICO.com)\nGEICO  made exceptional progress in 1999.  The reasons are simple: We have a terrific business idea bein g\nimplemented by an extraordi nary manager, Tony Nicely.  When Berkshire purchased GEICO at the beginning of 1996,\nwe handed the keys to Tony and asked him to  run the operation exactly as if he owned 100% of it.  He has done the rest.\nTake a look at his scorecard:\nNew Auto Auto Policies\nYears       Policies        In-Force(1)(2) (1)\n1993   346,882 2,011,055\n1994   384,217 2,147,549\n1995   443,539 2,310,037\n1996   592,300 2,543,699\n1997   868,430 2,949,439\n1998 1,249,875 3,562,644\n1999 1,648,095 4,328,900\n “Voluntary” only; excludes assigned risks and the like.(1) \n Revised to exclude policies moved from one GEICO company to another.(2)\n\n8In 1995, GEICO spent $33 million on marketing and had 652 telephone counselors.  Last year the company spent\n$242 million, and the counselor count grew to 2,631.  And we are just s tarting: The pace will step up materially in 2000.\nIndeed, we would happily  commit $1 billion annually to marketing if we knew we could handle the business smoothly\nand if we expected the last dollar spent to produce new business at an attractive cost.\nCurrently two trends are affecting acquisition costs.  The bad news is that it has become more expensive to develop\ninquiries.  Media rates have risen, and we are also seeing diminishing returns — that is, as both we and our competitors\nstep up advertising, inquiries per ad fall for all of us.  These negatives are partly offset, however, by the fact that our\nclosure ratio — the percentage of inquiries converted to sales — has steadily improved.  Overall, we believe that our\ncost of new business, though definitely rising, is well below that of the industry.  Of even greater importance, ou r\noperating  costs for renewal business are the lowest among broad-based national auto insurers.  Both of these majo r\ncompetitive advantages are sustainable.  Others may copy  our model, but they will be unable to replicate our economics.\nThe table above makes it appear that GEICO’s retention of policyholders is falling, but for two reason s\nappearances are in th is case deceiving.  First, in the last few years our business mix has moved away from “preferred”\npolicyholders, for whom industrywide retention rates are high, toward “standard” and “non-standard” policyholders for\nwhom retention rates are much lower.  (Despite the nomenclature, the three classes have similar profit prospects. )\nSecond, retention rates for relatively new policyholders are always lower than those for long-time customers — an d\nbecause  of our accelerated growth, our policyholder ranks now include an increased proportion of new customers .\nAdjusted for these two factors, our retention rate has changed hardly at all.\nWe told you last year that underwriting margins for both GEICO and the industry would fall in 1999, and they\ndid.  We make a similar prediction for 2000.  A few years ago margins got too wide, having enjoyed the effects of an\nunusual and unexpected decrease in the frequency and severity of accidents.  The industry responded by reducing rates\n— but now is having to contend with an increase in loss costs.  We would not be surprised to see the margins of auto\ninsurers deteriorate by around three percentage points in 2000.\nTwo negatives besi des worsening frequency and severity will hurt the industry this year.  First, rate increases go\ninto effect only slowly, both because of regulatory delay and because insurance contracts must run their course before\nnew rates can be put in.  Second, reported earnings of many auto insurers have benefitted in the last few years fro m\nreserve releases, made possible because the companies overest imated their loss costs in still-earlier years.  This reservoir\nof redundant reserves has now largely dried up, and future boosts to earnings from this source will be minor at best. \nIn compensating its associates — from Tony on down — GEICO continues to use two variables, and only two,\nin determining what bonuses a nd profit-sharing contributions will be: 1) its percentage growth in policyholders and 2)\nthe earnings of its “seasoned” business, meaning policies that have been with us for more than a year.  We di d\noutstandingly well on both fronts during 1999 and therefore made a profit-sharing payment of 28.4% of salary (in total,\n$113.3 million) to the great majority of our associates.  Tony and I love writing those checks.\nAt Berkshire,  we want to have compensation policies that are both easy to understand and in sync with what we\nwish our associates to accomplish.  Writing new business is expensive (and, as mentioned, getting more expensive).\nIf we were to include  those costs in our calculation of bonuses — as managements did before our arrival at GEICO —\nwe would be penalizing our associates for garnering new policies, even though these are very much in Berkshire’ s\ninterest.  S o, in effect, we say to our associates that we will foot the bill for new business.  Indeed, because percentage\ngrowth in policyholders is part of our compensation scheme, we reward our associates for producing this initially -\nunprofitable business.  And then we  reward them additionally for holding down costs on our seasoned business.\nDespite the extensive advertising we do, our best s ource of new business is word-of-mouth recommendations from\nexisting  policyholders, who on the whole are pleased with our prices and service.  An article published last year b y\nKiplinger’s  Personal Finance  Magazine  gives a good picture of where we stand in customer satisfaction: Th e\nmagazine’s  survey of 20 state insurance departments showed that GEICO’s complaint ratio was well below the ratio\nfor most of its major competitors.\nOur strong referral busines s means that we probably could maintain our policy count by spending as little as $50\nmillion  annually on advertising.  That’s a guess, of course, and we will never know whether it is accurate becaus e\nTony’s foot is going to stay on the advertising pedal (and my foot will be on his).  Nevertheless, I want to emphasize\nthat a major percentage of the $300-$350 million we w ill spend in 2000 on advertising, as well as large additional costs\n\n9we will incur for sales counselors, communications and facilities, are optional outlays we choose to make so that we\ncan both achieve significant growth and extend and solidify the promise of  the GEICO brand in the minds of Americans.\nPersonally, I think these expenditures are the best investment Berkshire can make.  Through its advertising ,\nGEICO is acquiring a dire ct relationship with a huge number of households that, on average, will send us $1,100 year\nafter year.  That makes us — among all companies, selling whatever kind of product — one of the country’s leading\ndirect merchandisers.  Also, as we build our long-term relationships with more and more families, cash is pouring in\nrather than going out (no Internet economics here).  Last year, as GEICO increased its customer base by 766,256, it\ngained $590 million of cash from operating earnings and the increase in float.\nIn the past three years, we have increased our market share in personal auto insurance from 2.7% to 4.1%.  But\nwe rightfully belong in many  more households — maybe even yours.  Give us a call and find out.  About 40% of those\npeople checking our rates find that they can save money by doi ng business with us.  The proportion is not 100% because\ninsurers differ in their underwrit ing judgments, with some giving more credit than we do to drivers who live in certain\ngeographic areas or work at certain occupatio ns.  Our closure rate indicates, however, that we more frequently offer the\nlow price than does any other national carrier selling insurance to all comers.  Furthermore, in 40 states we can offer\na special disco unt — usually 8% — to our shareholders.  Just be sure to identify yourself as a Berkshire owner so that\nour sales counselor can make the appropriate adjustment.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIt’s with sadness t hat I report to you that Lorimer Davidson, GEICO’s former Chairman, died last November,  a\nfew days after his 97  birthday.  For GEICO,  Davy was a business giant who moved the company up to the big leagues.th\nFor me, he was a friend, teacher and hero.  I have told you of his lifelong kindnesses to me in past reports.  Clearly, my\nlife would have developed far differently had he not been a part of it.  Tony, Lou Simpson and I visited Davy in August\nand marve led at his mental alertness — particularly in all matters regarding GEICO.  He was the company’s number\none supporter right up to the end, and we will forever miss him.\nAviation Services\nOur two aviation services companies — FlightSafety International (“FSI”) and Executive Jet Aviation (“EJA”)\n— are both runaway leaders in their field.  EJA, which sells and manages the fractional ownership of jet aircraft ,\nthrough  its NetJet s® program, is larger than its next two competitors combined.  FSI trains pilots (as well as othe r\ntransportation professionals) and is five times or so the size of its nearest competitor.\nAnother commo n characteristic of the companies is that they are still managed by their founding entrepreneurs.\nAl Ueltschi started FSI in 1951 with $10,000, and Rich Santulli invented the fractional-ownership industry in 1986.\nThese men are both remarkable managers who have no financial need to work but thrive on helping their companies\ngrow and excel.\nThough  these two businesses have leadership positions that are similar, they differ in their economi c\ncharacteristics.  FSI must lay out huge amounts of capital.  A single flight simulator can cost as much as $15 million\n— and we have 222.  Only one person at a time, furthermore, can be trained  in a simulator, which means that the capital\ninvestment per dollar of revenue at FSI is e xceptionally high.  Operating margins must therefore also be high, if we are\nto earn a reasonable return on ca pital.  Last year we made capital expenditures of $215 million at FSI and FlightSafety\nBoeing, its 50%-owned affiliate.\nAt EJA, in contrast, the customer owns the equipment, though we , of course, must invest in a core fleet of our own\nplanes to ensure outstanding service.  For example, the Sunday after Th anksgiving, EJA’s busiest day of the year, strains\nour resources since fractions of 169 planes are owned by 1,412 customers, many of whom are bent on flying hom e\nbetween  3 and 6 p.m.  On that day, and certain others, we need a supply of company-owned aircraft to make sure all\nparties get where they want, when they want.\nStill, most of the planes we fly are owned by customers,  which means that modest pre-tax margins in this business\ncan produce good returns on equity.  Currently, our customers own planes w orth over $2 billion, and in addition we have\n$4.2 billion  of planes on order.  Indeed, the limiting factor in our business right now is the availability of planes.  We\n\n10now are taking delivery of about 8% of all business jets manufactured in the world, and we wish we could get a bigger\nshare than that.  Though EJA was supply-constrained in 1999, its recurring revenues — monthly management fees plus\nhourly flight fees — increased 46%.\nThe fractional-ownership industry is still in its infancy.  EJA is now building critical mass in Europe, and over\ntime we will expand around the world.  Doing that will be expensive — very expensive — but we will spend what it\ntakes.  Scale is vital to both u s and our customers: The company with the most planes in the air worldwide will be able\nto offer its customers the best service.  “Buy a fraction, get a fleet” has real meaning at EJA.\nEJA enjoys ano ther important advantage in that its two largest competitors are both subsidiaries of aircraf t\nmanufacturers and sell only the aircraft their parents make.  Though these are fine planes, these competitors are severely\nlimited in the cabin s tyles and mission capabilities they can offer.  EJA, in contrast, offers a wide array of planes from\nfive suppliers.  Consequently, we can give the customer whatever  he needs to buy — rather than his getting what the\ncompetitor’s parent needs to sell.\nLast year in this report, I described my family’s delight with the one-quarter (200 flight hours annually) of a\nHawker 1000 that we had owned since 1995.  I got so pumped up by my own prose that shortly thereafter I signed up\nfor one-sixteenth of a Cessna V Ultra as well.  Now my annual outlays at EJA and Borsheim’s, combined, total ten times\nmy salary.  Think of this as a rough guideline for your own expenditures with us. \nDuring the past year, two of Berkshire’s outside directors have also signed on with EJA.  (Maybe we’re paying\nthem too much.)  You should be aware that they and I are charged exactly the same price for planes and service as is\nany other customer: EJA follows a “most favored nations” policy, with no one getting a special deal.\nAnd now, brace yourself.  Last year, EJA passed the ultimate test: Charlie signed up.   No other endorsement could\nspeak more eloquently to the value o f the EJA service.  Give us a call at 1-800-848-6436 and ask for our “white paper”\non fractional ownership.\nAcquisitions of 1999\nAt both GEICO and Exe cutive Jet, our best source of new customers is the happy ones we already have.  Indeed,\nabout 65% of our new owners of aircraft come as referrals from current owners who have fallen in love with the service.\nOur acquisitions usually develop in the same way.  At other companies, executives may devote themselves t o\npursuing acquisit ion possibilities with investment bankers, utilizing an auction process that has become standardized.\nIn this exercise the bankers prepare a “book” that makes me think of the Superman comics of my youth.  In the Wall\nStreet version, a formerly mild-mannered company emerges fr om the investment banker’s phone booth able to leap over\ncompetitors  in a single bound and with earnings moving faster than a speeding bullet.  Titillated by the book’ s\ndescription  of the acquiree’s powers, acquisition-hungry CEOs — Lois Lanes all, beneath their cool exteriors —\npromptly swoon.\nWhat’s particularly entertaining i n these books is the precision with which earnings are projected for many years\nahead.  If you ask the author-banker, however, what his own firm will earn next month , he will go into a protectiv e\ncrouch and tell you that business and markets are far too uncertain for him to venture a forecast.\nHere’s one story I can’t resist relat ing: In 1985, a major investment banking house undertook to sell Scott Fetzer,\noffering  it wide ly — but with no success.  Upon reading of this strikeout, I wrote Ralph Schey, then and now Scot t\nFetzer’s CEO, expressin g an interest in buying the business.  I had never met Ralph, but within a week we had a deal.\nUnfortunately, Scott Fetzer’s l etter of engagement with the banking firm provided it a $2.5 million fee upon sale, even\nif it had nothing to do with finding the buyer.  I guess the lead banker felt he should do something for his payment, so\nhe graciously offered us a copy of the book on Scott  Fetzer that his firm had prepared.  With his customary tact, Charlie\nresponded: “I’ll pay $2.5 million not to read it.”\nAt Berkshire, our carefully-crafted acquisition strategy is simply to wait for the phone to ring.  Happily, i t\nsometimes does so,  usually because a manager who sold to us earlier has recommended to a friend that he think about\nfollowing suit.\n\n11Which brings us to the fur niture business.  Two years ago I recounted how the acquisition of Nebraska Furniture\nMart in 198 3 and my subsequent association with the Blumkin family led to follow-on transactions with R. C. Willey\n(1995) and Star Furniture (1997).  For me, these relationships have all been terrific.  Not only did Berkshire acquire\nthree outstandin g retailers; these deals also allowed me to become friends with some of the finest people you will ever\nmeet.\nNaturally,  I have persistently asked the Blumkins, Bill Child and Melvyn Wolff whether there are any more out\nthere like you.  Their invariable answer was the Tatelman brothers of New England and their remarkable furnitur e\nbusiness, Jordan’s.\nI met Barry and Eliot Tatelman last year and we soon signed an agreement for Berkshire to acquire the company.\nLike our three previous furniture acquisitions, this business had long been in the family — in this case since 1927, when\nBarry and Eliot’s grandfather began operations in a Boston suburb.  Under the brothers’ management, Jordan’s ha s\ngrown ever more dominant in its region, becoming the largest furniture retailer in New Hampshire as well a s\nMassachusetts.\nThe Tatelman s don’t just sell furniture or manage stores.  They also present customers with a dazzlin g\nentertainment  experience called “shoppertainment.”  A family visiting a store can have a terrific time, whil e\nconcurrently viewing an ex traordinary selection of merchandise.  The business results are also extraordinary: Jordan’s\nhas the highest sales per square foot of any major furniture operation in the country.  I urge you to visit one of thei r\nstores if you are in the Boston area — particularly the one at Natick, which is Jordan’s newest.  Bring money.\nBarry and Eliot are classy people — just like their counterparts at Berkshire’s three other furniture operations.\nWhen they sold to us, they elected to giv e each of their employees at least 50¢ for every hour that he or she had worked\nfor Jordan’s.  This payment added up to $9 million, which came from the Tate lmans’ own pockets, not from Berkshire’s.\nAnd Barry and Eliot were thrilled to write the checks.\nEach of our furniture operations is number one in its territory.  We now sell more furniture than anyone else in\nMassachusetts, New Hampshire, Texas, Nebraska, Utah and Idaho.  Last year St ar’s Melvyn Wolff and his sister, Shirley\nToomim, scored two major successes: a mo ve into San Antonio and a significant enlargement of Star’s store in Austin.\nThere’s no operation in the furniture retail ing business remotely like the one assembled by Berkshire.  It’s fun for\nme and profit able for you.  W. C. Fields once said, “It was a woman who drove me to drink, but unfortunately I never\nhad the chance to thank her.”  I don’t want to make that mistake.  My thanks go to Louie, Ron and Irv Blumkin for\ngetting me started in the furniture business and for unerringly guidin g me as we have assembled the group we now have.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nNow, for our second acqui sition deal: It came to us through my good friend, Walter Scott, Jr., chairman of Level\n3 Communications and  a director of Berkshire.  Walter has many other business connections as well, and one of them\nis with M idAmerican Energy, a utility company in which he has substantial holdings and on whose board he sits.  At\na conference in California that we bot h attended last September, Walter casually asked me whether Berkshire might be\ninterested in making a large investment in MidAmerican, and from the sta rt the idea of being in partnership with Walter\nstruck me as a good one.  Upon returning to Omaha, I read some of MidAmerican’s public reports and had two short\nmeetings  with Walter and David Sokol, MidAmerican’s talented and entrepreneurial CEO.  I then said that, at a n\nappropriate price, we would indeed like to make a deal.\nAcquisitions in the electric utility ind ustry are complicated by a variety of regulations including the Public Utility\nHolding Company Act of 1935.  Therefore, we had to structure a transaction that would avoid Berkshire gaining voting\ncontrol.   Instead we are purchasing an 11% fixed-income security, along with a combination of common stock an d\nexchangeable preferred that wil l give Berkshire just under 10% of the voting power of MidAmerican but about 76% of\nthe equity interest.  All told, our investment will be about $2 billion.\nWalter characteristically backed up his convictions with real money: He and his family will buy mor e\nMidAmerican stock for cash when the transaction closes, bringing their total investment to about $280 million.  Walter\nwill also be the controlling shareholder of the company, and I can’t think of a better person to hold that post.\nThough  there are many regulatory constraints in the utility industry, it’s possible that we will make additiona l\ncommitments in the field.  If we do, the amounts involved could be large.\n\n12Acquisition Accounting\nOnce again, I would like to make some comments about accounting, in this case about its application t o\nacquisitions.  This is currently a very contentious topic and, b efore the dust settles, Congress may even intervene (a truly\nterrible idea).\nWhen a company is acquired, generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) currently condone two ver y\ndifferent ways of recording the transaction: “purchase” and “pooling.”  In a pooling, stock must be the currency; in a\npurchase, payment can b e made in either cash or stock.  Whatever the currency, managements usually detest purchase\naccounting becaus e it almost always requires that a “goodwill” account be established and subsequently written off —\na process that saddles earnings with a large annual charge that normally p ersists for decades.  In contrast, pooling avoids\na goodwill account, which is why managements love it.\nNow, the Financial Accountin g Standards Board (“FASB”) has proposed an end to pooling, and many CEOs are\ngirding for battle.  It will be an important fight, so we’ll venture some opinions.  To begin with, we agree with the many\nmanagers who argue that goodwill amortization charge s are usually spurious.  You’ll find my thinking about this in the\nappendix to our 1983 annual report, which is available on our website, and in the Owner’s Manual on pages 55 - 62.\nFor accounting rules to mandate amortization that will, in the usual case, conflict with reality is deepl y\ntroublesome:   Most accounting charges relate to what’s going on, even if they don’t precisely measure it.  As a n\nexample, depreciation charges can’t with precision calibrate the decline in value that physical assets suffer, but these\ncharges do at least describ e something that is truly occurring: Physical assets invariably deteriorate.  Correspondingly,\nobsolescence charges for  inventories, bad debt charges for receivables and a ccruals for warranties are among the charges\nthat reflect true costs.  The annual charges for these expen ses can’t be exactly measured, but the necessity for estimating\nthem is obvious.\nIn contrast, economic goodwill does n ot, in many cases, diminish.  Indeed, in a great many instances —  perhaps\nmost —  it actually grows in value over time.  In character, economic goodwill is much like land: The value of both\nassets is sure to fluctuate, but  the direction in which value is going to go is in no way ordained.  At See’s, for example,\neconomic  goodwill has grown, in an irregular but very substantial manner, for 78 years.  And, if we run the business\nright, growth of that kind will probably continue for at least another 78 years. \nTo escape from the fiction of goodwill charges, managers embrace the fiction of pooling.  This accountin g\nconvention is grounded in the poetic notion th at when two rivers merge their streams become indistinguishable.  Under\nthis concept, a company that has been merged into a larger enterprise has not been “purchased” (even though it will\noften have received a large “sell-out” premium).  Consequently, no goodwill is created, and those pesky subsequen t\ncharges to earnings are eliminated.  Instead, the accounting for the ongoing entity is handled as if the businesses had\nforever been one unit.\nSo much for poetry.  The reality of merging is usually far different: There is indisputably an acquirer and a n\nacquiree, and the latter has been “purchased,” no matter how the deal has been structured.  If you think otherwise, just\nask employees severed from their job s which company was the conqueror and which was the conquered.  You will find\nno confusion.  S o on this point the FASB is correct: In most mergers, a purchase has been made.  Yes, there are some\ntrue “mergers of equals,” but they are few and far between.\nCharlie and I b elieve there’s a reality-based approach that should both satisfy the FASB, which correctly wishes\nto record a purchase , and meet the objections of managements to nonsensical charges for diminution of goodwill.  We\nwould first have the acquiring company record its purchase price — whether paid in stock or cash — at fair value.  In\nmost cases, this pr ocedure would create a large asset representing economic goodwill.  We would then leave this asset\non the books, not requiring its a mortization.  Later, if the economic goodwill became impaired, as it sometimes would,\nit would be written down just as would any other asset judged to be impaired.\nIf our proposed rule were to be adopted, it should be applied retroactively so that acquisition accounting would\nbe consistent through out America — a far cry from what exists today.  One prediction: If this plan were to take effect,\nmanagement s would structure acquisitions more sensibly, deciding whether to use cash or stock based on the rea l\nconsequences for their shareholders rather than on the unreal consequences for their reported earnings.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n13In our purchase of Jordan’s, we followed a procedure that will maximize the cash produced for our shareholders\nbut minimi ze the earnings we report to you.  Berkshire purchased assets for cash, an approach that on our tax returns\npermits us to amortize the resulting goodwil l over a 15-year period.  Obviously, this tax deduction  materially increases\nthe amount of cash delivered by the business.  In contrast, when stock, rather than assets, is purchased for cash, th e\nresulting  writeoffs of goodwill are not tax-deductible.  The economic difference between these two approaches i s\nsubstantial.\nFrom the economic standpoint of the acquiring company, the worst deal of all is a stock-for-stock acquisition .\nHere, a huge price is often paid withou t there being any step-up in the tax basis of either the stock of the acquiree or its\nassets.  If the acquired entity is subsequently sold, its ow ner may owe a large capital gains tax (at a 35% or greater rate),\neven though the sale may truly be producing a major economic loss.\nWe have made s ome deals at Berkshire that used far-from-optimal tax structures.  These deals occurred because\nthe sellers insisted on a given structure and because, overall, we still felt the acquisition made sense.  We have never\ndone an inefficiently-structured deal, however, in order to make our figures look better.\nSources of Reported Earnings\nThe table that follows shows the main sources of Berkshire's reported earnings.  In this presentation, purchase-\naccounting adjustments a re not assigned to the specific businesses to which they apply, but are instead aggregated and\nshown separately.  This procedure lets you view the earnings of our businesses as they would have been reported had\nwe not purchased them .  For the reasons discussed on page 61, this form of presentation seems to us to be more useful\nto investors and managers than one utilizing generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which require purchase-\npremiums to be charged off business-by-business.  The total earnings we show in the table are, of course, identical to\nthe GAAP total in our audited financial statements.\n(in millions)\nBerkshire’s Share\nof Net Earnings\n(after taxes and\nPre-Tax Earnings minority interests)\n1999 1998 1999 1998\nOperating Earnings:\n  Insurance Group:\n    Underwriting — Reinsurance ............... $(1,440) $(21) $(927) $(14)\n    Underwriting — GEICO ................... 24  269 16 175 \n    Underwriting — Other Primary .............. 22 17 14 10 \n    Net Investment Income .................... 2,482 974 1,764 731 \n  Buffalo News ............................. 55 53 34 32 \n  Finance and Financial Products Businesses ...... 125 205 86 133 \n  Flight Services ............................ 225 181 132 110 (1) (1)\n  Home Furnishings ......................... 79 72 46 41 (2) (2)\n  International Dairy Queen ................... 56 58 35 35 \n  Jewelry ................................. 51 39 31 23 \n  Scott Fetzer (excluding finance operation) ....... 147 137 92 85 \n  See’s Candies ............................ 74 62 46 40 \n  Shoe Group .............................. 17 33 11 23 \n  Purchase-Accounting Adjustments ............

The exception\nwas Dexter Shoe, a nd there the shortfall did not occur because of managerial problems: In skills, energy and devotion\nto their work, the Dexter executives are every  bit the equal of our other managers.  But we manufacture shoes primarily\nin the U.S., and it has become extremely difficult for domestic  producers to compete effectively.  In 1999, approximately\n93% of the 1.3 billion pairs of shoes purchased in this country came from abroad, where extremely low-cost labor is the\nrule.\nCounting both Dexter and H. H. Brown, w e are currently the leading domestic manufacturer of shoes, and we are\nlikely to continue to be.  We have loyal, highly-skilled workers in our U.S. plants, and we want to retain every job here\nthat we can.  Nevertheless, in order to remain via ble, we are sourcing more of our output internationally.  In doing that,\nwe have incurred significant severance and relocation costs that are included in the earnings we show in the table.\nA few years back, Helzberg’s, our 200-store jewelry operation, needed to make operating adjustments to restore\nmargins to appropriate levels.  Under Jeff Comment’s leadership, the job was done and profits have dramaticall y\nrebounded.  In the shoe business, where we have Harold Alfond, Peter Lunder, Frank Rooney and Jim Issler in charge,\nI believe we will see a similar improvement over the next few years.\nSee’s Candies deserves a special comment, given that it achieved a record operating margin of 24% last year .\nSince we bought See’s for $25 million in 1972, it has earned $857 mi llion pre-tax.  And, despite its growth, the business\nhas required very little additional capital.  Give the credit for this performance to Chuck Huggins.  Charlie and I put\nhim in charge  the day of our purchase, and his fanatical insistence on both product quality and friendly service ha s\nrewarded customers, employees and owners.\nChuck gets better every year.  When he took charge of See’s at age 46, the company’s pre-tax profit, expressed\nin millions, was about 10% of his age.  Today he’s 74, and the ratio has increased to 100%.  Having discovered this\nmathematical  relationship — let’s call it Huggins’ Law — Charlie and I now become giddy at the mere thought o f\nChuck’s birthday.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAddition al information about our various businesses is given on pages 39 - 54, where you will also find ou r\nsegment earn ings reported on a GAAP basis.  In addition, on pages 63 - 69, we have rearranged Berkshire's financial\ndata into four segments on a non-GAAP b asis, a presentation that corresponds to the way Charlie and I think about the\ncompany.\nLook-Through Earnings\nReported  earnings are an inadequate measure of economic progress at Berkshire, in part because the number s\nshown in the table presented earlier include only the dividends we receive from investees — though these dividends\ntypically represent only a small fraction of the earnings attributable to our ownership.  Not that we mind this division\nof money, since on balance we regard the undistributed earnings of investees as more valuable to us than the portion\npaid out.  The reason f or our thinking is simple:  Our investees often have the opportunity to reinvest earnings at high\nrates of return.  So why should we want them paid out?\nTo depict something closer to economic reality at Berkshire than reported  earnings, though, we employ the concept\nof \"look-through\" e arnings.  As we calculate these, they consist of: (1) the operating earnings reported in the previous\nsection, plus; (2) our share of th e retained operating earnings of major investees that, under GAAP accounting, are not\nreflected i n our profits, less; (3) an allowance for the tax that would be paid by Berkshire if these retained earnings of\ninvestees had instead been distributed to us.  When tabulating \"operating earnings\" here, we exclude purchase -\naccounting adjustments as well as capital gains and other major non-recurring items.\nThe following table sets forth our 1999 look-through earnings, though I warn you that the figures can be no more\nthan approximate, since they are based on a number of judgment calls.  (Th e dividends paid to us by these investees have\nbeen included in the operating earnings itemized on page 13, mostly under \"I nsurance Group:  Net Investment Income.\")\n\n15Berkshire's Approximate Berkshire's Share of Undistributed\nBerkshire's Major Investees  Ownership at Yearend  Operating Earnings (in millions)(1)     (2)\nAmerican Express Company .............. 11.3% $228\nThe Coca-Cola Company .................    8.1%   144\nFreddie Mac ..........................   8.6%   127\nThe Gillette Company ...................   9.0%     53\nM&T Bank ...........................   6.5%     17\nThe Washington Post Company ............ 18.3%     30 \nWells Fargo & Company .................   3.6%   108  \nBerkshire's share of undistributed earnings of major investees 707  \nHypothetical tax on these undistributed investee earnings (99)  (3)  \nReported operating earnings of Berkshire     1,318  \n      Total look-through earnings of Berkshire $ 1,926  \n     (1) Does not include shares allocable to minority interests\n     (2) Calculated on average ownership for the year\n     (3) The tax rate used is 14%, which is the rate Berkshire pays on the dividends it receives\nInvestments\nBelow w e present our common stock investments.

As I mentioned  earlier, several of the companies in which we have large\ninvestments  had disappointing business results last year.  Nevertheless, we believe these companies have importan t\ncompetitive advantages that will end ure over time.  This attribute, which makes for good long-term investment results,\nis one Charlie and I occasionally believe we can identify.  More often, however, we can’t — not at least with a high\ndegree of conviction.  This explains, by the way,  why we don’t own stocks of tech companies, even though we share the\ngeneral view that our society will be transformed by their products and services.  Our problem — which we can’t solve\nby studying up — is that we have no insights into which participants in the tech field possess a truly durable  competitive\nadvantage.\nOur lack of tech insights , we should add, does not distress us.  After all, there are a great many business areas in\nwhich Charlie and I have no special capital-allocation expertise.  For instance, we bring nothing to the table when it\ncomes to evaluatin g patents, manufacturing processes or geological prospects.  So we simply don’t get into judgments\nin those fields.\n\n16If we have a stren gth, it is in recognizing when we are operating well within our circle of competence and when\nwe are approaching the perimeter.  Predicting the long-term economics of companies that operate in fast-changin g\nindustries is simply far beyond our perimeter.  If others claim predictive skill in those industries — and seem to have\ntheir claims validated by  the behavior of the stock market — we neither envy nor emulate them.  Instead, we just stick\nwith what w e understand.  If we stray, we will have done so inadvertently, not because we got restless and substituted\nhope for rationality.  Fortunately, it’s almost certain there will be opportunities from time to time for Berkshire to do\nwell within the circle we’ve staked out.\nRight now, the prices of the fine businesses we already own are just not that attractive.  In other words, we feel\nmuch better about the businesses than their stocks.  That’s why  we haven’t added to our present holdings.  Nevertheless,\nwe haven’t yet scaled back our portfolio in a major way:  If the choice is between a questionable business at a\ncomfortable  price or a comfortable business at a questionable price, we much prefer the latter.  What really gets ou r\nattention, however, is a comfortable business at a comfortable price.\nOur reservations about the prices of securities we own apply also to the general level of equity prices.  We have\nnever attempted to forecast what the stock market is going to do in the next month or the next year, and we are no t\ntrying to do that now.  But, as I point out in the enclosed article, equity investors currently seem wildly optimistic in\ntheir expectations about future returns.\nWe see the growth in corporate profits as being l argely tied to the business done in the country (GDP), and we see\nGDP growing at a real rate of about 3%.  In addition, we have hypothesized 2% inflation.  Charlie and I have n o\nparticular conviction about the accuracy of 2%.  However, it’s the market’s  view:  Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities\n(TIPS) yield about two percentage points less than the standard treasury bo nd, and if you believe inflation rates are going\nto be higher than that, you can profit by simply buying TIPS and shorting Governments.\nIf profits do indeed grow along with GDP, at about a 5% rate, the valuation placed on American business i s\nunlikely to climb by much more than that .  Add in something for dividends, and you emerge with returns from equities\nthat are dramatically less than most investors have either experienced in the past or expect in the future.  If investor\nexpectations  become more realistic — and they almost certainly will — the market adjustment is apt to be severe ,\nparticularly in sectors in which speculation has been concentrated.\nBerkshire will someday have opportunities to deploy m ajor amounts of cash in equity markets — we are confident\nof that.  But, as the song goes, “Who knows where or when?”  Meanwhile, if anyone starts explaining to you what is\ngoing on in the truly-manic portions of t his “enchanted” market, you might remember still another line of song: “Fools\ngive you reasons, wise men never try.”\nShare Repurchases\nRecently, a number of shareholders have suggested to us that Berk shire repurchase its shares.  Usually the requests\nwere rationally based, but a few leaned on spurious logic.\nThere is only one combination of facts that makes it advisable for a company to repurchase its shares: First, the\ncompan y has available funds — cash plus sensible borrowing capacity — beyond the near-term needs of the business\nand, second, finds its stock selling in the market below its intrinsic value, conservatively-calculated.  To this we add\na caveat: Shareholders should have been supplied all the information they need for estimating that value.  Otherwise,\ninsiders could take advantage of their uninformed partners and buy out their interests at a fraction of true worth.  We\nhave, on rare occasions, seen that happen.  Usually, of  course, chicanery is employed to drive stock prices up, not down.\nThe business “needs” that I s peak of are of two kinds: First, expenditures that a company must make to maintain\nits comp etitive position (e.g., the remodeling of stores at Helzberg’s) and, second, optional outlays, aimed at business\ngrowth,  that ma nagement expects will produce more than a dollar of value for each dollar spent (R. C. Willey’ s\nexpansion into Idaho).\nWhen available funds exceed needs of those k inds, a company with a growth-oriented shareholder population can\nbuy new businesses or repurchase shares.  If a company’s  stock is selling well below intrinsic value, repurchases usually\nmake the most sense.  In the mid-1970s, the  wisdom of making these was virtually screaming at managements, but few\nresponded.  In most cases, those that did made their owners much wealthier th an if alternative courses of action had been\n\n17pursued.  Indeed, during the 1970s (and, spasmodical ly, for some years thereafter) we searched for companies that were\nlarge repurc hasers of their shares.  This often was a tipoff that the company was both undervalued and run by a\nshareholder-oriented management.\nThat day is past.  Now, repurchases are all the rage, but are all too often made for an unstated and, in our view,\nignoble reason: to pump o r support the stock price.  The shareholder who chooses to sell today, of course, is benefitted\nby any buyer, whatever his origin or motives.  But the continuing  shareholder is penalized by repurchases above intrinsic\nvalue.  Buying dollar bills for $1.10 is not good business for those who stick around.\nCharlie and I admit that we feel confident in estimating intrinsic value for only a portion of traded equities and\nthen only when we employ a range of values, rather than some  pseudo-precise figure.  Nevertheless, it appears to us that\nmany companies now making  repurchases are overpaying departing shareholders at the expense of those who stay.  In\ndefense of those companies, I would say that it is natural for CEOs to be optimistic about their own businesses.  They\nalso know a whole lot more about  them than I do.  However, I can’t help but feel that too often today’s repurchases are\ndictated  by management’s desire to “show confidence” or be in fashion rather than by a desire to enhance per-shar e\nvalue.\nSometimes, too, companies say they are repurchasing shares t o offset the shares issued when stock options granted\nat much lower prices are exercised.  This “buy high, sell lo w” strategy is one many unfortunate investors have employed\n— but never intentionally!  Managements, however, seem to follow this perverse activity very cheerfully.\nOf course , both option grants and repurchases may make sense — but if that’s the case, it’s not because the two\nactivities are logically rela ted.  Rationally, a company’s decision to repurchase shares or to issue them should stand on\nits own feet.  Just because stock has been issued to satisf y options — or for any other reason — does not mean that stock\nshould be repurchased at a price above intrinsic value.  Correspondingly, a stock that sells well below intrinsic value\nshould be repurchased whether or not stock has previously been issued (or may be because of outstanding options).\nYou shou ld be aware that, at certain times in the past, I have erred in not making repurchases.  My appraisal of\nBerkshire’s  value was then too conservative or I was too enthused about some alternative use of funds.  We hav e\ntherefore missed some opportunities — though Berkshire’s trading volume at these points was too light for us to have\ndone much buying, which means that the gain  in our per-share value would have been minimal.  (A repurchase of, say,\n2% of a company’s shares at a 25% discount from per-share intrinsic value produces only a ½% gain in that value at\nmost — and even less if the funds could alternatively have been deployed in value-building moves.)\nSome of the letters we’ve received clearly imply that the writ er is unconcerned about intrinsic value considerations\nbut instead wants us to trumpet an inte ntion to repurchase so that the stock will rise (or quit going down).  If the writer\nwants to sell tomorrow, his thinking makes sense — for him! — but if he intends to hold, he should instead hope the\nstock falls and trades in enough volume for us to buy a lot of it.  That’s the only way a repurchase program can have\nany real benefit for a continuing shareholder.\nWe will not repurchase shares unless we believe Berkshire stock is selling well below intrinsic value ,\nconservatively calculated.  Nor will we attempt to talk the stock up or down.  (Neither publicly or privately have I ever\ntold anyone to buy or sell Berkshire sh ares.)  Instead we will give all shareholders — and potential shareholders — the\nsame valuation-related information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed.\nRecently,  when the A shares fell below $45,000, we considered making repurchases.  We decided, however, to\ndelay buyin g, if indeed we elect to do any, until shareholders have had the chance to review this report.  If we do find\nthat repurchases mak e sense, we will only rarely place bids on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”).  Instead, we\nwill respond to offers made directly to us at or below the NYSE bid.  If you wish to offer stock, have your broker call\nMark Millard at 402-346-1400.  When a trade occurs, the broker can either record it in the “third market” or on the\nNYSE.  We will favor purchase of the B shares if they are selling at more than a 2% discount to the A.  We will not\nengage in transactions involving fewer than 10 shares of A or 50 shares of B.\nPlease be clear a bout one point: We will never make purchases with the intention of stemming a decline i n\nBerkshire’s price.  Rather we will make them if and when we believe that they represent an attractive use of th e\nCompany’s  money.  At best, repurchases are likely to have only a very minor effect on the future rate of gain in ou r\nstock’s intrinsic value.\n\n18Shareholder-Designated Contributions\nAbout 97.3% of all eligible shares participated in Ber kshire's 1999 shareholder-designated contributions program,\nwith contributions totaling $17.2 million.  A full description of the program appears on pages 70 - 71.\nCumulatively, over the 19 years of the program, Berk shire has made contributions of $147 million pursuant to the\ninstructions  of our shareholders.  The rest of Berkshire's giving is done by our subsidiaries, which stick to th e\nphilanthropic patterns that prevailed bef ore they were acquired (except that their former owners themselves take on the\nresponsibility for their persona l charities).  In aggregate, our subsidiaries made contributions of $13.8 million in 1999,\nincluding in-kind donations of $2.5 million.\nTo particip ate in future programs, you must own Class A shares that are registered in the name of the actua l\nowner, not the nominee name of a broker, bank or depository.  Shares not so registered on August 31, 2000, will be\nineligible  for the 2000 program.  When you get the contributions form from us, return it promptly so that it does not\nget put aside or forgotten.  Designations received after the due date will not be honored.  \nThe Annual Meeting\nThis year’s Woodstock Weekend for Capitalists will follow a format slightly different from that of recent years.\nWe need to make a change because the Aksarben Coliseum, which serv ed us well the past three years, is gradually being\nclosed down.  Therefore, we are reloca ting to the Civic Auditorium (which is on Capitol Avenue between 18  and 19 ,th  th\nbehind the Doubletree Hotel), the only other facility in Omaha offering the space we require.\nThe Civic , however, is located in downtown Omaha, and we would create a parking and traffic nightmare if we\nwere to meet there on a weekday.  We wi ll, therefore, convene on Saturday, April 29, with the doors opening at 7 a.m.,\nthe movie be ginning at 8:30 and the meeting itself commencing at 9:30.  As in the past, we will run until 3:30 with a\nshort break at noon for food, which will be available at the Civic’s concession stands.\nAn attachment to  the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the credential\nyou will need for admission to the meeting and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car reservations, we have again\nsigned up Am erican Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  In our normal fashion, we will run buses from\nthe larger hote ls to the meeting.  After the meeting, the buses will make trips back to the hotels and to Nebrask a\nFurniture Mart, Borsheim’s and the airport.  Even so, you are likely to find a car useful.\nWe have scheduled the meeting in 2002 and 2 003 on the customary first Saturday in May.  In 2001, however, the\nCivic is already book ed on that Saturday, so we will meet on April 28.  The Civic should fit our needs well on an y\nweekend,  since there will then be more than ample parking in nearby lots and garages as well as on streets.  We will\nalso be able to greatly enlarge the space we give exhibitors.  So, overcoming my normal commercial reticence, I will\nsee that you have a wide display of Berkshire products at the Civic that you can purchase .  As a benchmark, in 1999\nshareholde rs bought 3,059 pounds of See’s candy, $16,155 of World Book Products, 1,928 pairs of Dexter shoes, 895\nsets of Quikut knives, 1,752 golf balls wit h the Berkshire Hathaway logo and 3,446 items of Berkshire apparel.  I know\nyou can do better.\nLast year, we also initiated the sale of at least eight fractions of Executive Jet aircraft.  We will again have an array\nof models at the Omaha airport for your inspection on Saturday and Sunday.  Ask an EJA representative at the Civic\nabout viewing any of these planes.\nDairy Queen will  also be on hand at the Civic and again will donate all proceeds to the Children’s Miracl e\nNetwork.   Last  year we sold 4,586 Dilly® bars, fudge bars and vanilla/orange bars.  Additionally, GEICO will have\na booth that will be staffed by a number of our top counselors from around the country, all of them ready to supply you\nwith auto insurance quotes.  In most cases,  GEICO will be able to offer you a special shareholder’s discount.  Bring the\ndetails of your existing insurance, and check out whether we can save you some money.\nFinally, Ajit Jain and his associates will be on hand to offer both no-commission annuities and a liability policy\nwith jumbo limits of a size rarely available elsewhere.  Talk to Ajit and learn how to protect yourself and your family\nagainst a $10 million judgment.\n\n19NFM’s newly remodeled complex, located on a 75-acre site on 72  Street b etween Dodge and Pacific, is open fromnd\n10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.  This operation offers an unrivaled\nbreadth of merchandise — furniture, electronics, appliances, carpets and computers — all at can’t-be-beat prices.  In\n1999 NFM did more than $300 million of business at its 72  Street location, which in a metropolitan area of 675,000nd\nis an absolute miracle.  During the Thursd ay, April 27 to Monday, May 1 period, any shareholder presenting his or her\nmeeting credential will receive a discount that is customarily given only to employees.  We have offered this break to\nshareholders the last couple of years, and sales have been amazing.  In l ast year’s five-day “Berkshire Weekend,” NFM’s\nvolume was $7.98 million, an increase of 26% from 1998 and 51% from 1997.\nBorsheim’s  — the largest jewelry store in the country except for Tiffany’s Manhattan store — will have tw o\nshareholder-only events.  The first will be a champagne and  dessert party from 6 p.m.-10 p.m. on Friday, April 28.  The\nsecond, the  main gala, will be from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday, April 30.  On that day, Charlie and I will be on hand\nto sign sales tickets .  Shareholder prices will be available Thursday through Monday, so if you wish to avoid the largest\ncrowds, which will form on Friday evening and Sunda y, come at other times and identify yourself as a shareholder.  On\nSaturday,  we will be open until 7 p.m.  Borsheim’s operates on a gross margin that is fully twenty percentage points\nbelow that of its major rivals, so be prepared to be blown away by both our prices and selection.\nIn the mall outsi de of Borsheim’s, we will again have Bob Hamman — the best bridge player the game has ever\nseen — available to play with our shar eholders on Sunday.  We will also have a few other experts playing at additional\ntables.  In 1999, we had more demand than tables, but we will cure that problem this year.\nPatrick Wolff, twice US chess champion, will again be in the m all playing blindfolded against all comers.  He tells\nme that he has never tried to play more than four games simultaneously while handicapped this way but might try to\nbump that limit to five or six this year.  If you’re a chess fan, take Patrick on — but be sure to check his blindfold before\nyour first move.\nGorat’s — my favorite steakhouse — w ill again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, April\n30, and will be serv ing from 4 p.m. until about midnight.  Please remember that you can’t come to Gorat’s on Sunday\nwithout a reservati on.  To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 3 ( but not before ).  If Sunday is sold out, try Gorat’s\non one of the other evenings you will be in town.  I make a “quality check” of Gorat’s about once a week and can report\nthat their rare T-bone (with a double order of hash browns) is still unequaled throughout the country.\nThe usual baseball game will be held at Rosenblatt Stadium at 7 p.m. on Saturday night.  This year the Omaha\nGolden Spikes will play the Iowa Cubs.  Come early, because that’s when the real action takes place.  Those wh o\nattended last year saw your Chairman pitch to Ernie Banks.\nThis encounter proved to be the titani c duel that the sports world had long awaited.  After the first few pitches —\nwhich were not my best, but when have I ever thrown  my best? — I fired a brushback at Ernie just to let him know who\nwas in command.   Ernie charged the mound, and I charged the plate.  But a clash was avoided because we becam e\nexhausted before reaching each other.\nErnie was dissatisfied with his performance last year and has been st udying the game films all winter.  As you may\nknow, Ernie had 512 home runs in hi s career as a Cub.  Now that he has spotted telltale weaknesses in my delivery, he\nexpects to get #513 on April 29.  I, howev er, have learned new ways to disguise my “flutterball.”  Come and watch this\nmatchup.\nI should add that I ha ve extracted a promise from Ernie that he will not hit a “come-backer” at me since I would\nnever be able to duck in time to avoid it.  My reflexes are like Woody Allen’s, who said his were so slow that he was\nonce hit by a car being pushed by two guys.\nOur proxy statement contains instructions about obtaining tickets to the game and also a large quantity of other\ninformation that should help you enjoy your visit in Omaha.  Join us at the Capitalist Caper on Capitol Avenue.\nWarren E. Buffett\nMarch 1, 2000 Chairman of the Board",

In this table, Berkshire's results\nthrough 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules.  In all other respects, the results are calculated\nusing the numbers originally reported.\nThe S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax  whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax .  If a corporation such as Berkshire\nwere simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P\n500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P in years when the index\nshowed a negative return.  Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n\n3BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOur gain in net worth during 2000 was $3.96 billion, which increased the per-share book value of both\nour Class A and Class B stock by 6.5%.  Over the last 36 years (that is, since present management took over) per-\nshare book value has grown from $19 to $40,442, a gain of 23.6% compounded annually.∗\nOverall, we had a decent year, our book-value gain having outpaced the performance of the S&P 500.\nAnd, though this judgment is necessarily subjective, we believe Berkshire’s gain in per-share intrinsic value\nmoderately exceeded its gain in book value.  (Intrinsic value, as well as other key investment and accounting terms\nand concepts, are explained in our Owner’s Manual on pages 59-66.  Intrinsic value is discussed on page 64.)\nFurthermore, we completed two significant acquisitions that we negotiated in 1999 and initiated six more.\nAll told, these purchases have cost us about $8 billion, with 97% of that amount paid in cash and 3% in stock.  The\neight businesses we’ve acquired have aggregate sales of about $13 billion and employ 58,000 people.  Still, we\nincurred no debt in making these purchases, and our shares outstanding have increased only 1/3 of 1%.  Better yet,\nwe remain awash in liquid assets and are both eager and ready for even larger acquisitions.\nI will detail our purchases in the next section of the report.  But I will tell you now that we have embraced\nthe 21st century by entering such cutting-edge industries as brick, carpet, insulation and paint.  Try to control your\nexcitement.\nOn the minus side, policyholder growth at GEICO slowed to a halt as the year progressed.  It has become\nmuch more expensive to obtain new business.  I told you last year that we would get our money’s worth from\nstepped-up advertising at GEICO in 2000, but I was wrong.  We’ll examine the reasons later in the report.\nAnother negative — which has persisted for several years — is that we see our equity portfolio as only\nmildly attractive.  We own stocks of some excellent businesses, but most of our holdings are fully priced and are\nunlikely to deliver more than moderate returns in the future.  We’re not alone in facing this problem:  The long-\nterm prospect for equities in general is far from exciting.\nFinally, there is the negative that recurs annually:  Charlie Munger, Berkshire’s Vice Chairman and my\npartner, and I are a year older than when we last reported to you.  Mitigating this adverse development is the\nindisputable fact that the age of your top managers is increasing at a considerably lower rate — percentage-wise  —\nthan is the case at almost all other major corporations.  Better yet, this differential will widen in the future.\nCharlie and I continue to aim at increasing Berkshire’s per-share  value at a rate that, over time, will\nmodestly exceed the gain from owning the S&P 500.  As the table on the facing page shows, a small annual\nadvantage in our favor can, if sustained, produce an anything-but-small long-term advantage.  To reach our goal\nwe will need to add a few good businesses to Berkshire’s stable each year, have the businesses we own generally\ngain in value, and avoid any material increase in our outstanding shares.  We are confident about meeting the last\ntwo objectives; the first will require some luck.\nIt’s appropriate here to thank two groups that made my job both easy and fun last year  just as they do\nevery year.  First, our operating managers continue to run their businesses in splendid fashion, which allows me to\nspend my time allocating capital rather than supervising them.  (I wouldn’t be good at that anyway.)\n                                                       ∗All figures used in this report apply to Berkshire's A shares, the successor to the only stock that the\ncompany had outstanding before 1996.  The B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30th that of the A.\n\n4Our managers are a very special breed.  At most large companies, the truly talented divisional managers\nseldom have the job they really want.  Instead they yearn to become CEOs, either at their present employer or\nelsewhere.  Indeed, if they stay put, they and their colleagues are likely to feel they have failed.\nAt Berkshire, our all-stars have exactly the jobs they want, ones that they hope and expect to keep\nthroughout their business lifetimes.  They therefore concentrate solely on maximizing the long-term value of the\nbusinesses that they “own” and love.  If the businesses succeed, they have succeeded.  And they stick with us:  In\nour last 36 years, Berkshire has never had a manager of a significant subsidiary voluntarily leave to join another\nbusiness.\nThe other group to which I owe enormous thanks is the home-office staff.  After the eight acquisitions\nmore than doubled our worldwide workforce to about 112,000, Charlie and I went soft last year and added one\nmore person at headquarters.  (Charlie, bless him, never lets me forget Ben Franklin’s advice: “A small leak can\nsink a great ship.”)  Now we have 13.8 people.\nThis tiny band works miracles.  In 2000 it handled  all of the details connected with our eight acquisitions,\nprocessed extensive regulatory and tax filings (our tax return covers 4,896 pages), smoothly produced an annual\nmeeting to which 25,000 tickets were issued, and accurately dispensed checks to 3,660 charities designated by our\nshareholders.  In addition, the group dealt with all the routine tasks served up by a company with a revenue run-\nrate of $40 billion and more than 300,000 owners.   And, to add to all of this, the other 12.8 are a delight to be\naround.\nI should pay to have my job.\nAcquisitions of 2000\nOur acquisition technique at Berkshire is simplicity itself: We answer the phone.  I’m also glad to report\nthat it rings a bit more often now, because owners and/or managers increasingly wish to join their companies with\nBerkshire.  Our acquisition criteria are set forth on page 23, and the number to call is 402-346-1400.\nLet me tell you a bit about the businesses we have purchased during the past 14 months, starting with the\ntwo transactions that were initiated in 1999, but closed in 2000.  (This list excludes some smaller purchases that\nwere made by the managers of our subsidiaries and that, in most cases, will be integrated into their operations.)\n• I described the first purchase — 76% of MidAmerican Energy  — in last year’s report.  Because\nof regulatory constraints on our voting privileges, we perform only a “one-line” consolidation of\nMidAmerican’s earnings and equity in our financial statements.  If we instead fully consolidated\nthe company’s figures, our revenues in 2000 would have been $5 billion greater than we\nreported, though net income would remain the same.\n• On November 23, 1999, I received a one-page fax from Bruce Cort that appended a Washington\nPost article describing an aborted buyout of CORT Business Services .  Despite his name, Bruce\nhas no connection with CORT.  Rather, he is an airplane broker who had sold Berkshire a jet in\n1986 and who, before the fax, had not been in touch with me for about ten years.\nI knew nothing about  CORT, but I immediately printed out its SEC filings and liked what I saw.\nThat same day I told Bruce I had a possible interest and asked him to arrange a meeting with\nPaul Arnold, CORT’s CEO.  Paul and I got together on November 29, and I knew at once that we\nhad the right ingredients for a purchase: a fine though unglamorous business, an outstanding\nmanager, and a price (going by that on the failed deal) that made sense.\nOperating out of 117 showrooms, CORT is the national leader in “rent-to-rent” furni ture,\nprimarily used in offices but also by temporary occupants of apartments.  This business, it should\nbe noted, has no similarity to “rent-to-own” operations, which usually involve the sale of home\nfurnishings and electronics to people having limited income and poor credit.\n\n5We quickly purchased CORT for Wesco, our 80%-owned subsidiary, paying about $386 million\nin cash.  You will find more details about CORT’s operations in Wesco’s 1999 and 2000 annual\nreports.  Both Charlie and I enjoy working with Paul, and CORT looks like a good bet to beat our\noriginal expectations.\n• Early last year, Ron Ferguson of General Re put me in contact with Bob Berry, whose family had\nowned U.S. Liability  for 49 years.  This insurer, along with two sister companies, is a medium-\nsized, highly-respected writer of unusual risks — “excess and surplus lines” in insurance jargon.\nAfter Bob and I got in touch, we agreed by phone on a half-stock, half-cash deal.\nIn recent years, Tom Nerney has managed the operation for the Berr y family and has achieved a\nrare combination of excellent growth and unusual profitability.  Tom is a powerhouse in other\nways as well.  In addition to having four adopted children (two from Russia), he has an extended\nfamily: the Philadelphia Belles, a young-teen girls basketball team that Tom coaches.  The team\nhad a 62-4 record last year and finished second in the AAU national tournament.\nFew property-casualty companies are outstanding businesses.  We have far more than our share,\nand U.S. Liability adds luster to the collection.\n• Ben Bridge Jeweler  was another purchase we made by phone, prior to any face-to-face meeting\nbetween me and the management.  Ed Bridge, who with his cousin, Jon, manages this 65-store\nWest Coast retailer, is a friend of Barnett Helzberg, from whom we bought Helzberg Diamonds\nin 1995.  Upon learning that the Bridge family proposed to sell its company, Barnett gave\nBerkshire a strong recommendation.  Ed then called and explained his business to me, also\nsending some figures, and we made a deal, again half for cash and half for stock.\nEd and Jon are fourth generation owner-managers of a business started 89 years ago in Seattle.\nBoth the business and the family— including Herb and Bob, the fathers of Jon and Ed — enjoy\nextraordinary reputations.  Same-store sales have increased by 9%, 11%, 13%, 10%, 12%, 21%\nand 7% over the past seven years, a truly remarkable record.\nIt was vital to the family that the company operate in the future as in the past.  No one wanted\nanother jewelry chain to come in and decimate the organization with ideas about synergy and\ncost saving (which, though they would never work, were certain to be tried).  I told Ed and Jon\nthat they would be in charge, and they knew I could be believed:  After all, it’s obvious that your\nChairman would be a disaster at actually running a store or selling jewelry (though there are\nmembers of his family who have earned black belts as purchasers).\nIn their typically classy way, the Bridges allocated a substantial portion of th e proceeds from their\nsale to the hundreds of co-workers who had helped the company achieve its success.  We’re\nproud to be associated with both the family and the company.\n• In July we acquired Justin Industries , the leading maker of Western boots — including the\nJustin, Tony Lama, Nocona, and Chippewa brands  and the premier producer of brick in Texas\nand five neighboring states.\nHere again, our acquisition involved serendipity.  On May 4th, I received a fax from Mark Jones,\na stranger to me, proposing that Berkshire join a group to acquire an unnamed company.  I faxed\nhim back, explaining that with rare exceptions we don’t invest with others, but would happily\npay him a commission if he sent details and we later made a purchase.  He replied that the\n“mystery company” was Justin.  I then went to Fort Worth to meet John Roach, chairman of the\ncompany and John Justin, who had built the business and was its major shareholder.  Soon after,\nwe bought Justin for $570 million in cash.\nJohn Justin loved Justin Industries but had been forced to retire because of severe health problems\n(which sadly led to his death in late February).  John was a class act  as a citizen, businessman\nand human being.  Fortunately, he had groomed two outstanding managers, Harrold Melton at\nAcme and Randy Watson at Justin Boot, each of whom runs his company autonomously.\n\n6Acme, the larger of the two operations, produces more than one billion bricks per year at its 22\nplants, about 11.7% of the industry’s national output.  The brick business, however, is necessarily\nregional, and in its territory Acme enjoys unquestioned leadership. When Texans are asked to\nname a brand of brick, 75% respond Acme, compared to 16% for the runner-up.  (Before our\npurchase, I couldn’t have named a brand of brick.  Could you have?)  This brand recognition is\nnot only due to Acme’s product quality, but also reflects many decades of extraordinary\ncommunity service by both the company and John Justin.\nI can’t resist pointing out that Berkshire — whose top mana gement has long been mired in the\n19th century — is now one of the very few authentic “clicks-and-bricks” businesses around.  We\nwent into 2000 with GEICO doing significant business on the Internet, and then we added Acme.\nYou can bet this move by Berkshire is making them sweat in Silicon Valley.\n• In June, Bob Shaw, CEO of Shaw Industries , the world’s largest carpet manufacturer, came to\nsee me with his partner, Julian Saul, and the CEO of a second company with which Shaw was\nmulling a merger.  The potential partner, however, faced huge asbestos liabilities from past\nactivities, and any deal depended on these being eliminated through insurance.\nThe executives visiting me wanted Berkshire to provide a policy that would pay all future\nasbestos costs.  I explained that though we could write an exceptionally large policy — far larger\nthan any other insurer would ever think of offering — we would never issue a policy that lacked\na cap.\nBob and Julian decided that if we didn’t want to bet the ranch on the exte nt of the acquiree’s\nliability, neither did they.  So their deal died.  But my interest in Shaw was sparked, and a few\nmonths later Charlie and I met with Bob to work out a purchase by Berkshire.  A key feature of\nthe deal was that both Bob and Julian were to continue owning at least 5% of Shaw.  This leaves\nus associated with the best in the business as shown by Bob and Julian’s record: Each built a\nlarge, successful carpet business before joining forces in 1998.\nShaw has annual sales of about $4 billion,  and we own 87.3% of the company.  Leaving aside our\ninsurance operation, Shaw is by far our largest business.  Now, if people walk all over us, we\nwon’t mind.\n• In July, Bob Mundheim, a director of Benjamin Moore Paint , called to ask if Berkshire might\nbe interested in acquiring it.  I knew Bob from Salomon, where he was general counsel during\nsome difficult times, and held him in very high regard.  So my answer was “Tell me more.”\nIn late August, Charlie and I met with Richard Roob and Yvan Dupuy, past and present CEOs of\nBenjamin Moore.  We liked them; we liked the business; and we made a $1 billion cash offer on\nthe spot.  In October, their board approved the transaction, and we completed it in December.\nBenjamin Moore has been making paint for 117 years and has thousands of independent dealers\nthat are a vital asset to its business.  Make sure you specify our product for your next paint job.\n• Finally, in late December, we agreed to buy Johns Manville Corp.  for about $1.8 billion.  This\ncompany’s incredible odyssey over the last few decades  too multifaceted to be chronicled here\n was shaped by its long history as a manufacturer of asbestos products.  The much-publicized\nhealth problems that affected many people exposed to asbestos led to JM’s declaring bankruptcy\nin 1982.\nSubsequently, the bankruptcy court established a trust for victims, the major asset of which was a\ncontrolling interest in JM.  The trust, which sensibly wanted to diversify its assets, agreed last\nJune to sell the business to an LBO buyer.  In the end, though, the LBO group was unable to\nobtain financing.\n\n7Consequently, the deal was called off on Friday, December 8th.  The following Monday, Charlie\nand I called Bob Felise, chairman of the trust, and made an all-cash offer with no financing\ncontingencies.  The next day the trustees voted tentatively to accept our offer, and a week later we\nsigned a contract.\nJM is the nation’s leading producer of commercial and industrial insulation and also has major\npositions in roofing systems and a variety of engineered products.  The company’s sales exceed\n$2 billion and the business has earned good, if cyclical, returns.  Jerry Henry, JM’s CEO, had\nannounced his retirement plans a year ago, but I’m happy to report that Charlie and I have\nconvinced him to stick around.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nTwo economic factors probably contributed to the rush of acquisition activity we experienced last year.\nFirst, many managers and owners foresaw near-term slowdowns in their businesses  and, in fact, we purchased\nseveral companies whose earnings will almost certainly decline this year from peaks they reached in 1999 or 2000.\nThe declines make no difference to us, given that we expect all of our businesses to now and then have ups and\ndowns.  (Only in the sales presentations of investment banks do earnings move forever upward.)  We don’t care\nabout the bumps; what matters are the overall results.  But the decisions of other people are sometimes affected by\nthe near-term outlook, which can both spur sellers and temper the enthusiasm of purchasers who might otherwise\ncompete with us.\nA second factor that helped us in 2000 was that the market for junk bonds dried up as the year progressed.\nIn the two preceding years, junk bond purchasers had relaxed their standards, buying the obligations of ever-\nweaker issuers at inappropriate prices.  The effects of this laxity were felt last year in a ballooning of defaults.  In\nthis environment, “financial” buyers of businesses  those who wish to buy using only a sliver of equity \nbecame unable to borrow all they thought they needed.  What they could still borrow, moreover, came at a high\nprice.  Consequently, LBO operators became less aggressive in their bidding when businesses came up for sale last\nyear.  Because we analyze purchases on an all-equity basis, our evaluations did not change, which means we\nbecame considerably more competitive.\nAside from the economic factors that benefited us, we now enjoy a major and growing advantage in\nmaking acquisitions in that we are often the buyer of choice for the seller.  That fact, of course, doesn’t assure a\ndeal  sellers have to like our price, and we have to like their business and management  but it does help.\nWe find it meaningful when an owner cares about whom he sells to.  We like to do business with someone\nwho loves his company, not just the money that a sale will bring him (though we certainly understand why he likes\nthat as well).  When this emotional attachment exists, it signals that important qualities will likely be found within\nthe business: honest accounting, pride of product, respect for customers, and a loyal group of associates having a\nstrong sense of direction.  The reverse is apt to be true, also.  When an owner auctions off his business, exhibiting a\ntotal lack of interest in what follows, you will frequently find that it has been dressed up for sale, particularly when\nthe seller is a “financial owner.”  And if owners behave with little regard for their business and its people, their\nconduct will often contaminate attitudes and practices throughout the company.\nWhen a business masterpiece has been created by a lifetime — or several lifetimes — of unstinting care\nand exceptional talent, it should be important to the owner what corporation is entrusted to carry on its history.\nCharlie and I believe Berkshire provides an almost unique home.  We take our obligations to the people who\ncreated a business very seriously, and Berkshire’s ownership structure ensures that we can fulfill our promises.\nWhen we tell John Justin that his business will remain headquartered in Fort Worth, or assure the Bridge family\nthat its operation will not be merged with another jeweler, these sellers can take those promises to the bank.\nHow much better it is for the “painter” of a business Rembrandt to personally select its permanent home\nthan to have a trust officer or uninterested heirs auction it off.  Throughout the years we have had great experiences\nwith those who recognize that truth and apply it to their business creations.  We’ll leave the auctions to others.\n\n8The Economics of Property/Casualty Insurance\nOur main business — though we have others of great importance — is insurance.  To understand\nBerkshire, therefore, it is necessary that you understand how to evaluate an insurance company.  The key\ndeterminants are: (1) the amount of float that the business generates; (2) its cost; and (3) most critical of all, the\nlong-term outlook for both of these factors.\nTo begin with, float is money we hold but don't own.  In an insur ance operation, float arises because\npremiums are received before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends over many years.  During that\ntime, the insurer invests the money.  This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside:  The premiums that\nan insurer takes in usually do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay.  That leaves it running an\n\"underwriting loss,\" which is the cost of float.  An insurance business has value if its cost of float over time is less\nthan the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain funds.  But the business is a lemon if its cost of float is\nhigher than market rates for money.\nA caution is appropriate here:  Because loss costs must be estimated, insurers have enormous latitude in\nfiguring their underwriting results, and that makes it very difficult for investors to calculate a company's true cost\nof float.  Errors of estimation, usually innocent but sometimes not, can be huge.  The consequences of these\nmiscalculations flow directly into earnings.  An experienced observer can usually detect large-scale errors in\nreserving, but the general public can typically do no more than accept what's presented, and at times I have been\namazed by the numbers that big-name auditors have implicitly blessed.  Both the income statements and balance\nsheets of insurers can be minefields.\nAt Berkshire, we strive to be both consistent and conservative in our reserving.  But we will make\nmistakes.  And we warn you that there is nothing symmetrical about surprises in the insurance business: They\nalmost always are unpleasant.\nThe table that follows shows (at intervals) the float generated by the various segments of Berkshire’s\ninsurance operations since we entered the business 34 years ago upon acquiring National Indemnity Company\n(whose traditional lines are included in the segment “Other Primary”).  For the table we have calculated our float\n— which we generate in large amounts relative to our premium volume — by adding net loss reserves, loss\nadjustment reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned premium reserves, and then subtracting\ninsurance-related receivables, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid taxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed\nreinsurance.  (Don’t panic, there won’t be a quiz.)\nYearend Float (in $ millions)\nOther Other\nYear GEICO General Re Reinsurance Primary Total\n1967 20 20\n1977 40 131 171\n1987 701 807 1,508\n1997 2,917 4,014 455 7,386\n1998 3,125 14,909 4,305 415 22,754\n1999 3,444 15,166 6,285 403 25,298\n2000 3,943 15,525 7,805 598 27,871\nWe’re pleased by the growth in our float during 2000 but not happy with its cost.  Over the years, our cost\nof float has been very close to zero, with the underwriting profits realized in most years offsetting the occasional\nterrible year such as 1984, when our cost was a staggering 19%.  In 2000, however, we had an underwriting loss of\n$1.6 billion, which gave us a float cost of 6%.  Absent a mega-catastrophe, we expect our float cost to fall in 2001\n perhaps substantially  in large part because of corrections in pricing at General Re that should increasingly be\nfelt as the year progresses.  On a smaller scale, GEICO may experience the same improving trend.\nThere are two factors affecting our cost of floa t that are very rare at other insurers but that now loom large\nat Berkshire.  First, a few insurers that are  currently  experiencing  large losses have offloaded a significant portion of\n\n9these on us in a manner that penalizes our current earnings but gives us float we can use for many years to come.\nAfter the loss that we incur in the first year of the policy, there are no further costs attached to this business.\nWhen these policies are properly priced, we welcome the pain-today, gain-tomorrow effects the y have.  In\n1999, $400 million of our underwriting loss (about 27.8% of the total) came from business of this kind and in 2000\nthe figure was $482 million (34.4% of our loss).  We have no way of predicting how much similar business we will\nwrite in the future, but what we do get will typically be in large chunks.  Because these transactions can materially\ndistort our figures, we will tell you about them as they occur.\nOther reinsurers have little taste for this insurance.  They simply can’t stomach what hu ge underwriting\nlosses do to their reported results, even though these losses are produced by policies whose overall economics are\ncertain to be favorable.  You should be careful, therefore, in comparing our underwriting results with those of other\ninsurers.\nAn even more significant item in our numbers — which, again, you won’t find much of elsewhere —\narises from transactions in which we assume past losses of a company that wants to put its troubles behind it.  To\nillustrate, the XYZ insurance company might have last year bought a policy obligating us to pay the first $1 billion\nof losses and loss adjustment expenses from events that happened in, say, 1995 and earlier years.  These contracts\ncan be very large, though we always require a cap on our exposure.  We entered into a number of such transactions\nin 2000 and expect to close several more in 2001.\nUnder GAAP accounting, this “retroactive” insurance neither benefits nor penalizes our current earnings.\nInstead, we set up an asset called “deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance,” in an amount reflecting\nthe difference between the premium we receive and the (higher) losses we expect to pay (for which reserves are\nimmediately established).  We then amortize this asset by making annual charges to earnings that create equivalent\nunderwriting losses.  You will find the amount of the loss that we incur from these transactions in both our\nquarterly and annual management discussion.  By their nature, these losses will continue for many years, often\nstretching into decades.  As an offset, though, we have the use of float  lots of it.\nClearly, float carrying an annual cost of this kind is not as desirable as float we generate from policies that\nare expected to produce an underwriting profit (of which we have plenty).  Nevertheless, this retroactive insurance\nshould be decent business for us.\nThe net of all this is that a) I expect our cost of float to be very attractive in the future but b) rarely to\nreturn to a “no-cost” mode because of the annual charge that retroactive reinsurance will lay on us.  Also —\nobviously  the ultimate benefits that we derive from float will depend not only on its cost but, fully as important,\nhow effectively we deploy it.\nOur retroactive business is almost single-handedly the work of Ajit Jain, whose praises I sing annually.  It\nis impossible to overstate how valuable Ajit is to Berkshire.  Don’t worry about my health; worry about his.\nLast year, Ajit brought home a $2.4 billion reinsurance premium, perhaps the largest in history, from a\npolicy that retroactively covers a major U.K. company.  Subsequently, he wrote a large policy protecting the Texas\nRangers from the possibility that Alex Rodriguez will become permanently disabled.   As sports fans know, “A-Rod”\nwas signed for $252 million, a record, and we think that our policy probably also set a record for disability\ninsurance.  We cover many other sports figures as well.\nIn another example of his versatility, Ajit last fall negotiated a very interesting deal with Grab.co m, an\nInternet company whose goal was to attract millions of people to its site and there to extract information from them\nthat would be useful to marketers.  To lure these people, Grab.com held out the possibility of a $1 billion prize\n(having a $170 million present value) and we insured its payment.  A message on the site explained that the\nchance of anyone winning the prize was low, and indeed no one won.  But the possibility of a win was far from nil.\nWriting such a policy, we receive a modest premium,  face the possibility of a huge loss, and get good\nodds. Very few insurers like that equation.  And they’re unable to cure their unhappiness by reinsurance.  Because\neach policy has unusual  and sometimes unique  characteristics, insurers can’t  lay off the occasional shock loss\n\n10through their standard reinsurance arrangements.   Therefore, any insurance CEO doing a piece of business like this\nmust run the small, but real, risk of a horrible  quarterly earnings number, one that he would not enjoy explaining to\nhis board or shareholders.   Charlie and I, however, like any proposition that makes compelling mathematical sense,\nregardless of its effect on reported earnings.\nAt General Re, the news has turned considerably better:  Ron Ferguson, along with Joe Brandon,  Tad\nMontross, and a talented supporting cast took many actions during 2000 to bring that company’s profitability back\nto past standards.  Though our pricing is not fully corrected, we have significantly repriced business that was\nseverely unprofitable or dropped it altogether.  If there’s no mega-catastrophe in 2001, General Re’s float cost\nshould fall materially.\nThe last couple of years haven’t been any fun for Ron and his crew.  But they have stepped up to tough\ndecisions, and Charlie and I applaud them for these.  General Re has several important and enduring business\nadvantages.  Better yet, it has managers who will make the most of them.\nIn aggregate, our smaller insurance operations produced an excellent underwriting profit in 2000 while\ngenerating significant float — just as they have done for more than a decade.  If these companies were a single and\nseparate operation, people would consider it an outstanding insurer.  Because the companies instead reside in an\nenterprise as large as Berkshire, the world may not appreciate their accomplishments — but I sure do.  Last year I\nthanked Rod Eldred, John Kizer, Don Towle and Don Wurster, and I again do so.  In addition, we now also owe\nthanks to Tom Nerney at U.S. Liability and Michael Stearns, the new head of Cypress.\nYou may notice that Brad Kinstler,  who was CEO of Cypress and whose praises I’ve sung in the past, is no\nlonger in the list above.  That’s because we needed a new manager at Fechheimer Bros., our Cincinnati-based\nuniform company, and called on Brad.  We seldom move Berkshire managers from one enterprise to another, but\nmaybe we should try it more often:  Brad is hitting home runs in his new job, just as he always did at Cypress.\nGEICO (1-800-847-7536 or GEICO.com)\nWe show below the usual ta ble detailing GEICO’s growth.  Last year I enthusiastically told you that we\nwould step up our expenditures on advertising in 2000 and that the added dollars were the best investment that\nGEICO could make.  I was wrong:  The extra money we spent did not produce a commensurate increase in\ninquiries.  Additionally, the percentage of inquiries that we converted into sales fell for the first time in many\nyears.  These negative developments combined to produce a sharp increase in our per-policy acquisition cost.\nNew Auto Auto Policies\nYears Policies(1)In-Force(1)\n1993 346,882 2,011,055\n1994 384,217 2,147,549\n1995 443,539 2,310,037\n1996 592,300 2,543,699\n1997 868,430 2,949,439\n1998 1,249,875 3,562,644\n1999 1,648,095 4,328,900\n2000 1,472,853 4,696,842\n(1)  “Voluntary” only; excludes assigned risks and the like.\nAgonizing over errors is a mistake.  But acknowledging and analyzing them can be useful, though that\npractice is rare in corporate boardrooms.   There, Charlie  and I have  almost never witnessed a candid post-mortem of\na failed decision, particularly one involving an acquisition .  A notable exception to this never-look-back approach is\nthat of The Washington Post Company, which unfailingly and objectively reviews its acquisitions three years after\nthey are made.  Elsewhere, triumphs are trumpeted, but dumb decisions either get no follow-up or are rationalized.\n\n11The financial consequences of these boners are regularly dumped into massive restructuring charges or\nwrite-offs that are casually waved off as “nonrecurring.”  Managements just love these.  Indeed, in recent years it\nhas seemed that no earnings statement is complete without them.  The origins of these charges, though, are never\nexplored.  When it comes to corporate blunders, CEOs invoke the concept of the Virgin Birth.\nTo get back to our examination of GEICO:  There are at least four factors that could account for the\nincreased costs we experienced in obtaining new business last year, and all probably contributed in some manner.\nFirst, in our advertising we have pushed “frequency” very hard, and we probably overstepped in certain\nmedia.  We’ve always known that increasing the number of messages through any medium would eventually\nproduce diminishing returns.   The third ad in an hour on a given cable channel is simply not going to be as effective\nas the first.\nSecond, we may have already picked much of the low-hanging fruit.  Clearly, the willingness to do\nbusiness with a direct marketer of insurance varies widely among individuals:  Indeed, some percentage of\nAmericans  particularly older ones  are reluctant to make direct purchases of any kind.  Over the years,\nhowever, this reluctance will ebb.  A new generation with new habits will find the savings from direct purchase of\ntheir auto insurance too compelling to ignore.\nAnother factor that surely decreased the conversion of inquiries into sales was stricter underwriting by\nGEICO.  Both the frequency and severity of losses increased during the year, and rates in certain areas became\ninadequate, in some cases substantially so. In these instances, we necessarily tightened our underwriting standards.\nThis tightening, as well as the many rate increases we put in during the year, made our offerings less attractive to\nsome prospects.\nA high percentage of callers, it should be emphasized, can still save money by insuring with us.\nUnderstandably, however, some prospects will switch to save $200 per year but will not switch to save $50.\nTherefore, rate increases that bring our prices closer to those of our competitors will hurt our acceptance rate, even\nwhen we continue to offer the best deal.\nFinally, the competitive picture changed in at least one important respect:  State Farm  by far the largest\npersonal auto insurer, with about 19% of the market — has been very slow to raise prices.  Its costs, however, are\nclearly increasing right along with those of the rest of the industry.  Consequently, State Farm had an underwriting\nloss last year from auto insurance (including rebates to policyholders) of 18% of premiums, compared to 4% at\nGEICO.   Our loss produced a float cost for us of 6.1%, an unsatisfactory result.  (Indeed, at GEICO we expect float,\nover time, to be free.)  But we estimate that State Farm’s float cost in 2000 was about 23%.  The willingness of the\nlargest player in the industry to tolerate such a cost makes the economics difficult for other participants.\nThat does not take away from the fact that State Farm is one of America’s greatest business stories.  I’ve\nurged that the company be studied at business schools because it has achieved fabulous success while following a\npath that in many ways defies the dogma  of those institutions.   Studying counter-evidence is a highly useful activity,\nthough not one always greeted with enthusiasm at citadels of learning.\nState Farm was launched in 1922, by a 45-year-old, semi-retired Illinois farmer, to compete with long-\nestablished insurers  haughty institutions in New York, Philadelphia and Hartford  that possessed\noverwhelming advantages in capital, reputation, and distribution.  Because State Farm is a mutual company, its\nboard members and managers could not be owners, and it had no access to capital markets during its years of fast\ngrowth.  Similarly, the business never had the stock options or lavish salaries that many people think vital if an\nAmerican enterprise is to attract able managers and thrive.\nIn the end, however, State Farm eclipsed all its competitors.  In fact, by 1999 the company had amassed a\ntangible net worth exceeding that of all but four American businesses.  If you  want to read how this happened, get a\ncopy of The Farmer from Merna .\n\n12Despite State Farm’s strengths, however, GEICO has much the better business model, one that embodies\nsignificantly lower operating costs.  And, when a company is selling a product with commodity-like economic\ncharacteristics, being the low-cost producer is all-important.  This enduring competitive advantage of GEICO \none it possessed in 1951 when,  as a 20-year-old student, I first became enamored with its stock  is the reason that\nover time it will inevitably increase its market share significantly while simultaneously achieving excellent profits.\nOur growth will be slow, however, if State Farm elects to continue bearing the underwriting losses that it is now\nsuffering.\nTony Nicely, GEICO’s CEO, remains an owner’s dream.  Everything he does makes sense.  He never\nengages in wishful  thinking  or otherwise  distorts reality, as so many managers do when the unexpected happens.  As\n2000 unfolded, Tony cut back on advertising that was not cost-effective, and he will continue to do that in 2001 if\ncutbacks are called for (though we will always maintain a massive  media presence).  Tony has also aggressively\nfiled for price increases where we need them.  He looks at the loss reports every day and is never behind the curve.\nTo steal a line from a competitor, we are in good hands with Tony.\nI’ve told you about our profit-sharing arrangement at GEICO that targets only two variables — growth i n\npolicies and the underwriting results of seasoned business.  Despite the headwinds of 2000, we still had a\nperformance that produced an 8.8% profit-sharing payment, amounting to $40.7 million.\nGEICO will be a huge part of Berkshire’s future.  Because of  its rock-bottom operating costs, it offers a\ngreat many Americans the cheapest way to purchase a high-ticket product that they must buy.  The company then\ncouples this bargain with service that consistently ranks high in independent surveys.  That’s a combination\ninevitably producing growth and profitability.\nIn just the last few years, far more drivers have learned to associate the GEICO brand with saving money\non their insurance.  We will pound that theme relentlessly until all Americans are aware of the value that we offer.\nInvestments\nBelow we present our common stock investments.  Those that had a market value of more than $1 billion\nat the end of 2000 are itemized.\n12/31/00\nShares Company Cost Market\n(dollars in millions)\n151,610,700 American Express Company ................................ ................................ ..$1,470 $  8,329\n200,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company ................................ ................................ ....... 1,299 12,188\n96,000,000 The Gillette Company ................................ ................................ ............ 600 3,468\n1,727,765 The Washington Post Company ................................ ............................. 11 1,066\n55,071,380 Wells Fargo & Company ................................ ................................ ........ 319 3,067\nOthers................................ ................................ ................................ ....     6,703       9,501\nTotal Common Stocks ................................ ................................ ............  $10,402 $_37,619\nIn 2000,  we sold nearly all of our Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae shares, established 15% positions in several\nmid-sized companies, bought the high-yield bonds of a few issuers (very few — the category is not labeled junk\nwithout reason) and added to our holdings of high-grade, mortgage-backed securities.  There are no “bargains”\namong our current holdings:  We’re content with what we own but far from excited by it.\nMany people assume that marketable securities are Berk shire’s first choice when allocating capital, but\nthat’s not true: Ever since we first published our economic principles in 1983, we have consistently stated that we\nwould rather purchase businesses than stocks.  (See number 4 on page 60.)  One reason for that preference is\npersonal, in that I love working with our managers.  They are high-grade, talented and loyal.  And, frankly, I find\ntheir business behavior to be more rational and owner-oriented than that prevailing at many public companies.\n\n13But there’s also a powerful financial reason behind the preference, and that has to do with taxes.  The tax\ncode makes Berkshire’s owning 80% or more of a business far more profitable for us, proportionately, than our\nowning a smaller share.  When a company we own all of earns $1 million after tax, the entire amount inures to our\nbenefit.  If the $1 million is upstreamed to Berkshire, we owe no tax on the dividend.  And, if the earnings are\nretained and we were to sell the subsidiary  not likely at Berkshire!  for $1million more than we paid for it, we\nwould owe no capital gains tax.  That’s because our “tax cost” upon sale would include both what we paid for the\nbusiness and all earnings it subsequently retained.\nContrast that situation to what happens when w e own an investment in a marketable security.   There, if we\nown a 10% stake in a business earning $10 million after tax, our $1 million share of the earnings is subject to\nadditional  state and federal taxes of (1) about $140,000 if it is distributed to us (our tax rate on most dividends is\n14%); or (2) no less than $350,000 if the $1 million is retained and subsequently captured by us in the form of a\ncapital gain (on which our tax rate is usually about 35%, though it sometimes approaches 40%).  We may defer\npaying the $350,000 by not immediately realizing our gain, but eventually we must pay the tax.  In effect, the\ngovernment is our “partner” twice when we own part of a business through a stock investment, but only once when\nwe own at least 80%.\nLeaving a side tax factors, the formula we use for evaluating stocks and businesses is identical.  Indeed, the\nformula for valuing all assets that are purchased for financial gain has been unchanged since it was first laid out by\na very smart man in about 600 B.C.  (though he wasn’t smart enough to know it was 600 B.C.).\nThe oracle was Aesop and his enduring, though somewhat incomplete, investment insight was “a bird in\nthe hand is worth two in the bush.”  To flesh out this principle, you must answer only three questions.  How certain\nare you that there are indeed birds in the bush?  When will they emerge and how many will there be?  What is the\nrisk-free interest rate (which we consider to be the yield on long-term U.S. bonds)?  If you can answer these three\nquestions, you will know the maximum value of the bush  and the maximum number of the birds you now\npossess that should be offered for it.  And, of course, don’t literally think birds.  Think dollars.\nAesop’s investment axiom, thus expanded and converted into d ollars, is immutable.  It applies to outlays\nfor farms,  oil royalties, bonds, stocks, lottery tickets, and manufacturing plants.   And neither the advent of the steam\nengine, the harnessing of electricity nor the creation of the automobile changed the formula one iota — nor will the\nInternet.  Just insert the correct numbers, and you can rank the attractiveness of all possible uses of capital\nthroughout the universe.\nCommon yardsticks such as dividend yield, the  ratio of price to earnings or to book value, and even growth\nrates have nothing  to do with valuation except to the extent they provide clues to the amount and timing of cash\nflows into and from the business.  Indeed, growth can destroy value if it requires cash inputs in the early years of a\nproject or enterprise that exceed the discounted value of the cash that those assets will generate in later years.\nMarket commentators and investment managers who glibly refer to “growth” and “value” styles as contrasting\napproaches to investment are displaying their  ignorance, not their sophistication.   Growth is simply a component \nusually a plus, sometimes a minus  in the value equation.\nAlas, though Aesop’s proposition and the third variable  that is,  interest rates  are simple, plugging in\nnumbers for the other two variables is a difficult task.  Using precise numbers is, in fact, foolish; working with a\nrange of possibilities is the better approach.\nUsually, the range must be so wide that no useful conclusion can be reached.  Occasionally, though, even\nvery conservative estimates about the future emergence of birds reveal that the price quoted is startlingly low in\nrelation to value.  (Let’s call this phenomenon the IBT  Inefficient Bush Theory.)  To be sure, an investor needs\nsome general understanding of business economics as well as the ability to think independently to reach a well-\nfounded positive conclusion.  But the investor does not need brilliance nor blinding insights.\nAt the other extreme, there are many times when the most brilliant of investors can’t muster a conviction\nabout the birds to emerge, not even when a very broad range of estimates is employed.  This kind of uncertainty\nfrequently occurs when new businesses and rapidly changing industries are under examination.   In cases of this sort,\nany capital commitment must be labeled speculative.\n\n14Now, speculation — in which the focus is not on what an asset will produce but rather on what the next\nfellow will pay for it — is neither illegal, immoral nor un-American.  But it is not a game in which Charlie and I\nwish to play.  We bring nothing to the party, so why should we expect to take anything home?\nThe line separating investment and speculation, which is never bright and clear, becomes blurred still\nfurther when most market participants have recently enjoyed triumphs.  Nothing sedates rationality like large doses\nof effortless money.  After a heady experience of that kind, normally sensible people drift into behavior akin to that\nof Cinderella at the ball.   They know that overstaying the festivities  that is, continuing to speculate in companies\nthat have gigantic valuations relative to the cash they are likely to generate in the future  will eventually bring on\npumpkins and mice.   But they nevertheless hate to miss a single minute of what is one helluva party.   Therefore, the\ngiddy participants all plan to leave just seconds before midnight.  There’s a problem, though: They are dancing in\na room in which the clocks have no hands.\nLast year, we commented on the exuberance  and, yes, it was irrational  that prevailed, noting that\ninvestor expectations had grown to be several multiples of probable returns.  One piece of evidence came from a\nPaine Webber-Gallup survey of investors conducted in December 1999, in which the participants were asked their\nopinion about the annual returns investors could expect to realize over the decade ahead.  Their answers averaged\n19%.  That, for sure, was an irrational expectation:  For American business as a whole, there couldn’t possibly be\nenough birds in the 2009 bush to deliver such a return.\nFar more irrational still were the huge valuations that market participants were then putting on businesses\nalmost certain to end up being of modest or no value.  Yet investors, mesmerized by soaring stock prices and\nignoring all else, piled into these enterprises.   It was as if some virus, racing wildly among investment professionals\nas well as amateurs, induced hallucinations in which the values of stocks in certain sectors became decoupled from\nthe values of the businesses that underlay them.\nThis surreal scene was accompanied by much loose talk about “value creation.”  We readily acknowledge\nthat there has been a huge amount of true value created in the past decade by new or young businesses, and that\nthere is much more to come.  But value is destroyed, not created, by any business that loses money over its lifetime,\nno matter how high its interim valuation may get.\nWhat actually occurs in these cases is wealth transfer , often on a massive scale.  By shamelessly\nmerchandising birdless bushes, promoters have in recent years moved billions of dollars from the pockets of the\npublic to their own purses (and to those  of their friends and associates).   The fact is that a  bubble market has allowed\nthe creation of bubble companies, entities designed more with an eye to making money off investors rather than for\nthem.  Too often, an IPO, not profits, was the primary goal of a company’s promoters.  At bottom, the “business\nmodel” for these companies has been the old-fashioned chain letter, for which  many fee-hungry investment bankers\nacted as eager postmen.\nBut a pin lies in wait for every bubble.  And when the two eventually meet, a new wave of investors learns\nsome very old lessons:   First, many in Wall Street  a community in which quality control is not prized  will sell\ninvestors anything they will buy.  Second, speculation is most dangerous when it looks easiest.\nAt Berkshire, we make no attempt to pick the few winners that will emerge from an ocean of unproven\nenterprises.  We’re not smart enough to do that, and we know it.  Instead, we try to apply Aesop’s 2,600-year-old\nequation to opportunities in which we have reasonable confidence as to how many birds are in the bush and when\nthey will emerge  (a formulation that my grandsons would probably update to “A girl in a convertible is worth five\nin the phonebook.”).  Obviously, we can never precisely predict the timing of cash flows in and out of a business or\ntheir exact amount.  We try, therefore, to keep our estimates conservative and to focus on industries where business\nsurprises are unlikely to wreak havoc on owners.  Even so, we make many mistakes:  I’m the fellow, remember,\nwho thought he understood the future economics of trading stamps, textiles, shoes and second-tier department\nstores.\nLately, the most promising “bushes” have been negotiated transactions for entire businesses, and that\npleases us.  You should clearly understand, however, that these acquisitions will at best provide us only reasonable\nreturns.  Really juicy results from negotiated deals can be anticipated only when capital markets are severely\nconstrained and the whole business world is pessimistic.  We are 180 degrees from that point.\n\n15Sources of Reported Earnings\nThe table that follows shows t he main sources of Berkshire's reported earnings.  In this presentation,\npurchase-accounting adjustments are not assigned to the specific businesses to which they apply, but are instead\naggregated and shown separately.  This procedure lets you view the earnings of our businesses as they would have\nbeen reported had we not purchased them.  For the  reasons discussed on page 65, this form of presentation seems to\nus to be more useful to investors and managers than one utilizing generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),\nwhich require purchase-premiums to be charged off business-by-business.  The total net earnings we show in the\ntable are, of course, identical to the GAAP total in our audited financial statements.\n(in millions)\nBerkshire's Share\nof Net Earnings\n(after taxes and\nPre-Tax Earnings minority interests)\n2000 1999 2000 1999\nOperating Earnings:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting – Reinsurance ................................ .$(1,399) $(1,440) $(899) $(927)\nUnderwriting – GEICO ................................ ........

In our shoe businesses generally, our attempt to keep the\nbulk of our production in domestic factories has cost us dearly.  We face another very tough year in 2001 also, as\nwe make significant changes in how we do business.\nI clearly made a mistake in paying what I did for Dexter in 1993.  Furthermore, I compounded that\nmistake in a huge way by using Berkshire shares in payment.  Last year, to recognize my error, we charged off all\nthe remaining accounting goodwill that was attributable to the Dexter transaction.  We may regain some economic\ngoodwill at Dexter in the future, but we clearly have none at present.\nThe managers o f our shoe businesses are first-class from both a business and human perspective.  They\nare working very hard at a tough  and often terribly painful  job, even though their personal financial\ncircumstances don’t require them to do so.  They have my admiration and thanks.\n\n16On a more pleasant note, we continue to be the undisputed leader in two branches of Aircraft Services \npilot training at FlightSafety (FSI) and fractional ownership of business jets at Executive Jet (EJA).  Both\ncompanies are run by their remarkable founders.\nAl Ueltschi at FSI is now 83  and continues to operate at full throttle.   Though I am not a fan of stock splits,\nI am planning to split Al’s age 2-for-1 when he hits 100.  (If it works, guess who’s next.)\nWe spent $272 million on flight si mulators in 2000, and we’ll spend a similar amount this year.  Anyone\nwho thinks that the annual charges for depreciation don’t reflect a real cost  every bit as real as payroll or raw\nmaterials  should get an internship at a simulator company.  Every year we spend amounts equal to our\ndepreciation charge simply to stay in the same economic place  and then spend additional sums to grow.  And\ngrowth is in prospect for FSI as far as the eye can see.\nEven faster growth awaits EJA (whose fractional-ownershi p program is called NetJets ).  Rich Santulli is\nthe dynamo behind this business.\nLast year I told you that EJA’s recurring revenue from monthly management fees and hourly usage grew\nby 46% in 1999.  In 2000 the growth was 49%.  I also told you that this was a low-margin business, in which\nsurvivors will be few.  Margins were indeed slim at EJA last year, in part because of the major costs we are\nincurring in developing our business in Europe.\nRegardless of the cost, you can be sure that EJA’s spending on  safety will be whatever is needed.\nObviously, we would follow this policy under any circumstances, but there’s some self-interest here as well:  I, my\nwife, my children,  my sisters, my 94-year-old aunt,  all but one of our directors, and at least nine Berkshire managers\nregularly fly in the NetJets program.  Given that cargo, I applaud Rich’s insistence on unusually high amounts of\npilot training (an average of 23 days a year).  In addition, our pilots cement their skills by flying 800 or so hours a\nyear.  Finally, each flies only one model of aircraft, which means our crews do no switching around among planes\nwith different cockpit and flight characteristics.\nEJA’s business continues to be constrained by the availability of new aircraft.  Still, our custo mers will\ntake delivery of more than 50 new jets in 2001, 7% of world output.  We are confident we will remain the world\nleader in fractional ownership, in respect to number of planes flying, quality of service, and standards of safety.\n* * * * * * * * * *\nAdditional information about our various businesses is given on pages 42-58, where you will also find our\nsegment earnings reported on a GAAP basis.   In addition,  on pages 67-73, we have rearranged Berkshire’s financial\ndata into four segments on a non-GAAP basis, a presentation that corresponds to the way Charlie and I think about\nthe company.\nLook-Through Earnings\nReported earnings are an inadequate measure of economic progress at Berkshire, in part because the\nnumbers shown in the table on page 15 include only the dividends we receive from investees  though these\ndividends typically represent only a small fraction of the earnings attributable to our ownership.  To depict\nsomething closer to economic reality at Berkshire than reported earnings, though, we employ the concept of \"look-\nthrough\" earnings.  As we calculate these, they consist of: (1) the operating earnings reported on page 15; plus; (2)\nour share of the retained operating earnings of major investees that, under GAAP accounting, are not reflected in\nour profits, less; (3) an allowance for the tax that would be paid by Berkshire if these retained earnings of investees\nhad instead been distributed to us.  When tabulating \"operating earnings\" here, we exclude purchase-accounting\nadjustments as well as capital gains and other major non-recurring items.\nThe following table sets forth our 2000  look-through  earnings,  though I warn you that the figures can be no\nmore than approximate, since they are based on a number of judgment calls.  (The dividends paid to us by these\ninvestees have been included in the operating earnings itemized on page 15, mostly under \"Insurance Group:  Net\nInvestment Income.\")\n\n17Berkshire's Approximate Berkshire's Share of Undistributed\nBerkshire's Major Investees  Ownership at Yearend(1) Operating Earnings (in millions)(2)  \nAmerican Express Company ............................. 11.4% $265\nThe Coca-Cola Company ................................ ..   8.1%   160\nFreddie Mac ................................ .....................   0.3%   106\nThe Gillette Company ................................ .......   9.1%     51\nM&T Bank ................................ .......................   7.2%     23\nThe Washington Post Company ........................ 18.3%     18\nWells Fargo & Company ................................ ...   3.2%   117\nBerkshire's share of undistributed earnings of major investees 740\nHypothetical tax on these undistributed investee earnings(3)    (104)\nReported operating earnings of Berkshire  1,779  \n      Total look-through earnings of Berkshire $ 2,415   \n     (1) Does not include shares allocable to minority interests\n     (2) Calculated on average ownership for the year\n     (3) The tax rate used is 14%, which is the rate Berkshire pays on most dividends it receives\nFull and Fair Reporting \nAt Berkshire, full reporting means giving you the information that we would wish you to give to us if our\npositions were reversed.  What Charlie and I would want under that circumstance would be all the important facts\nabout current operations as well as the CEO’s frank view of the long-term economic characteristics of the business.\nWe would expect both a lot of financial details and a discussion of any significant data we would need to interpret\nwhat was presented.\nWhen Charlie and I read reports, we have no interest in pictures of personnel, plants or products.\nReferences to EBITDA make us shudder   does management think the tooth fairy pays for capital expenditures?\nWe’re very suspicious of accounting methodology that is vague or unclear, since too often that means management\nwishes to hide something.   And we don’t want to read messages that a public relations department or consultant has\nturned out.  Instead, we expect a company’s CEO to explain in his or her own words what’s happening.\nFor us, fair reporting means getting information to our 300,000 “partners” simultaneously, or as close to\nthat mark as possible.   We therefore put our annual and quarterly financials on the Internet between the close of the\nmarket on a Friday and the following morning.  By our doing that, shareholders and other interested investors have\ntimely access to these important releases and also have a reasonable amount of time to digest the information they\ninclude before the markets open on Monday.   This year our quarterly information will be available on the Saturdays\nof May 12, August 11, and November 10.  The 2001 annual report will be posted on March 9.\nWe applaud the work that Arthur Levitt, Jr., until recently Chairman of the SEC, has done in crackin g\ndown on the corporate practice of “selective disclosure” that had spread like cancer in recent years.  Indeed, it had\nbecome virtually standard practice for major corporations to “guide” analysts or large holders to earnings\nexpectations  that were intended either to be on the nose or a tiny bit below  what the company truly expected to earn.\nThrough the selectively dispersed hints, winks and nods that companies engaged in, speculatively-minded\ninstitutions and advisors were given an information edge over investment-oriented individuals.  This was corrupt\nbehavior, unfortunately embraced by both Wall Street and corporate America.\nThanks to Chairman Levitt, whose general efforts on behalf of investors were both tireless and effective,\ncorporations are now required to treat all of their owners equally.  The fact that this reform came about because of\ncoercion rather than conscience should be a matter of shame for CEOs and their investor relations departments.\n\n18One further thought while I’m on my soapbox: Cha rlie and I think it is both deceptive and dangerous for\nCEOs to predict growth rates for their companies.  They are, of course, frequently egged on to do so by both\nanalysts and their own investor relations departments.  They should resist, however, because too often these\npredictions lead to trouble.\nIt’s fine for a CEO to have his own internal goals and, in our view, it’s even appropriate for the CEO to\npublicly express some hopes about the future, if these expectations are accompanied by sensible caveats.  But for a\nmajor corporation  to predict that its per-share  earnings will grow  over the long term at,  say, 15%  annually is to court\ntrouble.\nThat’s true because a growth rate of that magnitude can only be maintained by a very small percentage of\nlarge businesses.  Here’s a test:  Examine the record of, say, the 200 highest earning companies from 1970 or 1980\nand tabulate how many have increased per-share earnings by 15% annually since those dates.  You will find that\nonly a handful have.  I would wager you a very significant sum that fewer than 10 of the 200 most profitable\ncompanies in 2000 will attain 15% annual growth in earnings-per-share over the next 20 years.\nThe problem arising from lofty predictions is not just that they spread unwarranted optim ism.  Even more\ntroublesome is the fact that they corrode CEO behavior.  Over the years, Charlie and I have observed many\ninstances in  which CEOs engaged in uneconomic  operating maneuvers  so that they could meet earnings targets they\nhad announced.  Worse still, after exhausting all that operating acrobatics would do, they sometimes played a wide\nvariety of accounting games to “make the numbers.” These accounting shenanigans have a way of snowballing:\nOnce a company moves earnings from one period to another, operating shortfalls that occur thereafter require it to\nengage in further accounting maneuvers that must be even more “heroic.”  These can turn fudging into fraud.\n(More money, it has been noted, has been stolen with the point of a pen than at the point of a gun.)\nCharlie and I tend to be leery of companies run by CEOs who woo investors with fancy predictions.   A few\nof these managers will prove prophetic — but others will turn out to be congenital optimists, or even charlatans.\nUnfortunately, it’s not easy for investors to know in advance which species they are dealing with.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nI’ve warned you in the past that you should not believe everything you read or hear about Berkshire \neven when it is published or broadcast by a prestigious news organization.  Indeed, erroneous reports are\nparticularly dangerous when they are circulated by highly-respected members of the media, simply because most\nreaders and listeners know these outlets to be generally credible and therefore believe what they say.\nAn example is a glaring error about Berkshire’s activities that appeared in the December 29 issue of The\nWall Street Journal , a generally excellent paper that I have for all of my life found useful.  On the front page (and\nabove the fold, as they say)  The Journal published a news brief that said, in unequivocal terms, that we were buying\nbonds of Conseco and Finova.  This item directed the reader to the lead story of the Money and Investing section.\nThere, in the second paragraph of the story, The Journal  reported, again without any qualification , that Berkshire\nwas buying Conseco and Finova bonds, adding that Berkshire had invested “several hundred million dollars” in\neach.  Only in the  18th paragraph  of the story (which by that point had jumped to an inside page) did the paper hedge\na bit, saying that our Conseco purchases had been disclosed by “people familiar with the matter.”\nWell, not that familiar.  True, we had purchased bonds and bank debt of Finova  though the report was\nwildly inaccurate as to the amount.  But to this day neither Berkshire nor I have ever bought a share of stock or a\nbond of Conseco.\nBerkshire is normally  covered  by a Journal reporter in Chicago who is both accurate and conscientious.  In\nthis case, however, the “scoop” was the product of a New York reporter for the paper.  Indeed, the 29th was a busy\nday for him:  By early afternoon, he had repeated the story on CNBC.   Immediately, in lemming-like manner, other\nrespected news organizations, relying solely on the Journal , began relating the same “facts.”  The result:  Conseco\nstock advanced sharply during the day on exceptional volume that placed it ninth on the NYSE most-active list.\nDuring all of the story’s iterations, I never heard or read the word “rumor.”  Appa rently reporters and\neditors, who generally pride themselves on their careful use of language, just can’t bring themselves to attach this\nword to their accounts.  But what description would fit more precisely?  Certainly not the usual “sources say” or “it\nhas been reported.”\n\n19A column entitled “Today’s Rumors,” however, would not equate with the self-image of the many news\norganizations that think themselves above such stuff.  These members of the media would feel that publishing such\nacknowledged fluff would be akin to L’Osservatore Romano  initiating a gossip column.  But rumors are what these\norganizations often publish and broadcast, whatever euphemism they duck behind.  At a minimum, readers deserve\nhonest terminology  a warning label that will protect their financial health in the same way that smokers whose\nphysical health is at risk are given a warning.\nThe Constitution’s First Amendment allows the media to print or say almost anything.  Journalism’s First\nPrinciple should require that the media be scrupulous in deciding what that will be.\nMiscellaneous\nIn last year’s report we examined the battle then raging over the use of “pooling” in accounting for\nmergers.  It seemed to us that both sides were voicing arguments that were strong in certain respects and seriously\nflawed in others.  We are pleased that the Financial Accounting Standards Board has since gone to an alternative\napproach that strikes us as very sound.\nIf the proposed rule becomes final, we will no longer incur a large annual charge fo r amortization of\nintangibles.  Consequently, our reported earnings will more closely reflect economic reality.  (See page 65.)  None\nof this will have an effect on Berkshire’s intrinsic value.  Your Chairman, however, will personally benefit in that\nthere will be one less item to explain in these letters.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nI’m enclosing a report  generously supplied by Outstanding Investor Digest  of Charlie’s remarks at\nlast May’s Wesco annual meeting.  Charlie thinks about business economics and investment matters better than\nanyone I know, and I’ve learned a lot over the years by listening to him.  Reading his comments will improve your\nunderstanding of Berkshire.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIn  1985, we purchased Scott Fetzer, acquiring not only a  fine business but the services of Ralph Schey, a\ntruly outstanding CEO, as well.  Ralph was then 61.  Most companies, focused on the calendar rather than ability,\nwould have benefited from Ralph’s talents for only a few years.\nAt Berkshire, in contrast, Ralph ran Scott Fetzer for  15 years until his retirement  at the end of 2000.  Under\nhis leadership, the company distributed $1.03 billion to Berkshire against our net purchase price of $230 million.\nWe used these funds, in turn, to purchase other businesses.  All told, Ralph’s contributions to Berkshire’s present\nvalue extend well into the billions of dollars.\nAs a manager, Ralph belongs in Berkshire’s Hall of Fame, and Charlie and I welcome him to it.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nA bit of nostalgia:  It was exactly 50 years ago that I entered Ben Graham’s class at Columbia.  During the\ndecade before, I had enjoyed  make that loved ¾ analyzing, buying and selling stocks.  But my results were no\nbetter than average.\nBeginning in 1951 my performance improved.  No, I hadn’t changed my diet or taken up exercise.  The\nonly new ingredient was Ben’s ideas.  Quite simply, a few hours spent at the feet of the master proved far more\nvaluable to me than had ten years of supposedly original thinking.\nIn addition to bein g a great teacher, Ben was a wonderful friend.  My debt to him is incalculable.\n\n20Shareholder-Designated Contributions\nAbout 97% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshire's 2000 shareholder-designated contributions\nprogram, with contributions totaling $16.9 million.  A full description of the program appears on pages 74-75.\nCumulatively, over the 20 years of the program, Berkshire has made contributions of $164 million\npursuant to the instructions of our shareholders.  The rest of Berkshire's giving is done by our subsidiaries, which\nstick to the philanthropic patterns that prevailed before they were acquired (except that their former owners\nthemselves take on the responsibility for their personal charities).   In aggregate, our subsidiaries made contributions\nof $18.3 million in 2000, including in-kind donations of $3 million.\nTo participate in future programs, you must own Class A shares that are registered in the name of the\nactual owner, not the nominee name of a broker, bank or depository.  Shares not so registered on August 31, 2001\nwill be ineligible for the 2001 program.  When you get the contributions form from us, return it promptly so that it\ndoes not get put aside or forgotten.  Designations received after the due date will not be honored.\nThe Annual Meeting\nLast year we moved the annual meeting to the Civic Auditorium, and it worked very well for us.  We will\nmeet there again on Saturday, April 28.   The doors will open at 7  a.m., the movie will begin  at 8:30, and the meeting\nitself will commence at 9:30.  There will be a short break at noon for food, with sandwiches available at the Civic’s\nconcession stands.  Except for that interlude, Charlie and I will answer questions until 3:30.\nFor the next couple of years, the Civic is our  only choice.  We must therefore hold the meeting on either\nSaturday or Sunday to avoid the traffic and parking nightmare that would occur on a weekday.  Shortly, however,\nOmaha will have a new Convention Center with ample parking.   Assuming that the Center is then available to us, I\nwill poll shareholders to see whether you wish to return to a Monday meeting.  We will decide that vote based on\nthe wishes of a majority of shareholders, not shares.\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with t his report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to this year’s meeting and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car\nreservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  In our normal\nfashion, we will run buses from the larger hotels to the meeting.  After the meeting, the buses will make trips back\nto the hotels and to Nebraska Furniture Mart, Borsheim’s and the airport.  Even so, you are likely to find a car\nuseful.\nWe have ad ded so many new companies to Berkshire this year that I’m not going to detail all of the\nproducts that we will be selling at the meeting.  But come prepared to carry home everything from bricks to candy.\nOne new product, however, deserves special note:  Bob Shaw has designed a 3 x 5 rug featuring an excellent\nlikeness of Charlie.  Obviously, it would be embarrassing for Charlie  make that humiliating  if slow sales\nforced us to slash the rug’s price, so step up and do your part.\nGEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of them\nready to supply you with auto insurance quotes.  In most cases, GEICO will be able to offer you a special\nshareholder’s discount (usually 8%).   Bring the details  of your existing insurance and check out whether we can\nsave you some money.\nAt the Omaha airport on Saturday, we will have the usual array of aircraft from Executive Jet available for\nyour inspection.  Just ask an EJA representative at the Civic about viewing any of these planes.  If you buy what we\nconsider an appropriate number of items during the weekend, you may well need your own plane to take them\nhome.\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 75-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will\nagain be having “Berkshire Weekend” pricing, which means we will be offering our shareholders a discount that is\ncustomarily given only to employees.  We initiated this special pricing at NFM four years ago and sales during the\n“Weekend” grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $9.1 million in 2000.\n\n21To get the discount, you must make your purchases between Wednesday, April 25 and Monday, April 30\nand also present your meeting credential.  The period’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several\nprestige  manufacturers  that normally  have ironclad  rules against discounting but that, in the spirit of our shareholder\nweekend, have made an exception for you.  We appreciate their cooperation.  NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.\non weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.\nBorsheim’s  the largest jewelry store in the country except for Tiffany’s Manhattan store  will have\ntwo shareholder-only events.  The first will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, April 27.  The\nsecond, the main gala, will be from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday, April 29.  Shareholder prices will be available\nThursday through Monday, so if you wish to avoid the large crowds that will assemble on Friday evening and\nSunday, come at other times and identify yourself as a shareholder.  On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m.\nBorsheim’s operates on a gross margin that is fully twenty percentage points below that of its major rivals, so the\nmore you buy, the more you save (or at least that’s what my family always tells me).\nIn the mall outside of Borsheim’s, we will have local bridge experts available to play with our shareholders\non Sunday.  Bob Hamman, who normally is with us, will be in Africa this year.   He has promised,  however, to be on\nhand in 2002.  Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, will also be in the mall, taking on all comers \nblindfolded!  Last year, Patrick played as many as six games simultaneously  with his blindfold securely in place\n and demolished his opponents.\nAs if all this isn’t en ough to test your skills, our Borsheim’s Olympiad this year will also include Bill\nRobertie, one of only two players to twice win the backgammon world championship.  Backgammon can be a big\nmoney game, so bring along your stock certificates.\nGorat’s  my favorite  steakhouse  will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday,\nApril 29, and will be serving from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  Please remember that you can’t come to Gorat’s on Sunday\nwithout a reservation.  To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 2 ( but not before ).  If Sunday is sold out, try\nGorat’s on one of the other evenings you will be in town.  If you order a rare T-bone with a double order of hash\nbrowns, you will establish your credentials as an epicure.\nThe usual baseball ga me will be held at Rosenblatt Stadium at 7 p.m. on Saturday night.  This year the\nOmaha Golden Spikes will play the New Orleans Zephyrs.  Ernie Banks is again going to be on hand to  bravely\n face my fastball (once clocked at 95 mpm  miles per month).\nMy performance last year was not my best:  It took me five pitches to throw anything resembling a strike.\nAnd, believe me, it gets lonely on the mound when you can’t find the plate.  Finally, I got one over, and Ernie\nlashed a line drive to left field.   After I was yanked from the game, the many sports writers present asked what I had\nserved up to Ernie.  I quoted what Warren Spahn said after Willie Mays hit one of his pitches for a home run\n(Willie’s first in the majors):  “It was a helluva pitch for the first sixty feet.”\nIt will be a different story this year.  I don’t want to tip my hand, so let’s just say Ernie will have to deal\nwith a pitch he has never seen before.\nOur proxy statement contains instructions about obtaining tickets to the game and al so a large quantity of\nother information that should help you enjoy your visit in Omaha.  There will be plenty of action in town.  So come\nfor Woodstock Weekend and join our Celebration of Capitalism at the Civic.\nWarren E. Buffett\nFebruary 28, 2001 Chairman of the Board",

In th is table, Berkshire's results\nthrough 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rule s.  In all other respects, the results are calculated using\nthe numbers originally reported.\nThe S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax  whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax .  If a corporation such as Berkshire\nwere simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appr opriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500\nin years when that index showed a pos itive return, but would have exceeded the S&P in years when the index showed a\nnegative return.  Over the years, the tax costs woul d have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n\n3BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshires loss in net worth during 2001 was $3.77 billion, which decreased the per-share book value of\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 6.2%.  Over the la st 37 years (that is, since present management took over)\nper-share book value has grown from $19 to $37, 920, a rate of 22.6% compounded annually.∗\nPer-share intrinsic grew somewhat faster than book value during these 37 years, and in 2001 it probably\ndecreased a bit less.  We explain intr insic value in our Owners Manual, wh ich begins on page 62.  I urge new\nshareholders to read this manual to become fa miliar with Berkshires key economic principles.\nTwo years ago, reporting on 1999, I said that we ha d experienced both the worst absolute and relative\nperformance in our history.  I added th at relative results are what concern us, a viewpoint Ive had since forming\nmy first investment partnership on May 5, 1956.  Meeting with my seven founding limited partners that evening, I\ngave them a short paper titled The Ground Rules that included this sentence: Whether we do a good job or a\npoor job is to be measured against the general experience in securities.  We initially used the Dow Jones Industrials\nas our benchmark, but shifted to the S&P 500 when that index became widely used.  Our comparative record since\n1965 is chronicled on the facing page; last year Berkshires advantage was 5.7 percentage points.\nSome people disagree with our focus on relative figur es, arguing that you cant eat relative performance.\nBut if you expect  as Charlie Munger, Berkshires Vice Chairman, and I do  that owning the S&P 500 willproduce reasonably satisfactory results over time, it follows that, for long-term investors, gaining small advantages\nannually over that index must  prove rewarding.  Just as you can eat well throughout the year if you own a profitable,\nbut highly seasonal, business such as Sees (which lose s considerable money during the summer months) so, too,\ncan you regularly feast on investment returns that beat th e averages, however variable the absolute numbers may be.\nThough our corporate performance last year was satisfactory, my performance was anything but.  I manage\nmost of Berkshires equity portfolio, and my results were poor, just as they have been for several years.  Of even\nmore importance, I allowed General Re to take on bus iness without a safeguard I knew was important, and on\nSeptember 11\nth, this error caught up with us.  Ill tell you more about my mistake later and what we are doing to\ncorrect it.\nAnother of my 1956 Ground Rules remains applicable: I cannot promise results to partners.  But Charlie\nand I can promise that your economic result from Berkshire w ill parallel ours during the pe riod of your ownership:\nWe will not take cash compensation, restricted stock or option grants that would make our results superior to yours.\nAdditionally, I will keep well over 99% of my net worth in Berkshire.  My wife and I have never sold a\nshare nor do we intend to.  Charlie and I are disgusted by the situation, so common in the last few years, in whichshareholders have suffered billions in losses while the CEOs, promoters, and other higher-ups who fathered thesedisasters have walked away with extraordinary wealth.  Indeed, many of these people were urging investors to buyshares while concurrently dumping their own, sometimes using methods that hid their actions. To their shame, thesebusiness leaders view shareholders as patsies, not partners.\nThough Enron has become the symbol for shareholder abuse, there is no shortage of egregious conduct\nelsewhere in corporate America.  One story Ive heard illustrates the all-too-common attitude of managers toward\n                                                          \n∗All figures used in this report apply to Berkshire's A shares, the successor to the only stock that the\ncompany had outstanding before 1996.  The B shares have an ec onomic interest equal to 1/30th that of the A.\n\n4owners: A gorgeous woman slinks up to a CEO at a party and through moist lips purrs, Ill do anything  anything\n you want.  Just tell me what you would like.  With no hesitation, he replies, Reprice my options.\nOne final thought about Berkshire: In the future we wont come close to replicating our past record.  To be\nsure, Charlie and I will strive for above -average performance and will not be sa tisfied with less.  But two conditions\nat Berkshire are far different from what they once were: Then, we could often buy businesses and securities at muchlower valuations than now prevail; and more important, we were then working with far less money than we nowhave.  Some years back, a good $10 million idea could do w onders for us (witness our investment in Washington\nPost in 1973 or GEICO in 1976).  Today, the combination of ten such ideas and a triple in the value of each  would\nincrease the net worth of Berkshire by only ¼ of 1%.  We need elephants to make significant gains now  andthey are hard to find.\nOn the positive side, we have as fine an array of operating managers as exists at any company.  (You can\nread about many of them in a new book by Robert P. Miles: The Warren Buffett CEO .) In large part, moreover, they\nare running businesses with economic characteristics rangi ng from good to superb.  The ability, energy and loyalty\nof these managers is simply extraordinary.  We now have completed 37 Berkshire years without having a CEO ofan operating business elect to leave us to work elsewhere.\nOur star-studded group grew in 2001.  First, we comp leted the purchases of two businesses that we had\nagreed to buy in 2000  Shaw and Johns Manville.  Then we acquired two othe rs, MiTek and XTRA, and\ncontracted to buy two more: Larson-Juhl, an acquisition that has just closed, and Fruit of the Loom, which will closeshortly if creditors approve our offer.  All of these bus inesses are led by smart, seasoned and trustworthy CEOs.\nAdditionally, all of our purchases last year were fo r cash, which means our shareholders became owners of\nthese additional businesses without relinquishing any interest in the fine companies they already owned.  We willcontinue to follow our familiar formula, striving to increase the value of the excellent businesses we have, addingnew businesses of similar quality, and issuing shares only grudgingly.\nAcquisitions of 2001\nA few days before last years a nnual meeting, I received a heavy p ackage from St. Louis, containing an\nunprepossessing chunk of metal whose function I couldnt imagine. There was a letter in the package, though, fromGene Toombs, CEO of a company called MiTek.  He explained that MiTek is the worlds leading producer of thisthing Id received, a connector plate, wh ich is used in making roofing trusses.  Gene also said that the U.K. parent\nof MiTek wished to sell the company and that Berkshire seemed to him the ideal buyer.  Liking the sound of hisletter, I gave Gene a call.  It took me only a minute to realize that he was our kind of manager and MiTek our kind\nof business.  We made a cash offer to the U.K. owner and before long had a deal.\nGenes managerial crew is exceptionally enthusiastic about the company and wanted to participate in the\npurchase.  Therefore, we arranged for 55 members of the MiTek team to buy 10% of the company, with each\nputting up a minimum of $100,000 in cash.  Many borrowed money so they could participate.\nAs they would not be if they had options, all of these managers are true owners .  They face the downside of\ndecisions as well as the upside.  They incur a cost of capital.  And they cant  reprice their stakes: What they paid\nis what they live with.\nCharlie and I love the high-grade, truly entrepreneurial attitude that exists at MiTek, and we predict it will\nbe a winner for all involved.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIn early 2000, my friend, Julian Robertson, announced th at he would terminate his investment partnership,\nTiger Fund, and that he would liquidate it entirely except for four large holdings.  One of these was XTRA, aleading lessor of truck trailers.  I then called Julian, asking whether he might consider selling his XTRA block or\nwhether, for that matter, the companys management mi ght entertain an offer for the entire company.  Julian\nreferred me to Lew Rubin, XTRAs CEO.  He and I had a nice conversation, but it was apparent that no deal was to\nbe done.\nThen in June 2001, Julian called to say that he ha d decided to sell his XTRA shares, and I resumed\nconversations with Lew.  The XTRA board accepted a pr oposal we made, which was to  be effectuated through a\ntender offer expiring on September 11\nth.  The tender conditions included the usua l out, allowing us to withdraw if\n\n5the stock market were to close before the offers expiration.  Throughout much of the 11th, Lew went through a\nparticularly wrenching experience: First, he had a son-in-law working in the World Trade Center who couldnt belocated; and second, he knew we had the option of back ing away from our purchase.  The story ended happily:\nLews son-in-law escaped serious harm, and Berkshire completed the transaction.\nTrailer leasing is a cyclical busin ess but one in which we should earn decent returns over time.  Lew brings\na new talent to Berkshire, and we hope to expand in leasing.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nOn December 3\nrd, I received a call from Craig Ponzio, owner of  Larson-Juhl, the U.S. leader in custom-\nmade picture frames.  Craig had bought the company in 1981 (after first working at its manufacturing plant whileattending college) and thereafter increased its sales fro m $3 million to $300 million.  Though I had never heard of\nLarson-Juhl before Craigs call, a few minutes talk with  him made me think we would strike a deal.  He was\nstraightforward in describing the business, cared about who bought it, and was realistic as to price.  Two days later,\nCraig and Steve McKenzie, his CEO, came to Omaha and in ninety minutes we reached an  agreement.  In ten days\nwe had signed a contract.\nLarson-Juhl serves about 18,000 framing shops in the U.S.  and is also the industry leader in Canada and\nmuch of Europe.  We expect to see opportunities fo r making complementary acquisitions in the future.\n* * * * * * * * * * *\nAs I write this letter, creditors are considering an offer we have made for Fruit of the Loom.  The company\nentered bankruptcy a few years back, a victim both of too much debt and poor management.  And, a good many\nyears before that, I had some Fruit of the Loom experience of my own.\nIn August 1955, I was one of five employees, including two secretaries, working for the three managers of\nGraham-Newman Corporation, a New York investment company.  Graham-Newman controlled Philadelphia andReading Coal and Iron (P&R), an anthracite producer  that had excess cash, a tax loss carryforward, and a\ndeclining business.  At the time, I had a significant portion of my limited net worth invested in P&R shares,reflecting my faith in the business talents of my bosses,  Ben Graham, Jerry Newman and Howard (Micky) Newman.\nThis faith was rewarded when P& R purchased the Union Underwear Co mpany from Jack Goldfarb for $15\nmillion.  Union (though it was then only a licensee of th e name) produced Fruit of the Loom underwear.  The\ncompany possessed $5 million in cash  $2.5 million of wh ich P&R used for the purchase  and was earning about\n$3 million pre-tax, earnings that could be sheltered by the tax position of P&R.  And, oh yes: Fully $9 million of theremaining $12.5 million due was satisfied  by non-interest-bearing notes, paya ble from 50% of any earnings Union\nhad in excess of $1 million.  ( Those  were the days; I get goosebumps just thinking about such deals.)\nSubsequently, Union bought the licensor of the Fruit of the Loom name and, along with P&R, was merged\ninto Northwest Industries.  Fruit went on to achieve annual pre-tax earnings exceeding $200 million.\nJohn Holland was responsible for Fruits operations in  its most bountiful years.  In 1996, however, John\nretired, and management loaded the co mpany with debt, in part to make a series of acquisitions that proved\ndisappointing.  Bankruptcy followed.  John was then re hired, and he undertook a majo r reworking of operations.\nBefore Johns return, deliveries were chaotic, costs soared  and relations with key customers deteriorated.  While\ncorrecting these problems, John also reduced employment from a bloated 40,000 to 23,000.  In short, hes beenrestoring the old Fruit of the Loom, albeit in a much more competitive environment.\nStepping into Fruits bankruptcy pro ceedings, we made a proposal to cr editors to which we attached no\nfinancing conditions, even though our offer had to remain out standing for many months.  We did, however, insist on\na very unusual proviso: John had to be available to conti nue serving as CEO after we took over.  To us, John and\nthe brand are Fruits key assets.\nI was helped in this transaction by my friend and former boss, Micky Newman, now 81.  What goes around\ntruly does come around.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n6Our operating companies made several bolt-on acquis itions during the year, and I cant resist telling you\nabout one.  In December, Frank Rooney called to tell me H.H. Brown was buying the i nventory and trademarks of\nAcme Boot for $700,000.\nThat sounds like small potatoes.  But  would you believe it?  Acme was the second purchase of P&R, an\nacquisition that took place just  before I left Graham-Newman in the spring of 1956.  The price was $3.2 million,\npart of it again paid with non-interest beari ng notes, for a business with sales of $7 million.\nAfter P&R merged with Northwest, Acme grew to be the worlds largest bootmaker, delivering annual\nprofits many multiples of what the company had cost P&R.  But the business eventually hit the skids and neverrecovered, and that resulted in our purchasing Acmes remnants.\nIn the frontispiece to Security Analysis , Ben Graham and Dave Dodd quoted Horace: Many shall be\nrestored that now are fallen and many shall fall that are now in honor.  Fifty-two years after I first read those lines,my appreciation for what they say about bus iness and investments continues to grow.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIn addition to bolt-on acquisitions, our managers conti nually look for ways to grow internally.  In that\nregard, heres a postscript to a story I told you two year s ago about R.C. Willeys move to Boise.  As you may\nremember, Bill Child, R.C. Willeys ch airman, wanted to extend his home -furnishings operati on beyond Utah, a\nstate in which his company does more than $300 milli on of business (up, it should be noted, from $250,000 when\nBill took over 48 years ago).  The company achieved this  dominant position, moreover, with a closed on Sunday\npolicy that defied conventional retailing wisdom.  I was skeptical that this po licy could succeed in Boise or, for that\nmatter, anyplace outside of Utah.  After all, S unday is the day many consumers most like to shop.\nBill then insisted on something extr aordinary: He would invest $11 milli on of his own money to build the\nBoise store and would sell it to Berkshir e at cost (without interest!) if the ve nture succeeded.  If it failed, Bill would\nkeep the store and eat the loss on its disposal.  As I told you in the 1999 annual report, the store immediatelybecame a huge success ― and it has since grown.\nShortly after the Boise opening, Bill suggested we try Las Vegas, and this time I was even more skeptical.\nHow could we do business in a metropolis of that size and be closed on Sundays, a day that all of our competitors\nwould be exploiting?  Buoy ed by the Boise experience, however, we  proceeded to locate in Henderson, a\nmushrooming city adjacent to Las Vegas.\nThe result: This store outsells all others in the R.C. Willey chain, doing a volume of business that far\nexceeds the volume of any competitor and that is twice what I had anticipated .  I cut the ribbon at the grand opening\nin October  this was after a soft opening and a few week s of exceptional sales  and, just as I did at Boise, I\nsuggested to the crowd that the new store was my idea.\nIt didnt work.  Today, when I pontificate about retailing, Berkshir e people just say, What does Bill\nthink?  (Im going to draw the line, however, if he suggests that we also close on Saturdays.)\nThe Economics of Property/Casualty Insurance\nOur main business  though we have others of great importance  is insurance.  To understand\nBerkshire, therefore, it is necessary that you understa nd how to evaluate an insurance company.  The key\ndeterminants are: (1) the amount of floa t that the business generates; (2) its co st; and (3) most critical of all, the\nlong-term outlook for both of these factors.\nTo begin with, float is money we hold but don't own.  In an insura nce operation, float arises because\npremiums are received before losses ar e paid, an interval that sometimes extends over many years.  During that\ntime, the insurer invests the money.  This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside: The premiums thatan insurer takes in usually do not cover the losses and expe nses it eventually must pay.  That leaves it running an\n\"underwriting loss,\" which is the cost of float.  An insurance business has value if its cost of float over time is less\nthan the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain funds.  But the business is a lemon if its cost of float ishigher than market rates for money.\n\n7Historically, Berkshire has obtained its float at a very low cost.  Indeed, our cost  has been less than zero in\nabout half of the years in which weve operated; that is , weve actually been paid for holding other peoples money.\nOver the last few years, however, our cost has been too high, and in 2001 it was terrible.\nThe table that follows shows (at intervals) the float generated by the various segments of Berkshires\ninsurance operations since we entered the business 35 years ago upon acquiring National Indemnity Company\n(whose traditional lines are included in the segment Other Pr imary).  For the table we have calculated our float \nwhich we generate in large amounts relative to our prem ium volume  by adding net loss reserves, loss adjustment\nreserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unear ned premium reserves, and then subtracting insurance-\nrelated receivables, prepaid ac quisition costs, prepaid taxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance.\n(Got that?)\nYearend Float (in $ millions)\nOther Other\nYear GEICO General Re Reinsurance Primary Total\n1967 20 201977 40 131 1711987 701 807 1,5081997 2,917 4,014 455 7,3861998 3,125 14,909 4,305 415 22,7541999 3,444 15,166 6,285 403 25,2982000 3,943 15,525 7,805 598 27,8712001 4,251 19,310 11,262 685 35,508\nLast year I told you that, barring a mega-catastrophe, our cost of float would probably drop from its 2000\nlevel of 6%.  I had in mind natural catastrophes when I said  that, but instead we were hit by a man-made catastrophe\non September 11\nth  an event that delivered the insurance industry its largest loss in history.  Our float cost therefore\ncame in at a staggering 12.8%.  It was our worst year in float cost since 1984, and a result that to a significantdegree, as I will explain in the ne xt section, we brought upon ourselves.\nIf no mega-catastrophe occurs, I  once again  expect the cost of our float to be low in the coming year.\nWe will indeed need a low cost, as will all insurers.  Some years back, float co sting, say, 4% was tolerable because\ngovernment bonds yielded twice as much, a nd stocks prospectively offered still lo ftier returns.  Today, fat returns\nare nowhere to be found (at least we cant find them) and short-term funds earn less than 2%.  Under these\nconditions, each of our insurance operati ons, save one, must deliver an underwriting profit if it is to be judged a\ngood business.  The exception is our retroactive reinsurance operation (a business we explai ned in last years annual\nreport), which has desirable economics even though it currently hits us with  an annual underwriting loss of about\n$425 million.\nPrinciples of Insurance Underwriting\nWhen property/casualty companies are judged by their cost of float, very few stack up as satisfactory\nbusinesses.  And interestingly  unlike the situation prev ailing in many other industries  neither size nor brand\nname determines an insurers prof itability.  Indeed, many of the bigge st and best-known companies regularly\ndeliver mediocre results.  What counts in this busine ss is underwriting discipline.  The winners are those that\nunfailingly stick to three key principles:\n1. They accept only those risks that they are able to properly evaluate (staying within their circle of\ncompetence) and that, after they have evaluated all relevant factors including remote lossscenarios, carry the expectancy of  profit.  These insurers ignore market-share considerations and\nare sanguine about losing business to competitors that are offering foolish prices or policy\nconditions.\n2. They limit the business they accep t in a manner that guarantees they will suffer no aggregation of\nlosses from a single event or from related events  that will threaten their solvency.  They\nceaselessly search for possible correlation among seemingly-unrelated risks.\n\n83. They avoid business involving moral risk: No matter what the rate, trying to write good contracts\nwith bad people doesn’t work.  While most policyholders and clients are honorable and ethical,doing business with the few exceptions is usua lly expensive, sometimes extraordinarily so.\nThe events of September 11\nth made it clear that our implementation of rules 1 and 2 at General Re had been\ndangerously weak.  In setting prices and also in evaluati ng aggregation risk, we had either overlooked or dismissed\nthe possibility of large-scale terrori sm losses.  That was a relevant underwriting factor, and we ignored it.\nIn pricing property coverages, for example, we had looked to the past  and taken into account only costs we\nmight expect to incur from windstorm, fi re, explosion and earthquake.  But what  will be the largest insured property\nloss in history (after adding related business-interruption claims) originated from none of these forces.  In short, allof us in the industry made a fundamental underwriting mi stake by focusing on experien ce, rather than exposure,\nthereby assuming a huge terrorism risk  for which we received no premium.\nExperience, of course, is a highly us eful starting point in underwriting most coverages.  For example, its\nimportant for insurers writing California earthquake policies to know how many quakes in the state during the pastcentury have registered 6.0 or greater on the Richter scale.  This information will not tell you the exact probabilityof a big quake next year, or where in the state it might ha ppen.  But the statistic has utility, particularly if you are\nwriting a huge statewide policy, as Nati onal Indemnity has done in recent years.\nAt certain times, however, using experience as a guide to pricing is not only useless, but actually\ndangerous.  Late in a bull market, for example, large losses from directors and officers liability insurance (D&O)are likely to be relatively rare.  When stocks are rising, th ere are a scarcity of targets to sue, and both questionable\naccounting and management chicanery often go undetected.  At that juncture, experience on high-limit D&O may\nlook great.\nBut thats just when exposure  is likely to be exploding, by way of ridiculous public offerings, earnings\nmanipulation, chain-letter-like stock promotions and a potpourri of other unsavory activities.  When stocks fall,these sins surface, hammering investors with losses that can run into the hundreds of billions.  Juries deciding\nwhether those losses should be borne by small investors or big insurance companies can be expected to hit insurers\nwith verdicts that bear little relation to those delivered in bu ll-market days.  Even one jumbo judgment, moreover,\ncan cause settlement costs in later cases to mushroom.  Consequently, the correct rate for D&O excess (meaningthe insurer or reinsurer will pay losses above  a high threshold) might well, if based on exposure , be five or more\ntimes the premium dictated by experience .\nInsurers have always found it costly to ignore new exposures.  Doing that in the case of terrorism,\nhowever, could literally bankrupt the i ndustry.  No one knows the probability of a nuclear detonation in a major\nmetropolis this year (or even multiple detonations, given that a terrorist organization able to construct one bombmight not stop there).  Nor can anyone, with assurance, assess the probability in this year, or another, of deadlybiological or chemical agents bei ng introduced simultaneously (say, thr ough ventilation systems) into multiple\noffice buildings and manufacturing plants.  An attack like that would produce astronomical workers compensationclaims.\nHeres what we do know:\n(a) The probability of such mind-boggling disasters, though likely very low at present, is not zero.\n(b) The probabilities are increasing, in an irregular and immeasur able manner, as knowledge and\nmaterials become available to those who wish us  ill.  Fear may recede w ith time, but the danger\nwont  the war against terrorism can never be won.  The best the nation can achieve is a longsuccession of stalemates.  There can be no checkmate against hydra-headed foes.\n(c) Until now, insurers and reinsurers have blithely assumed the financial consequences from the\nincalculable risks I have described.\n(d) Under a close-to-worst-case scenario, which c ould conceivably involve  $1 trillion of damage,\nthe insurance industry would be destroyed unless it manages in some manner to dramatically limitits assumption of terrorism risks.  Only the U.S.  Government has the resources to absorb such a\nblow.  If it is unwilling to do so on a prospective basis, the general citizenry must bear its ownrisks and count on the Government to come to its rescue after a disaster occurs.\n\n9Why, you might ask, didnt I recognize the above facts before September 11th?  The answer, sadly, is that I\ndid  but I didnt convert thought into action.  I violated the Noah rule: Predicting rain doesnt count; building arksdoes.  I consequently let Berkshire operate with a dangerous level of risk  at General Re in particular.  Im sorry to\nsay that much risk for which we havent been compensated remains on our books, but it is running off by the day.\nAt Berkshire, it should be noted, we have for some y ears been willing to assume more risk than any other\ninsurer has knowingly  taken on.  Thats still the case.  We are perfectly willing to lose $2 billion to $2½ billion in a\nsingle event (as we did on September 11\nth) if we have been paid properly for assuming the risk that caused the loss\n(which on that occasion we werent).\nIndeed, we have a major competitive advantage because  of our tolerance for huge losses.  Berkshire has\nmassive liquid resources, substantial non-insurance earnings, a favorable tax position and a knowledgeable\nshareholder constituency willing to accep t volatility in earnings.  This unique combination enables us to assume\nrisks that far exceed the appetite of ev en our largest competitors.  Over tim e, insuring these jumbo risks should be\nprofitable, though periodically they  will bring on a terrible year.\nThe bottom-line today is that we w ill write some coverage for terrori st-related losses, including a few non-\ncorrelated policies with very large limits.  But we w ill not knowingly expose Berkshir e to losses beyond what we\ncan comfortably handle.  We will control our to tal exposure, no matter what the competition does.\nInsurance Operations in 2001\nOver the years, our insurance business has provided ev er-growing, low-cost funds that have fueled much\nof Berkshires growth.  Charlie and I believe this will continue to be the case.  But we stumbled in a big way in2001, largely because of underwriting losses at General Re.\nIn the past I have assured you th at General Re was underwriting with discipline  and I have been proven\nwrong.  Though its managers intentions were good, the co mpany broke each of the three underwriting rules I set\nforth in the last section and has paid a huge price for doi ng so.  One obvious cause for its failure is that it did not\nreserve correctly  more about this in the next section  and therefore severely miscalculated the cost of the product\nit was selling.  Not knowing your costs will cause problems in  any business.  In long-ta il reinsurance, where years\nof unawareness will promote and pr olong severe underpricing,  ignorance of true costs is dynamite.\nAdditionally, General Re was overly-competitive in going after, and retaining, business.  While all\nconcerned may intend to underwrite with care, it is nonetheless difficult for able, hard-driving professionals to curbtheir urge to prevail over competitors.  If winning, however, is equated with market share rather than profits,trouble awaits.  No must be an important part of any underwriters vocabulary.\nAt the risk of sounding Pollyannaish,  I now assure you that underwriti ng discipline is being restored at\nGeneral Re (and its Cologne Re subsidiary) with appropr iate urgency.  Joe Brandon was appointed General Res\nCEO in September and, along with Tad Montross, its new president, is committed to producing underwriting\nprofits.  Last fall, Charlie and I read Jack Welchs terrific book, Jack, Straight from the Gut  (get a copy!).  In\ndiscussing it, we agreed that Joe has ma ny of Jacks characteristics: He is smart, energetic, hands-on, and expects\nmuch of both himself and his organization.\nWhen it was an independent company, General Re often shone, and now it also has the considerable\nstrengths Berkshire brings to the ta ble.  With that added advantage a nd with underwriting discipline restored,\nGeneral Re should be a huge asset for Berkshire.   I predict that Joe and Tad will make it so.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAt the National Indemnity reinsurance operation, Ajit Ja in continues to add enormous value to Berkshire.\nWorking with only 18 associates, Ajit manages one of th e worlds largest reinsurance operations measured by\nassets, and the largest, based upon the size of individual risks assumed.\nI have known the details of almost every policy that  Ajit has written since he came with us in 1986, and\nnever on even a single occasion have I seen him break any of our three unde rwriting rules.  His extraordinary\ndiscipline, of course, does not eliminate losses; it does, however, prevent foolish losses.  And thats the key: Just asis the case in investing, insurers produce outstanding long-term results primarily by avoiding dumb decisions, ratherthan by making brilliant ones.\n\n10Since September 11th, Ajit has been particularly busy.  Among the policies we have written and retained\nentirely for our own account are (1) $578 million of property coverage for a South Amer ican refinery once a loss\nthere exceeds $1 billion; (2) $1 billion of  non-cancelable third-part y liability coverage for losses arising from acts of\nterrorism at several large internati onal airlines; (3) £500 million of propert y coverage on a large North Sea oil\nplatform, covering losses from terrorism and sabotage, above £600 million th at the insured retained or reinsured\nelsewhere; and (4) significant coverage on the Sears Tower, including losses caused by terrorism, above a $500\nmillion threshold.  We have written ma ny other jumbo risks as well, such as protection for the World Cup Soccer\nTournament and the 2002 Winter Olympics.  In all cases , however, we have attempte d to avoid writing groups of\npolicies from which losses might seriously aggregate.  We will not, for example, write coverages on a large numberof office and apartment towers in a single metropolis without excluding losses from both a nuclear explosion andthe fires that would follow it.\nNo one can match the speed with which Ajit can offer huge policies.  After September 11\nth, his quickness\nto respond, always important, has become a major compe titive advantage.  So, too, has our unsurpassed financial\nstrength.  Some reinsurers  particular ly those who, in turn, are accustomed to  laying off much of their business on a\nsecond layer of reinsurers known as retrocessionaires  are in a weakened condition and would have difficulty\nsurviving a second mega-cat.  When a daisy chain of retrocessionaires exists, a single weak link can pose trouble forall.  In assessing the soundness of their reinsurance protection, insurers must therefore apply a stress test to allparticipants in the chain, and must contemplate a catastrophe loss occurring during a very unfavorable economicenvironment.  After all, you only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.  At Berkshire, we retainour risks and depend on no one.  And whatever the worlds problems, our checks will clear.\nAjits business will ebb and flow  but his underwriti ng principles wont waver.  Its impossible to\noverstate his value to Berkshire.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nGEICO, by far our largest primary insurer, made ma jor progress in 2001, thanks to Tony Nicely, its CEO,\nand his associates.  Quite simply, Tony is an owners dream.\nGEICOs premium volume grew 6.6% last year , its float grew $308 million, and it achieved an\nunderwriting profit of $221 million.  This means we were actually paid that amount la st year to hold the $4.25\nbillion in float, which of course doesnt belong to Berkshire but can be used by us for investment.\nThe only disappointment at  GEICO in 2001  and its an important one  was our inability to add\npolicyholders.  Our preferred customers (81% of our total)  grew by 1.6% but our sta ndard and non-standard policies\nfell by 10.1%.  Overall, policies in force fell .8%.\nNew business has improved in recent months.  Our clos ure rate from telephone inquiries has climbed, and\nour Internet business continues its steady growth.  We, therefore, expect at least a modest gain in policy countduring 2002.  Tony and I are eager to commit much more to marketing than the $219 million we spent last year, but\nat the moment we cannot see how to do so effectively.  In the meantime, our operating costs are low and far belowthose of our major competitors; our prices are a ttractive; and our float is cost-free and growing.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nOur other primary insurers delivered their usual fine  results last year.  These operations, run by Rod\nEldred, John Kizer, Tom Nerney, Michael Stearns, Don Towle and Don Wurster had combined premium volume of$579 million, up 40% over 2000.  Their float increased 14.5%  to $685 million, and they recorded an underwriting\nprofit of $30 million.  In aggregate, these companies are one  of the finest insurance ope rations in the country, and\ntheir 2002 prospects look excellent.\n “Loss Development” and Insurance Accounting\nBad terminology is the enemy of good thinking.  When companies or investment professionals use terms\nsuch as EBITDA and pro forma, they want you to  unthinkingly accept concepts th at are dangerously flawed.\n(In golf, my score is frequently below par on a pro forma  basis: I have firm plans to restructure my putting stroke\nand therefore only count the swings I take before reaching the green.)\n\n11In insurance reporting, loss development is a widely used term  and one that is seriously misleading.\nFirst, a definition: Loss reserves at an insurer are not funds tucked away for a rainy day, but rather a liability\naccount.  If properly calculated, the liability states the amount that an insure r will have to pay for all losses\n(including associated costs) that have occurred prior to  the reporting date but have not yet been paid.  When\ncalculating the reserve, the insurer will have been notified of many of the losses it is destined to pay, but others willnot yet have been reported to it.  These losses are called IBNR, for incurred but not reported.  Indeed, in some cases(involving, say, product liability or emb ezzlement) the insured itself will not ye t be aware that a loss has occurred.\nIts clearly difficult for an insurer to put a figure on the ultimate cost of all such reported and unreported\nevents.  But the ability to do so with reasonable accuracy is vital.  Otherwise the insurers managers wont know\nwhat its actual loss costs are and how these compare to the premiums being charged.  GEICO got into huge troublein the early 1970s because for several years it severely underreserved, and therefore believed its product (insurance\nprotection) was costing considerably less than was truly the case.  Consequently, the company sailed blissfullyalong, underpricing its product a nd selling more and more polic ies at ever-larger losses.\nWhen it becomes eviden t that reserves at past reporting dates unde rstated the liability that truly existed at\nthe time, companies speak of loss de velopment.  In the year discovered, these shortfalls penalize reported\nearnings because the catch-up costs from prior years must be added to current-year costs when results are\ncalculated.  This is what happened at General Re in 2001: a staggering $800 million of loss costs that actually\noccurred in earlier years, but that were not then recorded , were belatedly recognized last year and charged against\ncurrent earnings.  The mistake was an honest one, I can assu re you of that.  Nevertheless, for several years, this\nunderreserving caused us to believe that our  costs were much lower than they tr uly were, an error that contributed to\nwoefully inadequate pricing.  Additionally, the overstated profit figures led us to pay substantial incentivecompensation that we should not have and to incur income taxes far earlier than was necessary.\nWe recommend scrapping the term loss development and its equally ugly twin, reserve strengthening.\n(Can you imagine an insurer, upon finding its reserves ex cessive, describing the reduction that follows as reserve\nweakening?)  Loss development suggests to investors th at some natural, uncontrollable event has occurred in the\ncurrent year, and reserve strengthening implies that ad equate amounts have been further buttressed.  The truth,\nhowever, is that management made an error in estimation that in turn produced an error in the earnings previouslyreported.  The losses didnt develop  they were there all along.  What developed was managements\nunderstanding of the losses (or, in the instances of ch icanery, managements w illingness to finally fess up).\nA more forthright label for the phenomenon at issue would be loss costs we failed to recognize when they\noccurred (or maybe just oops).  Underreserving, it should be noted, is a common  and serious  problem\nthroughout the property/casualty insurance industry.  At Berkshire we told you of our own problems withunderestimation in 1984 and 1986.  Generally, however, our reserving has been conservative.\nMajor underreserving is common in cases of companies struggling for survival.  In effect, insurance\naccounting is a self-graded exam, in that the insurer gives so me figures to its auditing firm and generally doesnt get\nan argument.  (What the auditor  gets, however, is a letter from management that is designed to take his firm off the\nhook if the numbers later look silly.)  A company experienci ng financial difficulties  of a kind that, if truly faced,\ncould put it out of business  seldom proves to be a tough grader.  Who, after all, wants to prepare his ownexecution papers?\nEven when companies have the best of intentions, its not easy to reserve properly.  Ive told the story in\nthe past about the fellow traveling abroad whose sister calle d to tell him that their dad had died.  The brother replied\nthat it was impossible for him to get home for the funeral; he volunteered, however, to shoulder its cost.  Uponreturning, the brother received a bill fro m the mortuary for $4,500, which he pr omptly paid.  A month later, and a\nmonth after that also, he paid $10 pursuant to an add-on invoice.  When a third $10 invoice came, he called hissister for an explanation.  Oh, she replied, I forgot to tell you.  We buried dad in a rented suit.\nThere are a lot of rented suits bur ied in the past operations of insurance companies.  Sometimes the\nproblems they signify lie dorma nt for decades, as was the case with asbest os liability, before virulently manifesting\nthemselves.  Difficult as the job may be, its mana gements responsibility to adequately account for all possibilities.\nConservatism is essential.  When a claims manager walks into the CEOs office and says Guess what just\nhappened, his boss, if a veteran, does not expect to h ear its good news.  Surprises in the insurance world have\nbeen far from symmetrical in  their effect on earnings.\n\n12Because of this one-sided experien ce, it is folly to suggest, as some are doing, that all property/casualty\ninsurance reserves be discounted , an approach reflecting the fact that they will be paid in the future and that\ntherefore their present value is le ss than the stated liability for th em.  Discounting might be acceptable if reserves\ncould be precisely established.  They  cant, however, because a myriad of fo rces  judicial broadening of policy\nlanguage and medical inflation, to name just two chr onic problems  are constantly working to make reserves\ninadequate.  Discounting would exacerbate  this already-serious situation a nd, additionally, w ould provide a new\ntool for the companies that are inclined to fudge.\nId say that the effects from telling a profit-challenged insurance CEO to lower reserves through\ndiscounting would be comparable to those that would ensue if a father told his 16-year-old son to have a normal sexlife.  Neither party needs that kind of push.\nSources of Reported Earnings\nThe table that follows shows the main sources of Berkshire's reported earnings.  In this presentation,\npurchase-accounting adjustments (primar ily relating to goodwill) are not a ssigned to the specific businesses to\nwhich they apply, but are instead aggregated and shown separately.  This procedure lets you view the earnings ofour businesses as they would have b een reported had we not purchased them .  In recent years, our expense for\ngoodwill amortization has been large.  Going forward, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) will no\nlonger require amortization of goodwill.   This change will increase our reported earnings (though not our true\neconomic earnings) and simplify this section of the report.\n(in millions)\nBerkshire’s Share\nof Net Earnings\n(after taxes and\nPre-Tax Earnings Minority interests)\n2001 2000 2001 2000\nOperating Earnings:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting  Reinsurance................................... $(4,318) $(1,416) $(2,824) $(911)Underwriting  GEICO .......................................... 221 (224) 144 (146)Underwriting  Other Primary ............................... 30 25 18 16Net Investment Income .......................................... 2,824 2,773 1,968 1,946\nBuilding Products\n(1)................................................... 461 34 287 21\nFinance and Financial Pr oducts Business ................. 519 530 336 343\nFlight Services........................................................... 186 213 105 126MidAmerican Energy (76% owned) ......................... 600 197 230 109Retail Operations....................................................... 175 175 101 104Scott Fetzer (excluding fi nance operation) ............... 129 122 83 80\nShaw Industries\n(2)...................................................... 292 -- 156 --\nOther Businesses ....................................................... 179 221 103 133Purchase-Accounting Adjust ments ...........................

Brown\nand Justin swamped by losses at Dexter.\nIve made three decisions relating to De xter that have hurt you in a major way:  (1) buying it in the first place;\n(2) paying for it with stock and (3) procrastinating when  the need for changes in its operations was obvious.  I\nwould like to lay these mistakes on Char lie (or anyone else, for that matter) but they were mine.  Dexter, prior\nto our purchase  and indeed for a few years after  prospered despite low-cost foreign competition that wasbrutal.  I concluded that Dexter could conti nue to cope with that problem, and I was wrong.\nWe have now placed the Dexter opera tion  which is still substantial in size  under the management of Frank\nRooney and Jim Issler at H.H. Brown.  These men have performed outstandingl y for Berkshire, skillfully\ncontending with the extraordinary changes that have bedeviled the footwear industry.  During part of 2002,\nDexter will be hurt by unprofitable sales commitments it made last year.  After that, we believe our shoe\nbusiness will be reasonably profitable.\n• MidAmerican Energy, of which we own 76% on a fully-diluted basis, had a good year in 2001.  Its reported\nearnings should also increase considerably in 2002 given that the company has been shouldering a largecharge for the amortization of goodwill and that th is cost will disappear under the new GAAP rules.\nLast year MidAmerican swapped some properties in England, adding Yorkshire Electric, with its 2.1 million\ncustomers.  We are now serving 3.6 million customers in the U.K. and are its 2\nnd largest electric utility.  We\nhave an equally important operation in Iowa as well as major generating facilities in California and thePhilippines.\nAt MidAmerican  this may surprise you  we also own the second-largest residential real estate brokerage\nbusiness in the country.  We are market-share leaders in a number of large cities, prim arily in the Midwest, and\nhave recently acquired important firm s in Atlanta and Southern Californi a.  Last year, operating under various\nnames that are locally familiar, we handled about 106,000 transactions involving properties worth nearly $20\nbillion.  Ron Peltier has built this business for us, and its likely he will make more acquisitions in 2002 and\nthe years to come.\n• Considering the recessionary environment plaguing them, our retailing operations did well in 2001.  In\njewelry, same-store sales fell 7.6% and pre-tax margin s were 8.9% versus 10.7% in 2000.  Return on invested\ncapital remains high.\nSame-store sales at our home-furnishings retailers we re unchanged and so was the margin  9.1% pre-tax \nthese operations earned.  Here, too, return on invested capital is excellent.\nWe continue to expand in both jewelr y and home-furnishings.  Of particular note, Nebraska Furniture Mart is\nconstructing a mammoth 450,000 square foot store that will serve the gr eater Kansas City area beginning in\nthe fall of 2003.  Despite Bill Childs counter-su ccesses, we will keep this store open on Sundays.\n• The large acquisitions we initiated in late 2000  Sh aw, Johns Manville and Benjamin Moore  all came\nthrough their first year with us in great fashion.  Charlie and I knew at the time of our purchases that we werein good hands with Bob Shaw, Jerry Henry and Yvan D upuy, respectively  and we admire their work even\nmore now.  Together these busine sses earned about $659 million pre-tax.\nShortly after yearend we exchanged 4,740 Berkshire A shares (or their equivalent in B shares) for the 12.7%\nminority interest in Shaw, which means we now own 100% of the company.  Shaw is our largest non-insurance operation and will play a big part in Berkshires future.\n• All of the income shown for Flight Services in 2001  and a bit more  came from FlightSafety, our pilot-\ntraining subsidiary.  Its earnings incr eased 2.5%, though return on invested capital fell slightly  because of the\n$258 million investment we made last y ear in simulators and other fixed assets.  My 84-year-old friend, Al\nUeltschi, continues to run FlightSafety with the same enthusiasm and competitive spirit that he has exhibitedsince 1951, when he invested $10,000 to start the company.  If I line Al up with a bunch of 60-year-olds at theannual meeting, you will not be able to pick him out.\n\n14After September 11th, training for commercial airlines fell, and t oday it remains depressed.  However, training\nfor business and general aviation, our main activity, is at  near-normal levels and should continue to grow.  In\n2002, we expect to spend $162 million fo r 27 simulators, a sum far in exce ss of our annual depreciation charge\nof $95 million.  Those who believe that EBITDA is in an y way equivalent to true earnings are welcome to pick\nup the tab.\nOur NetJets® fractional ownership program sold a record number of planes last year and also showed a gain of\n21.9% in service income from management fees and hourly  charges.  Nevertheless, it operated at a small loss,\nversus a small profit in 2000.  We made a little money in the U.S., but these earnings were more than offset by\nEuropean losses.  Measured by the value of our customers planes, NetJets accounts for about half of the\nindustry.  We believe the other participants, in aggregate, lost significant money.\nMaintaining a premier level of safety, security and service was always expensive, and the cost of sticking to\nthose standards was exacer bated by September 11th.  No matter how much the cost, we will continue to be the\nindustry leader in all three respects.  An uncompromising insistence on delivering only the best to hiscustomers is embedded in the DNA of Rich Santulli, CEO of the company and the inventor of fractional\nownership.  Im delighted with his fanaticism on these matters for both the companys sake and my familys: I\nbelieve the Buffetts fly more fractional-ownership hour s  we log in excess of 800 annually  than does any\nother family.  In case youre wondering, we use exactly the same planes and crews that serve NetJets other\ncustomers.\nNetJets experienced a spurt in new orders shortly after September 11\nth, but its sales pace has since returned to\nnormal.  Per-customer usage declined somewhat during the year, probably because of the recession.\nBoth we and our customers derive significant operationa l benefits from our being the runaway leader in the\nfractional ownership business.  We have more than  300 planes constantly on the go in the U.S. and can\ntherefore be wherever a customer needs us on very s hort notice.  The ubiquity of our fleet also reduces our\npositioning costs below those incurred by operators with smaller fleets.These advantages of scale, and ot hers we have, give NetJets a signi ficant economic edge over competition.\nUnder the competitive conditions likely to prevail for a few years, however , our advantage will at best produce\nmodest profits.\n• Our finance and financial products line of business now includes XTRA, General Re Securities (which is in a\nrun-off mode that will continue for an extended period) and a few other relatively small operations.  The bulk\nof the assets and liabilities in this  segment, however, arise from a few fixed-income stra tegies, involving\nhighly-liquid AAA securities, that I manage.  This activity, which only makes sense when certain market\nrelationships exist, has produced good returns in the pa st and has reasonable prospects for continuing to do so\nover the next year or two.\nInvestments\nBelow we present our common stock investments.  Those that had a market value of more than $500\nmillion at the end of 2001 are itemized.\n12/31/01\nShares\nCompany Cost Market\n(dollars in millions)\n151,610,700 American Express Company..................................................................... $  1,470 $  5,410\n200,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company.......................................................................... 1,299 9,430\n96,000,000 The Gillette Company ............................................................................... 600 3,20615,999,200 H&R Block, Inc. ....................................................................................... 255 71524,000,000 Moodys Corporation................................................................................ 499 957\n1,727,765 The Washington Post Company................................................................ 11 916\n53,265,080 Wells Fargo & Company .......................................................................... 306 2,315\nOthers........................................................................................................     4,103\n    5,726\nTotal Common Stocks............................................................................... $8,543 $28,675\n\n15We made few changes in our portfolio during 2001.  As a group, our larger holdings have performed\npoorly in the last few years, some because of disappoi nting operating results.  Charlie and I still like the basic\nbusinesses of all the companies we own.  But we do not believe Berkshires equity holdings as a group are\nundervalued.\nOur restrained enthusiasm for thes e securities is matched by decide dly lukewarm feelings about the\nprospects for stocks in general over the next decade or so.  I expressed my vi ews about equity returns in a speech I\ngave at an Allen and Company meeting in July (which was a follow-up to a similar presentation I had made twoyears earlier) and an edited version of my comments appeared in a December 10\nth Fortune  article.  Im enclosing a\ncopy of that article.  You can also view the Fortune  version of my 1999 talk at our website\nwww.berkshirehathaway.com .\nCharlie and I believe that American business will do fine over time but think that todays equity prices\npresage only moderate returns for investors.  The mark et outperformed business for a very long period, and that\nphenomenon had to end.  A market that no more than para llels business progress, however, is likely to leave many\ninvestors disappointed, particularly those relatively new to the game.\nHeres one for those who enjoy an odd coincide nce: The Great Bubble ended on March 10, 2000 (though\nwe didnt realize that fact until some months later).  On that day, the NASDAQ (recently  1,731) hit its all-time high\nof 5,132.  That same day, Berkshire shares traded at $40,800, their lowest price since mid-1997.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nDuring 2001, we were somewhat more active than usual in junk bonds.  These are not, we should\nemphasize, suitable investments for the general public, because too often these securities live up to their name.  We\nhave never  purchased a newly-issued junk bond, which is the only kind most investors are urged to buy.  When\nlosses occur in this field, furthermore, they are often disastrous: Many issues end up at a small fraction of theiroriginal offering price and some become entirely worthless.\nDespite these dangers, we periodically find a few  a very few  junk securities that are interesting to us.\nAnd, so far, our 50-year experience in distressed de bt has proven rewarding.  In our 1984 annual report, we\ndescribed our purchases of Washington Public Power System bonds when that issuer fell into disrepute.  Wevealso, over the years, stepped into other apparent calamities such as Chrysler Financial, Texaco and RJR Nabisco all of which returned to grace.  Still,  if we stay active in junk bonds, you can  expect us to have losses from time to\ntime.\nOccasionally, a purchase of distressed bonds leads us into something bigge r.  Early in the Fruit of the\nLoom bankruptcy, we purchased the companys public and bank debt at about 50% of face value.  This was an\nunusual bankruptcy in that interest payments on senior de bt were continued without interruption, which meant we\nearned about a 15% current return.  Ou r holdings grew to 10% of Fruits se nior debt, which will probably end up\nreturning us about 70% of face value.  Through this investment, we indirectly reduced our purchase price for the\nwhole company by a small amount.\nIn late 2000, we began purchasing the obligations of FINOVA Group, a troubled finance company, and\nthat, too, led to our making a major transaction.  FINOVA then had about $11 billion of debt outstanding, of which\nwe purchased 13% at about two-thirds of face value.  We  expected the company to go into bankruptcy, but believed\nthat liquidation of its assets would produce a payoff for cr editors that would be well above our cost.  As default\nloomed in early 2001, we joined forces with Leucadia National Corporation to present the company with aprepackaged plan for bankruptcy.\nThe plan as subsequently modified (and Im simplif ying here) provided that creditors would be paid 70%\nof face value (along with full interest) and that they would receive a newly- issued 7½% note for the 30% of their\nclaims not satisfied by cash.  To fund FINOVAs 70% dist ribution, Leucadia and Berkshire formed a jointly-owned\nentity  mellifluently christen ed Berkadia  that borrowed $5.6 billion th rough FleetBoston and, in turn, re-lent this\nsum to FINOVA, concurrently obtaining a priority claim on its assets.  Berk shire guaranteed 90% of the Berkadia\nborrowing and also has a sec ondary guarantee on the 10% for which Leucad ia has primary responsibility.  (Did I\nmention that I am simplifying?).\n\n16There is a spread of about two percentage points between what Berkadia pays on its borrowing and what it\nreceives from FINOVA, with this spread flowing 90% to Berkshire and 10% to Leucadia.  As I write this, each loan\nhas been paid down to $3.9 billion.\nAs part of the bankruptcy plan, which was approved on August 10, 2001, Berkshire also agreed to offer\n70% of face value for up to $500 million principal amount of the $3.25 billion of new 7½% bonds that were issued\nby FINOVA.  (Of these, we had already received $426.8 m illion in principal amount because of our 13% ownership\nof the original debt.)  Our offer, which was to run until September 26, 2001, could be  withdrawn under a variety of\nconditions, one of which became operative if the New Yo rk Stock Exchange closed  during the offering period.\nWhen that indeed occurred in  the week of September 11th, we promptly terminated the offer.\nMany of FINOVAs loans involve aircraft assets whose values were significantly diminished by the events\nof September 11th.  Other receivables held by the company also were imperiled by the economic consequences of\nthe attack that day.  FINOVAs prospects, therefore, are not as good as when we made our proposal to thebankruptcy court.  Nevertheless we feel that overall the tr ansaction will prove satisfactory for Berkshire.  Leucadia\nhas day-to-day operating responsibility for FINOVA, and we have long been impressed with the business acumen\nand managerial talent of its key executives.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIts déjà vu time again: In early 1965, when the invest ment partnership I ran took control of Berkshire, that\ncompany had its main banking relationships with First National Bank of Boston and a large New York City bank.\nPreviously, I had done no business with either.\nFast forward to 1969, when I wanted Berkshire to buy the Illinois National Bank and Trust of Rockford.\nWe needed $10 million, and I contact ed both banks.  There was no respons e from New York.  However, two\nrepresentatives of the Boston bank immediately came to Omaha.  They told me they would supply the money forour purchase and that we would work out the details later.\nFor the next three decades, we borrowed almost not hing from banks.  (Debt is a four-letter word around\nBerkshire.)  Then, in February, when we were struct uring the FINOVA transaction, I again called Boston, where\nFirst National had morphed into FleetBo ston.  Chad Gifford, the companys pr esident, responded just as Bill Brown\nand Ira Stepanian had back in 1969  youve got th e money and well work out the details later.\nAnd thats just what happened.  FleetBoston syndicated a loan for $6 billion (as it turned out, we didnt\nneed $400 million of it), and it was quickly oversubscribed by 17 banks throughout the world.  Sooooo . . . if you\never need $6 billion, just give Chad a ca ll  assuming, that is, your credit is AAA.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nOne more point about our investments: The media often report that Buffett is buying this or that security,\nhaving picked up the fact from reports that Berkshire f iles.  These accounts are sometimes correct, but at other\ntimes the transactions Berkshire reports are actually being made by Lou Simpson, who runs a $2 billion portfolio forGEICO that is quite independent of me.  Normally, Lou doe s not tell me what he is buying or selling, and I learn of\nhis activities only when I look at a GEICO portfolio summary that I receive a few days after the end of each month.\nLous thinking, of course, is quite similar to mine, but we usually end up in different securities.  Thats largelybecause hes working with less money a nd can therefore invest in smaller comp anies than I.  Oh, yes, theres also\nanother minor difference between us:\n In recent years, Lous performance has been far better than mine.\n\n17Charitable Contributions\nBerkshire follows a highly unusual policy in respect to charitable contributions  but its one that Charlie\nand I believe is both rati onal and fair to owners.\nFirst, we let our operating subsidiaries make thei r own charitable decisions, requesting only that the\nowners/managers who once ran these as indepe ndent companies make all donations to their persona l charities from\ntheir own funds, instead of using company money.  When our managers are using company funds, we trust them tomake gifts in a manner that delivers commensurate tangible or intangible benefits to the operations they manage.Last year contributions from Berksh ire subsidiaries totaled $19.2 million.\nAt the parent company level, we make no contributi ons except those designated by shareholders.  We do\nnot match contributions made by directors or employees, nor do we give to the favorite charities of the Buffetts orthe Mungers.  However, prior to our purchasing them, a few of our subsidiaries had employee-match programs andwe feel fine about their continuing them: Its not our style to tamper with successful business cultures.\nTo implement our owners’  charitable desires, each year we notif y registered holders of A shares (As\nrepresent 86.6% of our equity capital) of a per-share amount that they can instruct us to contribute to as many asthree charities.  Shareholders name the charity; Berkshir e writes the check.  Any organization that qualifies under\nthe Internal Revenue Code can be designated by sharehol ders.  Last year Berkshire made contributions of $16.7\nmillion at the direction of 5,700 shar eholders, who named 3,550 charities as recipients.  Since we started this\nprogram, our shareholders gi fts have totaled $181 million.\nMost public corporations eschew gifts to religious institutions.  These, however, are favorite charities of\nour shareholders, who last year na med 437 churches and synagogues to recei ve gifts.  Add itionally, 790 schools\nwere recipients.  A few of our larger shareholders, in cluding Charlie and me, designate their personal foundations to\nget gifts, so that those entities can, in  turn, disburse their funds widely.\nI get a few letters every week critic izing Berkshire for contributing to  Planned Parenthood.  These letters\nare usually prompted by an organization that wishes to see boycotts of Berkshire products.  The letters areinvariably polite and sincere, but their writers are unaware of a key point: Its not Berkshire, but rather its ownerswho are making charitable decisions  and these owners are about as diverse in their opinions as you can imagine.For example, they are probably on both sides of the abortion issue in roughly the same proportion as the Americanpopulation.  Well follow their instructions, whether they designate Planned Parenthood or Metro Right to Life, just\nas long as the charity possesses 501(c)(3) status.  Its as if we paid a dividend, which the shareholder then donated.\nOur form of disbursement, however, is more tax-efficient.\nIn neither the purchase of goods nor the hiring of pers onnel, do we ever consider the religious views, the\ngender, the race or the sexual orientation of the persons we  are dealing with.  It woul d not only be wrong to do so, it\nwould be idiotic.  We need all of the talent we can find,  and we have learned that able and trustworthy managers,\nemployees and suppliers come from a very wide spectrum of humanity.\n* * * * * * * * * * *\nTo participate in our future charitable contribution programs, you must own Class A shares that are\nregistered in the name of the actual owner, not the nominee name of a broker, bank or depository.  Shares not so\nregistered on August 31, 2002 will be ineligible for the 2002 program.  When you get the contributions form from\nus, return it promptly.  Designations received after the due  date will not be honored.\n\n18The Annual Meeting\nThis year’s annual meeting will be on Saturday, May 4, and we will again be at the Civic Auditorium.  The\ndoors will open at 7 a.m., the movie will begin at 8:30, a nd the meeting itself will commence at 9:30.  There will be\na short break at noon for food.  (Sandwiches can be bought at the Civic’s concession stands.)  Except for that\ninterlude, Charlie and I will answer questions until 3:30.  Give us your best shot.\nFor at least the next year, the Civic,  located downtown, is the only site available to us.  We must therefore\nhold the meeting on either Saturday or Sunday to avoid the traffic and parking nightmare sure to occur on a\nweekday.  Shortly, however, Omaha will have a new Conventi on Center with plenty of parking facilities.  Assuming\nthat we then head for the Center, I w ill poll shareholders to see whether you wish to return to the Monday meeting\nthat was standard until 2000.  We will decide that vote ba sed on a count of shareholde rs, not shares.  (This is not a\nsystem, however, we will ever institu te to decide who should be CEO.)\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car reservations, wehave again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help .  They do a terrific job for us each\nyear, and I thank them for it.\nIn our usual fashion, we will run buses from the larger hotels to the meeting.  Afterwards, the buses will\nmake trips back to the hotels and to Nebraska Furniture Ma rt, Borsheim’s and the airport.   Even so, you are likely to\nfind a car useful.\nWe have added so many new companies to Berkshire this year that I’m not going to detail all of the\nproducts that we will be selling  at the meeting.  But come  prepared to carry home everything from bricks to candy.\nAnd underwear, of course.  Assuming our Fruit of the L oom purchase has closed by May 4, we will be selling\nFruit’s latest styles, which will make you your neighborhood’s fashion leader.  Buy a lifetime supply.\nGEICO will have a booth staffed by  a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of them\nready to supply you with au to insurance quotes.  In most cases, GE ICO will be able to give you a special\nshareholder discount (usually 8%).  This  special offer is permitted by 41 of th e 49 jurisdictions in which we operate.\nBring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money.\nAt the Omaha airport on Saturday, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets® available for your\ninspection.  Just ask a representative at the Civic about viewing any of these planes.  If you buy what we consider anappropriate number of items during the weekend, you may well need your own plane to take them home.  And, ifyou buy a fraction of a plane, we might even throw in a three-pack of briefs or boxers.\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 75-acre site on 72\nnd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will\nagain be having “Berkshire W eekend” pricing, which means we will be o ffering our shareholders  a discount that is\ncustomarily given only to employees.  We initiated this special pricing at NFM five years ago, and sales during the“Weekend” grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $11.5 million in 2001.\nTo get the discount, you must make your purchases on Thursday, May 2 through Monday, May 6 and also\npresent your meeting credential.  The period’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious\nmanufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but that, in the spirit of our shareholderweekend, have made an exception for you.  We appreciat e their cooperation.  NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.\non weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.\nBorsheim’s  the largest jewelry store in the country except for Tiffany’s Manhattan store  will have\ntwo shareholder-only events.  The firs t will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m.  to 10 p.m. on Friday, May 3.  The\nsecond, the main gala, will be from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday, May 5.  Shareholder prices will be available\nThursday through Monday, so if you wi sh to avoid the large crowds that will assemble on Friday evening and\nSunday, come at other times and identify yourself as a shareholder.  On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m.\nBorsheim’s operates on a gross margin that is fully twenty percentage points below that of its major rivals, so themore you buy, the more you save (or at least that’s wh at my wife and daughter tell me).  Come by and let us\nperform a walletectomy on you.\nIn the mall outside of Borsheim’s, we will have some of the world’s top bridge experts available to play\nwith our shareholders on Sunday afternoon.  We expect  Bob and Petra Hamman along with Sharon Osberg to host\ntables.  Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, will also be in the mall, taking on all comers  blindfolded!\n\n19Last year, Patrick played as many as six games simultaneously  with his blindfold securely in place  and this\nyear will try for seven.  Finally, Bill Robertie, one of only two players who have twice won the backgammon world\nchampionship, will be on hand to test y our skill at that game.  Come to th e mall on Sunday for the Mensa Olympics.\nGorat’s  my favorite steakhouse  will again be open exclusively fo r Berkshire shareholders on Sunday,\nMay 5, and will be serving from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  Pleas e remember that to come to Gorat’s on Sunday, you must\nhave a reservation.  To ma ke one, call 402-551-3733 on April 1 ( but not before ).  If Sunday is sold out, try Gorat’s\non one of the other evenings you will be in town.  Show your sophistication by ordering a rare T-bone with a double\norder of hash browns.\nThe usual baseball game will be held at Rosenblatt Stadium at 7 p.m. on Saturday night.  This year the\nOmaha Royals will play the Oklahoma RedHawks.  Last y ear, in an attempt to emulate the career switch of Babe\nRuth, I gave up pitching and tried batting.  Bob Gibson,  an Omaha native, was on the mound and I was terrified,\nfearing Bob’s famous brush-back pitch.  Instead, he de livered a fast ball in the strike zone, and with a Mark\nMcGwire-like swing, I managed to connect for a hard grounder, which inexplicably died in the infield.  I didn’t run\nit out: At my age, I get winded playing a hand of bridge.\nI’m not sure what will take place at the ballpark this  year, but come out and be surprised.  Our proxy\nstatement contains instructions for obtaining tickets to  the game.  Those people ordering tickets to the annual\nmeeting will receive a booklet c ontaining all manner of inform ation that should help you enjoy your visit in Omaha.\nThere will be plenty of action in town .  So come for Woodstock Weekend and join our Celebration of Capitalism at\nthe Civic.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nFinally, I would like to thank the wonderful and incredibly productive crew at World Headquarters (all\n5,246.5 square feet of it) who make my job so easy.  Berkshire added about 40,000 employees last year, bringing\nour workforce to 110,000.  At headquarters we added one em ployee and now have 14.8.  (I’ve tried in vain to get\nJoEllen Rieck to change her workweek from four days to five; I think she likes the national recognition she gains by\nbeing .8.)\nThe smooth handling of the array of duties that come with our current size and scope – as well as some\nadditional activities almost unique to Berkshire, such as our shareholder gala and designated-gifts program – takes avery special group of people.  And that we most definitely have.\nWarren E. Buffett\nFebruary 28, 2002 Chairman of the Board",

In th is table, Berkshire's results\nthrough 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rule s.  In all other respects, the results are calculated using\nthe numbers originally reported.\nThe S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax  whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax .  If a corporation such as Berkshire\nwere simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appr opriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500\nin years when that index showed a pos itive return, but would have exceeded the S&P in years when the index showed a\nnegative return.  Over the years, the tax costs woul d have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n\n3BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOur gain in net worth during 2002 was $6.1 billion, which increased the per-share book value of\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 10.0%.  Over the last 38 years (that is, since present management\ntook over) per-share book value has grown from $19 to $41,727, a rate of 22.2% compounded annually.∗\nIn all respects 2002 was a banner year.  I’ll provide details later, but here’s a summary:\n• Our various non-insurance operations performed exceptionally well, despite a sluggish economy.\nA decade ago Berkshire’s annual pre-tax earni ngs from our non-insurance businesses was $272\nmillion. Now, from our ever-expanding collection of manufacturing, retailing, service and finance\nbusinesses, we earn that sum monthly .\n• Our insurance group increased its float to $41.2 billio n, a hefty gain of $5.7 billion.  Better yet, the\nuse of these funds in 2002 cost us only 1%.  Ge tting back to low-cost float feels good, particularly\nafter our poor results during the three previous years.  Berkshire’s reinsurance division and\nGEICO shot the lights out in 2002, and underwriting discipline was restored at General Re.\n• Berkshire acquired some important new busine sses – with economic characteristics ranging from\ngood to great, run by managers ranging from great to great.  Those attributes are two legs of our“entrance” strategy, the third being a sensible purc hase price.  Unlike LBO operators and private\nequity firms, we have no “exit” strategy – we buy to keep.  That’s one reason why Berkshire is\nusually the first – and sometimes the only – choice for sellers and their managers.\n• Our marketable securities outperformed most indices.  For Lou Simpson, who manages equities at\nGEICO, this was old stuff.  But, for me, it was a welcome change from th e last few years, during\nwhich my investment record was dismal.\nThe confluence of these favorable factors in 2002 caused our book-value gain to outstrip the\nperformance of the S&P 500 by 32.1 percentage po ints.  This result is aberrational: Charlie Munger,\nBerkshire’s vice chairman and my partner, and I hope to achieve – at most  – an average annual advantage\nof a few points.  In the future, there will be years in  which the S&P soundly trounces us.  That will in fact\nalmost certainly happen during a strong bull market, because the portion of our assets committed to\ncommon stocks has significantly declined.  This chan ge, of course, helps our relative performance in down\nmarkets such as we had in 2002.\nI have another caveat to mention about last year’s results.  If you’ve been a reader of financial\nreports in recent years, you ’ve seen a flood of “pro-forma” earning s statements – tabulations in which\nmanagers invariably show “earnings” far in excess of those allowed by their auditors.  In these\npresentations, the CEO tells his owners “don’t count this, don’t count that – just count what makes earningsfat.”  Often, a forget-all-this-bad-stuff message is de livered year after year without management so much as\nblushing.\n                                                          \n∗All figures used in this report apply to Berksh ire's A shares, the successo r to the only stock that\nthe company had outstanding before 1996.  The B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30th that of\nthe A.\n\n4We’ve yet to see a pro-forma presentation disclosi ng that audited earnings were somewhat high.\nSo let’s make a little history: Last year , on a pro-forma basis, Berkshire had lower  earnings than those we\nactually reported.\nThat is true because two favorable factors aided our reported figures.  First, in 2002 there was no\nmegacatastrophe, which means that Berkshire (and othe r insurers as well) earned more from insurance than\nif losses had been normal.  In years when the reverse is true – because of a blockbuster hurricane,earthquake or man-made disaster – many insurers like to report that they would have earned X “except for”\nthe unusual event.  The implication is that since su ch megacats are infrequent, they shouldn’t be counted\nwhen “true” earnings are calculated.  That is deceptive nonsense.  “Excep t for” losses will forever be part\nof the insurance business, and they will fo rever be paid with shareholders’ money.\nNonetheless, for the purposes of this exercise, we’ ll take a page from the industry’s book.  For last\nyear, when we didn’t have any truly major disasters, a downward adjustment is appropriate if you wish to\n“normalize” our underwriting result.\nSecondly, the bond market in 2002 favored certain strategies we employed in our finance and\nfinancial products business.  Gains from those strategies  will certainly diminish within a year or two – and\nmay well disappear.\nSoooo . . . “except for” a couple of favorable breaks, our pre-tax earnings last year would have\nbeen about $500 million less than we actually reported.  We’re happy, nevertheless, to bank the excess.  As\nJack Benny once said upon receiving an award: “I don’t deserv e this honor – but, then , I have arthritis, and\nI don’t deserve that either.”\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nWe continue to be blessed with an extraordinary group of managers, many of whom haven’t the\nslightest financial need to work.  They stick around, though: In 38 years, we’ve never had a single CEO ofa subsidiary elect to leave Berkshire to work elsewh ere.  Counting Charlie, we now have six managers over\n75, and I hope that in four years that number increases by at least two (Bob Shaw and I are both 72).  Our\nrationale: “It’s hard to teach a new dog old tricks.”\nBerkshire’s operating CEOs are masters of their cr afts and run their businesses as if they were\ntheir own.  My job is to stay out of their way and a llocate whatever excess capital their businesses generate.\nIt’s easy work.\nMy managerial model is Eddie Bennett, who was a batboy.  In 1919, at age 19, Eddie began his\nwork with the Chicago White Sox, who that year went  to the World Series.  The next year, Eddie switched\nto the Brooklyn Dodgers, and they, too, won their league title.  Our hero, however, smelled trouble.\nChanging boroughs, he joined the Yankees in 1921, and they promptly won their first pennant in history.\nNow Eddie settled in, shrewdly seeing what was coming.  In the next seven years, the Yankees won fiveAmerican League titles.\nWhat does this have to do with management?  It’s simple – to be a winner, work with winners.  In\n1927, for example, Eddie received $700 for the 1/ 8th World Series share voted him by the legendary\nYankee team of Ruth and Gehrig.  This sum, which Eddie earned by working only  four days (because New\nYork swept the Series) was roughly equal to the full- year pay then earned by batboys who worked with\nordinary associates.\nEddie understood that how he lugged bats was unimportant; what counted instead was hooking up\nwith the cream of those on the playing field.  I’ve learned from Eddie.  At Berkshire, I regularly hand bats\nto many of the heaviest hitters in American business.\nAcquisitions\nWe added some sluggers to our lineup last year.  Two acquisitions pending at yearend 2001 were\ncompleted: Albecca (which operates un der the name Larson-Juhl), the U.S.  leader in custom-made picture\nframes; and Fruit of the Loom, the producer of about 33.3% of the men’s and boy’s underwear sold in the\nU.S. and of other apparel as well.\n\n5Both companies came with outs tanding CEOs: Steve McKenzie at Albecca and John Holland at\nFruit.  John, who had retired from Fruit in 1996, re joined it three years ago an d rescued the company from\nthe disastrous path it had gone down after he’d left.  He’s now 70, and I am trying to convince him to makehis next retirement coincident with mine (presently scheduled for five years after my death – a date subject,\nhowever, to extension).\nWe initiated and completed two other acquisitions la st year that were somewhat below our normal\nsize threshold.  In aggregate, however, these busine sses earn more than $60 million pre-tax annually.  Both\noperate in industries characterized by tough economics, but both also have important competitive strengths\nthat enable them to earn decent returns on capital.\nThe newcomers are:\n(a) CTB, a worldwide leader in equipment for the poultry, hog, egg production and grain\nindustries; and\n(b) Garan, a manufacturer of children’s apparel, whose largest and best-known line is\nGaranimals®.\nThese two companies came with the managers re sponsible for their impressive records: Vic\nMancinelli at CTB and Seymour Lichtenstein at Garan.\nThe largest acquisition we initiated in 2002 was Th e Pampered Chef, a company with a fascinating\nhistory dating back to 1980.  Doris Christopher was then a 34-year-old suburban Chicago home economics\nteacher with a husban d, two little girls, and absolutely no busi ness background.  Wa nting, however, to\nsupplement her family’s modest income, she turned to thinking about what she knew best – foodpreparation.  Why not, she wondered, make a business out of marketing kitchenware, focusing on the items\nshe herself had found most useful?\nTo get started, Doris borrowed $3,000 agai nst her life insurance policy – all the money ever\ninjected into the company – and went to the Merchandise Mart on a buying expedition.  There, she picked\nup a dozen each of this and that, and then went home to set up operations in her basement.\nHer plan was to conduct in-home presentations to small groups of women, gathered at the homes\nof their friends.  While driving to her first presentation, though, Doris almost talked herself into returning\nhome, convinced she was doomed to fail.\nBut the women she faced that evening loved her and her products, purchased $175 of goods, and\nTPC was underway.  Working with her husband, Jay, Doris did $50,000 of business in the first year.\nToday – only 22 years later – TPC does more than $700 million of business annually, working through\n67,000 kitchen consultants.\nI’ve been to a TPC party, and it’s easy to see why the business is a success.  The company’s\nproducts, in large part proprietary, are well-styled and highly useful, and the consultants are knowledgeableand enthusiastic.  Everyone has a good time.  Hurry to  pamperedchef.com on the Internet to find where to\nattend a party near you.\nTwo years ago, Doris brought in Sheila O’Connell Cooper, now CEO, to share the management\nload, and in August they met with me in Omaha.  It took me about ten seconds to decide that these were\ntwo managers with whom I wished to partner, and we promptly made a deal.  Berkshire shareholders\ncouldn’t be luckier than to be associated with Doris and Sheila.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nBerkshire also made some important acquisitions last year through MidAmerican Energy Holdings\n(MEHC), a company in which our equity interest is 80.2%.  Because the Public Utility Holding Company\nAct (PUHCA) limits us to 9.9% voting control, how ever, we are unable to fully consolidate MEHC’s\nfinancial statements.\nDespite the voting-control limitation – and the somewhat strange capital structure at MEHC it has\nengendered – the company is a key part of Berkshire.   Already it has $18 billion of assets and delivers our\nlargest stream of non-insurance earnings.  It could well grow to be huge.\n\n6Last year MEHC acquired two important gas pipelines.  The first, Kern River, extends from\nSouthwest Wyoming to Southern California.  This line moves about 900 million cubic feet of gas a day and\nis undergoing a $1.2 billion expansion that will double throughput by this fall.  At that point, the line willcarry enough gas to generate electricity for ten million homes.\nThe second acquisition, Northern Natural Gas, is a 16,600 mile line extending from the Southwest\nto a wide range of Midwestern locations.  This purchase completes a corporate odyssey of particular\ninterest to Omahans.\nFrom its beginnings in the 1930s, Northern Natural was one of Omaha’s premier businesses, run\nby CEOs who regularly distinguished themselves as co mmunity leaders.  Then, in  July, 1985, the company\n– which in 1980 had been renamed InterNorth – merged with Houston Natural Gas, a business less than\nhalf its size.  The companies announced that the enlarged operation would be headquartered in Omaha,\nwith InterNorth’s CEO continuing in that job.\nWithin a year, those promises were broken.  By  then, the former CEO of Houston Natural had\ntaken over the top job at InterNorth, the company had been renamed, and the headquarters had been movedto Houston.  These switches were orchestrated by the new CEO – Ken Lay – and the name he chose was\nEnron.\nFast forward 15 years to late 2001.  Enron ran into the troubles we’ve heard so much about and\nborrowed money from Dynegy, putting up the Northern Natural pipeline operation as collateral.  The two\ncompanies quickly had a falling out, and the pipeline’s ownership moved to Dynegy.  That company, in\nturn, soon encountered severe financial problems of its own.\nMEHC received a call on Friday, July 26, from  Dynegy, which was looking for a quick and\ncertain cash sale of the pipeline.  Dynegy phoned the right party: On July 29, we signed a contract, and\nshortly thereafter Northe rn Natural returned home.\nWhen 2001 began, Charlie and I had no idea that Berkshire would be moving into the pipeline\nbusiness.  But upon completion of the Kern River expansion, MEHC will transport about 8% of all gas\nused in the U.S.  We continue to look for large energy-related assets, though in the electric utility fieldPUHCA constrains what we can do.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nA few years ago, and somewhat by accident, MEHC  found itself in the residential real estate\nbrokerage business.  It is no acci dent, however, that we have dr amatically expanded the operation.\nMoreover, we are likely to keep on expanding in the future.\nWe call this business HomeServices of America.  In the various communities it serves, though, it\noperates under the names of the businesses it has acquired, such as CBS in Omaha, Edina Realty in\nMinneapolis and Iowa Realty in Des Moines.  In most  metropolitan areas in which we operate, we are the\nclear market leader.\nHomeServices is now the second largest residen tial brokerage business in the country.  On one\nside or the other (or both), we participated in $37 billion of transactions last year, up 100% from 2001.\nMost of our growth came from three acquisitions we  made during 2002, the largest of which was\nPrudential California Realty.  Last year, this company,  the leading realtor in a territory consisting of Los\nAngeles, Orange and San Diego Counties, participated in $16 billion of closings.\nIn a very short period, Ron Peltier, the company’ s CEO, has increased Ho meServices’ revenues –\nand profits – dramatically.  Though this business will always be cyclical, it’s one we like and in which we\ncontinue to have an appetite for sensible acquisitions.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nDave Sokol, MEHC’s CEO, and Greg Abel, his key associate, are huge assets for Berkshire.  They\nare dealmakers, and they are managers.  Berkshire stands ready to inject massive amounts of money into\nMEHC – and it will be fun to watch how fa r Dave and Greg can take the business.\n\n7The Economics of Property/Casualty Insurance\nOur core business — though we have others of great importance — is insurance.  To understand\nBerkshire, therefore, it is necessary that you understa nd how to evaluate an in surance company.  The key\ndeterminants are: (1) the amount of fl oat that the business generates; (2) its  cost; and (3) most critical of all,\nthe long-term outlook for both of these factors.\nTo begin with, float is money we hold but don't own.  In an insurance operation, float arises\nbecause premiums are received before losses are paid, an  interval that sometimes extends over many years.\nDuring that time, the insurer invests the money.  This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside:\nThe premiums that an insurer takes in usually do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay.\nThat leaves it running an “underwriting loss,” which is the cost of float.  An insurance business has value if\nits cost of float over time is less than the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain funds.  But the\nbusiness is a lemon if its cost of float is higher than market rates for money.  Moreover, the downward\ntrend of interest rates in recent years has transformed underwriting losse s that formerly were tolerable into\nburdens that move insurance businesses deeply into the lemon category.\nHistorically, Berkshire has obtained its float at a very low cost.  Indeed, our cost has been less than\nzero in many years; that is, we’ve actually been paid for holding other people’s money.  In 2001, however,\nour cost was terrible, coming in at 12.8%, about ha lf of which was attributable to World Trade Center\nlosses.  Back in 1983-84, we had years that were even  worse.  There’s nothing automatic about cheap float.\nThe table that follows shows (at intervals) th e float generated by the various segments of\nBerkshire’s insurance operations since we entered the business 36 years ago upon acquiring NationalIndemnity Company (whose traditional lines are included  in the segment “Other Primary”).  For the table\nwe have calculated our float — which we generate in large amounts relative to our premium volume — byadding net loss reserves, loss adjustment reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearnedpremium reserves, and then subtracting insurance-re lated receivables, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid\ntaxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance.  (Got that?)\nYearend Float (in $ millions)\nOther Other\nYear\nGEICO General Re Reinsurance Primary Total\n1967 20 20\n1977 40 131 1711987 701 807 1,5081997 2,917 4,014 455 7,3861998 3,125 14,909 4,305 415 22,7541999 3,444 15,166 6,285 403 25,2982000 3,943 15,525 7,805 598 27,8712001 4,251 19,310 11,262 685 35,5082002 4,678 22,207 13,396 943 41,224\nLast year our cost of float was 1%.  As I mentioned earlier, you should temper your enthusiasm\nabout this favorable result given that  no megacatastrophe occurred in 2002.  We’re certain to get one of\nthese disasters periodically, and when we do our float-cost will spike.\n\n8Our 2002 results were hurt by 1) a painful charge at General Re for losses that should have been\nrecorded as costs in earlier years, and 2) a “desirable” charge we incur annually for retroactive insurance (see\nthe next section for more about these items).  These costs totaled $1.75 billion, or about 4.6% of float.\nFortunately, our overall underwriting experience on 2002 business was excellent, which allowed us, evenafter the charges noted, to approach a no-cost result.\nAbsent a megacatastrophe, I expect our  cost of float in 2003 to again be very low – perhaps even less\nthan zero.  In the rundown of our insurance operations  that follows, you will see why I’m optimistic that, over\ntime, our underwriting results will both surpass those achie ved by the industry and deliver us investable funds\nat minimal cost.\nInsurance Operations\nIf our insurance operations are to generate low-co st float over time, they must: (a) underwrite with\nunwavering discipline; (b) reserve conservatively; and (c ) avoid an aggregation of exposures that would allow\na supposedly “impossible” incident to threaten their solvency.  All of our major insurance businesses, with\none exception, have regularly met those tests.\nThe exception is General Re, and there was much to do at that company last year to get it up to\nsnuff.  I’m delighted to report that under Joe Bran don’s leadership, and with yeoman assistance by Tad\nMontross, enormous progress has been made on each of th e fronts described.\nWhen I agreed in 1998 to merge Berkshire with Gen Re, I thought that company stuck to the three\nrules I’ve enumerated.  I had studied the operation for decades and had observed underwriting discipline that\nwas consistent and reserving that was conservative.  At merger time, I detected no slippage in Gen Re’s\nstandards.\nI was dead wrong.  Gen Re’s culture and practices had substantially changed and unbeknownst to\nmanagement – and to me – the company was grossly mispricing its current business.  In addition, Gen Re had\naccumulated an aggregation of risks th at would have been fatal had, say,  terrorists detonated several large-\nscale nuclear bombs in an attack on the U.S.  A disaster  of that scope was highly improbable, of course, but it\nis up to insurers to limit their risks in a manner that leaves their finances rock-solid if the “impossible”\nhappens.  Indeed, had Gen Re remained independent, the World Trade Center attack alone would havethreatened the company’s existence.\nWhen the WTC disaster occurred, it exposed weaknesses in Gen Re’s operations that I should have\ndetected earlier.  But I was lucky: Joe and Tad were on hand, freshly endowed with increased authority and\neager to rapidly correct the errors of the past .  They knew what to do – and they did it.\nIt takes time for insurance policies to run off, however, and 2002 was well along before we managed\nto reduce our aggregation of nuclear, chemical and biologi cal risk (NCB) to a tolerable level.  That problem is\nnow behind us.\nOn another front, Gen Re’s underwriting attitude  has been dramatically altered: The entire\norganization now understands that we wish to write only properly-priced business, whatever the effect on\nvolume.  Joe and Tad judge themselves only by Gen Re’s underwriting prof itability.  Size simply doesn’t\ncount.\nFinally, we are making every effort to get our reserving right.  If we fail at that, we can’t know our\ntrue costs.  And any insurer that has no idea  what its costs are is heading for big trouble.\n\n9At yearend 2001, General Re attempted to reserve adequately for all losses that had occurred prior to\nthat date and were not yet paid – but we failed badl y.  Therefore the company’ s 2002 underwriting results\nwere penalized by an additional $1.31 billion that we re corded to correct the estimation mistakes of earlier\nyears.  When I review the reserving errors that have been uncovered at General Re, a line from a country song\nseems apt: “I wish I didn’t kno w now what I didn’t know then.”\nI can promise you that our top priority going forward is to avoid inadequate reserving.  But I can’t\nguarantee success.  The natural tendency of most casualty-insurance managers is to underreserve, and they\nmust have a particular mindset – which, it may surprise you, has nothing to do with actuarial expertise – if\nthey are to overcome this devastating bias.  Additiona lly, a reinsurer faces far more difficulties in reserving\nproperly than does a primar y insurer.  Nevertheless, at Berkshire, we have generally been successful in our\nreserving, and we are determined to be at General Re as well.\nIn summary, I believe General Re is now well pos itioned to deliver huge am ounts of no-cost float to\nBerkshire and that its sink-the-ship catastrophe risk has been eliminated.  The company still possesses the\nimportant competitive strengths that I’ve outlined in the past.  And it gained another highly significantadvantage last year when each of  its three largest worldwide competitors, previously rated AAA, was\ndemoted by at least one rating agency.  Among the giants, General Re, rated AAA across-the-board, is now in\na class by itself in respect to financial strength.\nNo attribute is more important.  Recently, in cont rast, one of the world’s largest reinsurers – a\ncompany regularly recommended to primary insurers by  leading brokers – has all but ceased paying claims,\nincluding those both valid and due.  This company owes many billions of dollars to hundreds of primaryinsurers who now face massive write-offs.  “Cheap” reinsura nce is a fool’s bargain: When an insurer lays out\nmoney today in exchange for a reinsurer’s promise to pay a decade or two later, it’s dangerous – and possibly\nlife-threatening – for the insurer to deal with any but the strongest reinsurer around.\nBerkshire shareholders owe Joe and Tad a huge th ank you for their accomplishments in 2002.  They\nworked harder during the year than I would wish for anyone – and it is paying off.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAt GEICO, everything went so well in 2002 that we should pinch ourselves.  Growth was\nsubstantial, profits were outstanding, policyhol der retention was up and sales productivity jumped\nsignificantly.  These trends continue in early 2003.\nThank Tony Nicely for all of this.  As anyone who knows him will attest, Tony has been in love with\nGEICO for 41 years – ever since he went to work for th e company at 18 – and his results reflect this passion.\nHe is proud of the money we save policyholders – abou t $1 billion annually versus what other insurers, on\naverage, would have charged them.  He is proud of the service we provide these policyholders: In a key\nindustry survey, GEICO was recently ranked above all major competitors.  He is proud of his 19,162associates, who last year were awarded profit-sharing pa yments equal to 19% of their base salary because of\nthe splendid results they achieved.  And he is proud of the growing profits he delivers to Berkshire\nshareholders.\nGEICO took in $2.9 billion in premiums when Berkshire acquired full ownership in 1996.  Last\nyear, its volume was $6.9 billion, with plenty of grow th to come.  Particularly promising is the company’s\nInternet operation, whose new business grew by 75% last year.  Check us out at GEICO.com (or call 800-847-7536).  In most states, shareholders get a special 8% discount.\nHere’s one footnote to GEICO’s 2002 earnings that underscores the need for insurers to do business\nwith only the strongest of reinsurers.  In 1981-1983, the managers then running GEICO decided to try theirhand at writing commercial umbrella and product liability  insurance.  The risks seemed modest: the company\ntook in only $3,051,000 from this line and used almost all of it – $2,979,000 – to buy reinsurance in order to\nlimit its losses.  GEICO was left with a paltry $72,000 as compensation for the minor portion of the risk that\nit retained.  But this small bite of the apple was more than enough to make the experience memorable.\nGEICO’s losses from this venture now total a breathtaking $94.1 million  or about 130,000% of the net\npremium it received.  Of the total loss, uncollectable r eceivables from deadbeat reinsurers account for no less\nthan $90.3 million (including $19 million charged in 2002).  So much for “cheap” reinsurance.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n10Ajit Jain’s reinsurance division was the major reason our float cost us so little last year.  If we ever\nput a photo in a Berkshire annual report, it will be of Ajit.  In color!\nAjit’s operation has amassed $13.4 billion of float, more than all but a handful of insurers have ever\nbuilt up.  He accomplished this from a standing start in 1986, and even now has a workforce numbering only\n20.  And, most important, he has produced underwriting profits.\nHis profits are particularly remark able if you factor in some accoun ting arcana that I am about to lay\non you.  So prepare to eat your spinach (or, alternatively,  if debits and credits aren’t your thing, skip the next\ntwo paragraphs).\nAjit’s 2002 underwriting profit of $534 million came after  his operation recognized a charge of $428\nmillion attributable to “retroactive” insurance he has wr itten over the years.  In this line of business, we\nassume from another insurer the obligation to pay up to a specified amount for losses they have already\nincurred – often for events that took place decades earlier – but that are yet to be paid (for example, because a\nworker hurt in 1980 will receive monthl y payments for life).  In  these arrangements, an insurer pays us a large\nupfront premium, but one that is less  than the losses we expect to pay.   We willingly accept this differential\nbecause a) our payments are capped, and b) we get to use the money until loss payments are actually made,\nwith these often stretching out ov er a decade or more.  About 80% of  the $6.6 billion in asbestos and\nenvironmental loss reserves that we carry arises fr om capped contracts, whose costs consequently can’t\nskyrocket.\nWhen we write a retroactive policy, we immediatel y record both the premiu m and a reserve for the\nexpected losses.  The difference between the two is  entered as an asset entitled “deferred charges –\nreinsurance assumed.”  This is no small item: at year end, for all retroactive policies, it was $3.4 billion.  We\nthen amortize this asset downward by charges to income  over the expected life of each policy.  These charges\n– $440 million in 2002, including charges at Gen Re – create an underwriting loss, but one that is intentional\nand desirable.  And even after this drag on reported re sults, Ajit achieved a large underwriting gain last year.\nWe want to emphasize, however, that we assu me risks in Ajit’s oper ation that are huge – far larger\nthan those retained by any other insurer in the world.   Therefore, a single event could cause a major swing in\nAjit’s results in any given quarter or ye ar.  That bothers us not at all: As long as we are paid appropriately, we\nlove taking on short-term volatility that others wish to shed.  At Berkshire, we would rather earn a lumpy\n15% over time than a smooth 12%.\nIf you see Ajit at our annu al meeting, bow deeply.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nBerkshire’s smaller insurers had an outstanding y ear.  Their aggregate float grew by 38%, and they\nrealized an underwriting profit of $3 2 million, or 4.5% of premiums.  Collectively, these operations would\nmake one of the finest insurance companies in the country.\nIncluded in these figures, however, were terrible  results in our California workers’ compensation\noperation.  There, we have work to do.  There, too,  our reserving severely missed the mark.  Until we figure\nout how to get this business right, we will keep it small.\nFor the fabulous year they had in 2002, we thank Rod Eldred, John Kizer, Tom Nerney, Don Towle\nand Don Wurster.  They added a lot of value to your Berkshire investment.\nSources of Reported Earnings\nThe table that follows shows the main sources of Berkshire’s reported earnings.  You will notice that\n“Purchase-Accounting Adjustments” dr opped sharply in 2002, the reason  being that GAAP rules changed\nthen, no longer requiring the amortization of goodwill.  This change increases our reported earnings, but has\nno effect on our economic earnings.\n\n11(in millions)\nBerkshire’s Share\nof Net Earnings\n(after taxes and\nPre-Tax Earnings Minority interests)\n2002 2001 2002 2001\nOperating Earnings:\nInsurance Group:\nUnderwriting – General Re.................................... $(1,393) $(3,671) $(930) $(2,391)\nUnderwriting – Berkshire Group ........................... 534 (647) 347 (433)\nUnderwriting – GEICO.......................................... 416 221 271 144Underwriting – Other Primary............................... 32 30 20 18\nNet Investment Income .......................................... 3,050 2,824 2,096 1,968\nApparel\n(1).................................................................. 229 (33) 156 (28)\nBuilding Products(2).................................................. 516 461 313 287\nFinance and Financial Produc ts Business................. 1,016 519 659 336\nFlight Services .......................................................... 225 186 133 105\nMidAmerican Energy (80% owned)......................... 613 565 359 230Retail Operations ...................................................... 166 175 97 101\nScott Fetzer (excluding fi nance operation)............... 129 129 83 83\nShaw Industries\n(3)...................................................... 424 292 258 156\nOther Businesses ....................................................... 256 212 160 131\nPurchase-Accounting Adjust ments...........................

Most of the\nincrease, both present an d expected, results from the acquisitions described earlier.  To fund these,\nBerkshire purchased $1,273 million of MidAmerican junior debt (bringing our total holdings of\nthese 11% obligations to $1,728 million) and also invested $402 million in a “common-equivalent”\nstock.  We now own (on a fully-diluted basis) 80.2% of MidAmerican’s equity.  MidAmerican’s\nfinancial statements are presented in detail on page 37.\n• Last year I told you of the problems at Dexter that led to a huge loss in our shoe business.  Thanks to\nFrank Rooney and Jim Issler of H.H. Brown, the Dexter operation has been turned around.  Despite\nthe cost of unwinding our problems there, we earned $24 million in shoes last year, an upward swing\nof $70 million from 2001.\nRandy Watson at Justin also contributed to this improvement, increasing margins significantly while\ntrimming invested capital.  Shoes are a tough business, but we have terrific managers and believe\nthat in the future we will earn reasonable returns on the capital we employ in this operation.\n\n12• In a so-so year for home-furnishing and jewelry retailers, our operations did well.  Among our eight\nretailing operations, the best performer was Homemaker’s in Des Moines.  There, the talented\nMerschman family achieved outstanding gains in both sales and profits.\nNebraska Furniture Mart will open a new blockbus ter store in metropolitan Kansas City in August.\nWith 450,000 square feet of retail space, it coul d well produce the second largest volume of any\nfurniture store in the country – the Omaha operation being the national champion.  I hope Berkshireshareholders in the Kansas City area will come out for the opening (and keep coming).\n• Our home and construction-related businesses – Acme Brick, Benjamin Moore Paint, Johns-\nManville, MiTek and Shaw – delivered $941 million of pre-tax earnings last year.  Of particular\nsignificance was Shaw’s gain from $292 million in 2001 to $424 million.  Bob Shaw and Julian Saul\nare terrific operators.  Carpet pr ices increased only 1% last year , but Shaw’s productivity gains and\nexcellent expense control delivered significantly improved margins.\nWe cherish cost-consciousness at Berkshire.  Our model is the widow who went to the local\nnewspaper to place an obituary notice.  Told th ere was a 25-cents-a-word charge, she requested\n“Fred Brown died.”  She was then informed th ere was a seven-word minimum.  “Okay” the\nbereaved woman replied, “make it ‘Fred Brown died, golf clubs for sale’.”\n• Earnings from flight services increased last year  – but only because we realized a special pre-tax\ngain of $60 million from the sale of our 50% interest in FlightSafety Boeing.  Without this gain,\nearnings from our training business would have fallen slightly in concert with the slowdown in\nbusiness-aviation activity.  FlightSafety training continues to be the gold standard for the industry,and we expect growth in the years to come.\nAt NetJets, our fractional-ownership operation, we are the runaway leader of the four-company field.\nFAA records indicate that our in dustry share in 2002 was 75%, meaning that clients purchased or\nleased planes from us that were valued at triple those recorded by our three competitors combined .\nLast year, our fleet flew 132.7 million nautical miles, taking clients to 130 countries.\nOur preeminence is directly attributable to Rich Sa ntulli, NetJets’ CEO.  He invented the business in\n1986 and ever since has exhibited an unbending devotion to the highest levels of service, safety and\nsecurity.  Rich, Charlie and I insist on planes (a nd personnel) worthy of carrying our own families –\nbecause they regularly do.\nThough NetJets revenues set a reco rd in 2002, the company again lost money.  A small profit in the\nU.S. was more than offset by losses in Europe .  Overall, the fractional-ownership industry lost\nsignificant sums last year, and that is almost certain to be the outcome in 2003 as well.  The bald fact\nis that airplanes are costly to operate.\nOver time, this economic reality should work to  our advantage, given that for a great many\ncompanies, private aircraft are an essential business  tool.  And for most of these companies, NetJets\nmakes compelling sense as either a primary or s upplementary supplier of th e aircraft they need.\nMany businesses could save millions of dollars a nnually by flying with us.  Indeed, the yearly\nsavings at some large companies could exceed $10  million.  Equally important, these companies\nwould actually increase their operational capabilities by using us.  A fractional ownership of a single\nNetJets plane allows a client to have several planes in the air simultaneously.  Additionally, throughthe interchange arrangement we make available, an owner of an interest in one plane can fly any of\n12 other models, using whatever plane makes most sense for a mission.  (One of my sisters owns a\nfraction of a Falcon 2000, which she uses for trips to Hawaii, but – exhibiting the Buffett gene – she\ninterchanges to a more economical Citation Excel for short trips in the U.S.)\nThe roster of NetJets users confirms the advant ages we offer major businesses.  Take General\nElectric, for example.  It has a large fleet of its  own but also has an unsurpassed knowledge of how\nto utilize aircraft effectively and economically.  And it is our largest customer.\n• Our finance and financial products line covers a variety of operations, among them certain activities\nin high-grade fixed-income securities that proved hi ghly profitable in 2002.  Earnings in this arena\nwill probably continue for a while, but are certain  to decrease – and perhaps disappear – in time.\n\n13This category also includes a highly satisfactory – but rapidly diminishing – income stream from our\nBerkadia investment in Finova (described in last year’s report).  Our partner, Leucadia National\nCorp., has managed this operation with great skill,  willingly doing far more than its share of the\nheavy lifting.  I like this division of labor and hop e to join with Leucadia in future transactions.\nOn the minus side, the Finance line also includes the operations of General Re Securities, a\nderivatives and trading business.  This entity  lost $173 million pre-tax last year, a result that, in part,\nis a belated acknowledgment of faulty, albeit st andard, accounting it used in earlier periods.\nDerivatives, in fact, deserve an extensive look, both in respect to the accounting their users employ\nand to the problems they may pose for both individual companies and our economy.\nDerivatives\nCharlie and I are of one mind in how we feel about derivatives and the trading activities that go with\nthem: We view them as time bombs, both for the par ties that deal in them and the economic system.\nHaving delivered that thought, which I’ll get back to, let me retreat to explaining derivatives, though\nthe explanation must be general because the word covers  an extraordinarily wide range of financial contracts.\nEssentially, these instruments call for money to change hands at some future date, with the amount to be\ndetermined by one or more reference items, such as inte rest rates, stock prices or currency values.  If, for\nexample, you are either long or short an S&P 500 futures contract, you are a party to a very simple derivatives\ntransaction – with your gain or loss derived  from movements in the index.  Derivatives contracts are of\nvarying duration (running sometimes to 20 or more year s) and their value is often tied to several variables.\nUnless derivatives contracts are collateralized or gua ranteed, their ultimate value also depends on the\ncreditworthiness of the counterparties to them.  In th e meantime, though, before a contract is settled, the\ncounterparties record profits and losses – often huge in amount – in their current earnings statements withoutso much as a penny changing hands.\nThe range of derivatives contracts is limited only by the imagination of man (or sometimes, so it\nseems, madmen).  At Enron, for example, newsprint and broadband derivatives, due to be settled many years\nin the future, were put on the books.  Or say you want to write a contract speculating on the number of twins\nto be born in Nebraska in 2020.  No problem – at a price, you will easily find an obliging counterparty.\nWhen we purchased Gen Re, it came with General Re  Securities, a derivatives dealer that Charlie\nand I didn’t want, judging it to be dangerous.  We fa iled in our attempts to sell the operation, however, and\nare now terminating it.\nBut closing down a derivatives business is easier said  than done.  It will be a great many years before\nwe are totally out of this operation (though we redu ce our exposure daily).  In fact, the reinsurance and\nderivatives businesses are similar: Like Hell, both are easy to enter and almost impossible to exit.  In either\nindustry, once you write a contract – which may require a large payment decades later – you are usually stuck\nwith it.  True, there are methods by which the risk can be laid off with others.  But most strategies of that kind\nleave you with residual liability.\nAnother commonality of reinsurance and derivatives is that both generate reported earnings that are\noften wildly overstated.  That’s tr ue because today’s earnings are in a significant way based on estimates\nwhose inaccuracy may not be exposed for many years.\nErrors will usually be honest, reflecting only the hum an tendency to take an optimistic view of one’s\ncommitments.  But the parties to derivatives also have enormous incentives to cheat in accounting for them.\nThose who trade derivatives are usua lly paid (in whole or part) on “ear nings” calculated by mark-to-market\naccounting.  But often there is no r eal market (think about our contract  involving twins) and “mark-to-model”\nis utilized.  This substitution can bring on large-scale mischief.  As a general rule, contracts involving\nmultiple reference items and distant settlement date s increase the opportunities for counterparties to use\nfanciful assumptions.  In the twins scenario, for exam ple, the two parties to the contract might well use\ndiffering models allowing both to show substantial profits for many years.  In extreme cases, mark-to-model\ndegenerates into what I would call mark-to-myth.\nOf course, both internal and outside auditors review the numbers, but that’s no easy job.  For\nexample, General Re Securities at yearend (after te n months of winding down its operation) had 14,384\n\n14contracts outstanding, involving 672 counterparties around the world.  Each contract had a plus or minus\nvalue derived from one or more reference items, including some of mind-boggling complexity.  Valuing a\nportfolio like that, expert auditors could easily and honestly have widely varying opinions.\nThe valuation problem is far from academic: In r ecent years, some huge-scale frauds and near-frauds\nhave been facilitated by derivatives trades.  In the energy and electric utility sectors, for example, companies\nused derivatives and trading activities to report great “earnings” – until the roof fell in when they actually\ntried to convert the derivatives-related receivables on their balance sheets into ca sh.  “Mark-to-market” then\nturned out to be truly “mark-to-myth.”\nI can assure you that the marking errors in the derivatives business have not been symmetrical.\nAlmost invariably, they have favored either the tr ader who was eyeing a multi-million dollar bonus or the\nCEO who wanted to report impressi ve “earnings” (or both).  The bonu ses were paid, and the CEO profited\nfrom his options.  Only much later did shareholde rs learn that the reported earnings were a sham.\nAnother problem about derivatives is that they can exacerbate trouble that a corporation has run into\nfor completely unrelated reasons.  This pile-on effect o ccurs because many derivatives contracts require that a\ncompany suffering a credit downgrade im mediately supply collateral to counterparties.  Imagine, then, that a\ncompany is downgraded because of general adversity and that its derivatives instantly kick in with their\nrequirement, imposing an unexpected and enormous de mand for cash collateral on th e company.  The need to\nmeet this demand can then throw the company into a liquidity crisis that may, in some cases, trigger still more\ndowngrades.  It all becomes a spiral that can lead to a corporate meltdown.\nDerivatives also create a daisy-chain risk that is akin to the risk run by insurers or reinsurers that lay\noff much of their business with othe rs.  In both cases, huge receivabl es from many counterparties tend to\nbuild up over time.  (At Gen Re Se curities, we still have $6.5 billion of  receivables, though we’ve been in a\nliquidation mode for nearly a year.)  A participant may see himself as prudent, believing his large creditexposures to be diversified and therefore not dangerous.  Under certain circumstances, though, an exogenous\nevent that causes the receivable from Company A to go  bad will also affect those from Companies B through\nZ.  History teaches us that a crisis often causes pr oblems to correlate in a manner undreamed of in more\ntranquil times.\nIn banking, the recognition of a “linkage” problem was one of the reasons for the formation of the\nFederal Reserve System.  Before the Fed was established, the failure of weak banks would sometimes putsudden and unanticipated liquidity demands on previously-strong banks, causing them to fail in turn.  The\nFed now insulates the strong from the troubles of the weak .  But there is no central bank assigned to the job of\npreventing the dominoes toppling in insurance or derivatives.  In these industries, firms that are\nfundamentally solid can become troubled simply because  of the travails of other firms further down the chain.\nWhen a “chain reaction” threat exists within an industry, it pays to minimize links of any kind.  That’s how\nwe conduct our reinsurance business, and it’s one reason we are exiting derivatives.\nMany people argue that derivatives reduce systemic problems, in that participants who can’t bear\ncertain risks are able to transfer them to stronger hands .  These people believe that derivatives act to stabilize\nthe economy, facilitate trade, and eliminate bumps for i ndividual participants.  And, on a micro level, what\nthey say is often true.  Indeed, at Berkshire, I some times engage in large-scale derivatives transactions in\norder to facilitate certain investment strategies.\nCharlie and I believe, however, that the macro pi cture is dangerous and getting more so.  Large\namounts of risk, particularly credit risk, have become concentrated in the hands of relatively few derivatives\ndealers, who in addition trade extensively with one other.   The troubles of one could quickly infect the others.\nOn top of that, these dealers are owed huge amounts by non-dealer counterparties.  Some of these\ncounterparties, as I’ve mentioned, are linked in ways that could cause them to contemporaneously run into a\nproblem because of a single event (such as the implosio n of the telecom industry or  the precipitous decline in\nthe value of merchant power project s).  Linkage, when it suddenly su rfaces, can trigger serious systemic\nproblems.\nIndeed, in 1998, the leveraged and derivatives-heavy activities of a single hedge fund, Long-Term\nCapital Management, caused the Federal Reserve anxieties so severe that it hastily orchestrated a rescue\neffort.  In later Congressional testimony, Fed officials acknowledged that, had they not intervened, the\noutstanding trades of LTCM – a firm unknown to the general public and employing only a few hundred\n\n15people – could well have posed a serious threat to the st ability of American markets.  In other words, the Fed\nacted because its leaders were fearful of what might have happened to other financial institutions had the\nLTCM domino toppled. And this affair, though it para lyzed many parts of the fixed-income market for\nweeks, was far from a worst-case scenario.\nOne of the derivatives instruments that LTCM used  was total-return swaps, contracts that facilitate\n100% leverage in various markets, including stocks.  For example, Party A to a contract, usually a bank, putsup all of the money for the purchase of a stock while Pa rty B, without putting up any capital, agrees that at a\nfuture date it will receive any gain or  pay any loss that the bank realizes.\nTotal-return swaps of this type make a joke of margin requirements.  Beyond that, other types of\nderivatives severely curtail the ability of regulators to curb leverage and generally get their arms around the\nrisk profiles of banks, insurers and other financial in stitutions.  Similarly, even experienced investors and\nanalysts encounter major problems in analyzing the financial condition of firms that are heavily involved with\nderivatives contracts.  When Charlie and I finish read ing the long footnotes detailing the derivatives activities\nof major banks, the only thing we understand is that we don’t  understand how much risk the institution is\nrunning.\nThe derivatives genie is now well out of the bottle, and these instruments will almost certainly\nmultiply in variety and number until some event make s their toxicity clear.  Knowledge of how dangerous\nthey are has already permeated the electricity and ga s businesses, in which the eruption of major troubles\ncaused the use of derivatives to diminish dramatically.  Elsewhere, however, the derivatives business\ncontinues to expand unchecked.  Central banks and governments have so far found no effective way tocontrol, or even monitor, the risks posed by these contracts.\nCharlie and I believe Berkshire should be a fortress of financial strength – for the sake of our\nowners, creditors, policyholders and employees.  We try to  be alert to any sort of megacatastrophe risk, and\nthat posture may make us unduly apprehensive about the burgeoning quantities of long-term derivatives\ncontracts and the massive amount of uncollateralized receivables that ar e growing alongside.  In our view,\nhowever, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, arepotentially lethal.\nInvestments\nBelow we show our common stock investments.  Those that had a market value of more than $500\nmillion at the end of 2002 are  itemized.\n12/31/02\nShares\nCompany Cost Market\n(dollars in millions)\n151,610,700 American Express Co mpany ..................................................................... $  1,470 $  5,359\n200,000,000 The Coca-Cola  Company .......................................................................... 1,299 8,768\n96,000,000 The Gillette  Company................................................................................ 600 2,915\n15,999,200 H&R Bloc k, Inc......................................................................................... 255 643\n6,708,760 M&T Bank................................................................................................. 103 532\n24,000,000 Moody’s Co rporation ................................................................................. 499 991\n1,727,765 The Washington Post Company ................................................................ 11 1,275\n53,265,080 Wells Fargo & Company........................................................................... 306 2,497\nOthers ........................................................................................................     4,621     5,383\nTotal Common St ocks ............................................................................... $9,164 $28,363\nWe continue to do little in equities.  Charlie and I are increasingly comfortable with our holdings in\nBerkshire’s major investees because most of them have  increased their earnings wh ile their valuations have\ndecreased.  But we are not inclined to add to them.  Though these enterprises have good prospects, we don’t\nyet believe their shares are undervalued.\nIn our view, the same conclusion fits stocks generally.  Despite three years of falling prices, which\nhave significantly improved the attrac tiveness of common stocks, we still find very few that even mildly\n\n16interest us.  That dismal fact is testimony to the in sanity of valuations reached  during The Great Bubble.\nUnfortunately, the hangover may prove to be proportional to the binge.\nThe aversion to equities that Charlie and I exhibit today is far from congenital.  We love owning\ncommon stocks – if they can be purchased at attractive prices.  In my 61 years of investing, 50 or so years\nhave offered that kind of opportunity.  There will be years like that again.  Unless, however, we see a very\nhigh probability of at least 10% pre-tax returns (which translate to 6½-7% after co rporate tax), we will sit on\nthe sidelines.  With short-term money returning less than 1% after-tax, sitting it out is no fun.  But\noccasionally successful inve sting requires inactivity.\nLast year we were, however, able to make sensible investments in a few “junk” bonds and loans.\nOverall, our commitments in this sector sextupled, reaching $8.3 billion by yearend.\nInvesting in junk bonds and investing in stocks are alike in certain ways: Both activities require us to\nmake a price-value calculation and also to scan hundreds of  securities to find the very few that have attractive\nreward/risk ratios.  But there are important differences  between the two disciplines as well.  In stocks, we\nexpect every commitment to  work out well because we concentrate on conservatively financed businesses\nwith strong competitive strengths, run by able and honest people.  If we buy into these companies at sensible\nprices, losses should be rare.  Indeed, during the 38 years we have run the company’s affairs, gains from the\nequities we manage at Berkshire (that is, excluding t hose managed at General Re and GEICO) have exceeded\nlosses by a ratio of about 100 to one.\nPurchasing junk bonds, we are dealing with enterpri ses that are far more marginal.  These businesses\nare usually overloaded with debt and often operate in  industries characterized by low returns on capital.\nAdditionally, the quality of management is sometimes questionable.  Management may even have interests\nthat are directly counter to those of  debtholders.  Therefore, we expect  that we will have occasional large\nlosses in junk issues.  So far, however, we  have done reasonably well in this field.\nCorporate Governance\nBoth the ability and fidelity of managers have long needed monitoring.  Indeed, nearly 2,000 years\nago, Jesus Christ addressed this subject, speaking (Luk e 16:2) approvingly of “a certain rich man” who told\nhis manager, “Give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest no longer be steward.”\nAccountability and stewardship withered in th e last decade, becoming qualities deemed of little\nimportance by those caught up in the Great Bubble.  As stock prices went up, the behavioral norms ofmanagers went down.  By the late ’90s, as a result, CE Os who traveled the high road did not encounter heavy\ntraffic.\nMost CEOs, it should be noted, are men and women you would be happy to have as trustees for your\nchildren’s assets or as next-door neighbors.  Too many of these people, however, have in recent years\nbehaved badly at the office, fudging numbers and drawing obscene pay for mediocre business achievements.These otherwise decent people simply followed the car eer path of Mae West: “I  was Snow White but I\ndrifted.”\nIn theory, corporate boards should have prevented this deterioration of conduct.  I last wrote about\nthe responsibilities of directors in the 1993 annual repor t.  (We will send you a copy of this discussion on\nrequest, or you may read it on the Internet in the Co rporate Governance section of the 1993 letter.)  There, I\nsaid that directors “should behave as if there was a single absentee owner, whose long-term interest they\nshould try to further in all proper ways.”  This means that directors must get rid of a manager who is mediocre\nor worse, no matter how likable he may be.  Directors must react as did the chorus -girl bride of an 85-year-\nold multimillionaire when he asked whether she would love him if he lost his money.  “Of course,” the youngbeauty replied, “I would miss you, but I would still love you.”\nIn the 1993 annual report, I also said directors had another job: “If able but greedy managers over-\nreach and try to dip too deeply into the shareholders’ pockets, directors mu st slap their hands.”  Since I wrote\nthat, over-reaching has become common but few hands have been slapped.\nWhy have intelligent and decent dir ectors failed so miserably?  Th e answer lies not in inadequate\nlaws – it’s always been clear that directors are obligated  to represent the interests of shareholders – but rather\nin what I’d call “boardroom atmosphere.”\n\n17It’s almost impossible, for example, in a boardroom populated by well-mannered people, to raise the\nquestion of whether the CEO should be replaced.  It ’s equally awkward to question a proposed acquisition\nthat has been endorsed by the CEO, particularly when his inside staff and outside advisors are present andunanimously support his decision.  (They wouldn’t be in the room if they didn’t.)  Finally, when the\ncompensation committee – armed, as always, with support from a high-paid consultant – reports on a\nmegagrant of options to the CEO, it would be like belching at the dinner table for a director to suggest that thecommittee reconsider.\nThese “social” difficulties argue for outside directors regularly meeting without the CEO – a reform\nthat is being instituted and that I enthusiastically e ndorse.  I doubt, however, that most of the other new\ngovernance rules and recommendations will provide bene fits commensurate with the monetary and other\ncosts they impose.\nThe current cry is for “independent” directors.  It is certainly true that it is desirable to have directors\nwho think and speak independently – but they must also be business-savvy, interested and shareholder-\noriented.  In my 1993 commentary, those ar e the three qualities I described as essential.\nOver a span of 40 years, I have been on 19 public-company boards (excluding Berkshire’s) and have\ninteracted with perhaps 250 directors.  Most of them were “independent” as defined by today’s rules.  But the\ngreat majority of these directors lacked at least one  of the three qualities I value.  As a result, their\ncontribution to shareholder well-being was minimal at best  and, too often, negative.  These people, decent and\nintelligent though they were, simply did not know enough about business and/or care enough about\nshareholders to question foolish acquisitions or egregi ous compensation.  My own behavior, I must ruefully\nadd, frequently fell short as well: Too often I was silent when management made proposals that I judged to be\ncounter to the interests of shareholders.  In those cases, collegiality trumped independence.\nSo that we may further see the failings of “indepe ndence,” let’s look at a 62-year case study covering\nthousands of companies.  Since 1940, federal law has mandated that a large proportion of the directors of\ninvestment companies (most of these mutual funds) be independent.  The requirement was originally 40% and\nnow it is 50%.  In any case, the typical fund has long operated with a majority of directors who qualify as\nindependent.\nThese directors and the entire board have many perfunctory duties, but in actuality have only two\nimportant responsibilities: obtaining the best possible investment manager and negotiating with that managerfor the lowest possible fee.  When you are seeking inve stment help yourself, those two goals are the only ones\nthat count, and directors acting for other investors should  have exactly the same priorities.  Yet when it comes\nto independent directors pursuing either goal, their record has been absolutely pathetic.\nMany thousands of investment-company boards meet annually to carry out the vital job of selecting\nwho will manage the savings of the millions of owners th ey represent.  Year after year the directors of Fund\nA select manager A, Fund B directors select manage r B, etc. … in a zombie-like process that makes a\nmockery of stewardship.  Very o ccasionally, a board will revolt.  But for the most part, a monkey will type\nout a Shakespeare play before an “independent” mutual-fu nd director will suggest that his fund look at other\nmanagers, even if the incumbent manager has persisten tly delivered substandard performance.  When they are\nhandling their own money, of course, directors will look to alternative advisors – but it never enters their\nminds to do so when they are acting as fiduciaries for others.\nThe hypocrisy permeating the system is vividly exposed when a fund management company – call it\n“A” – is sold for a huge sum to Manager “B”.  Now the “independent” directors experience a “counter-\nrevelation” and decide that Manager B is the best that can be found – even though B was available (andignored) in previous years.  Not so incidentally, B also could formerly have been hired at a far lower rate than\nis possible now that it has bought Manager A.  That’s because B has laid out a fortune to acquire A, and B\nmust now recoup that cost through fees paid by the A shareholders who were “deliv ered” as part of the deal.\n(For a terrific discussion of the mutu al fund business, read John Bogle’s Common Sense on Mutual Funds .)\nA few years ago, my daughter was asked to become a director of a family of funds managed by a\nmajor institution.  Th e fees she would have received as a direct or were very substa ntial, enough to have\nincreased her annual income by about 50% (a boost, she will tell you, she could use!).  Legally, she would\nhave been an independent director.  But did the fund manager who approached her think there was any\nchance that she would think independen tly as to what advisor the fund should employ?  Of course not.  I am\n\n18proud to say that she showed real independence by turning down the offer.  The fund, however, had no\ntrouble filling the slot (and – surprise – the fund has not changed managers).\nInvestment company directors have failed as well in negotiating management fees (just as\ncompensation committees of many Am erican companies have failed to hold the compensation of their CEOs\nto sensible levels).  If you or I were empowered, I can assure you that we could easily negotiate materially\nlower management fees with the incumbent managers of most mutual funds.  And, believe me, if directorswere promised a portion of any fee savings they reali zed, the skies would be filled with falling fees.  Under\nthe current system, though, reductions mean nothing to  “independent” directors wh ile meaning everything to\nmanagers.  So guess who wins?\nHaving the right money manager, of course, is far more important to a fund than reducing the\nmanager’s fee.  Both tasks are nonetheless the job of directors.  And in stepping up to these all-important\nresponsibilities, tens of t housands of “independent” di rectors, over more than six decades, have failed\nmiserably.  (They’ve succeeded, however, in taking care of themselves; their f ees from serving on multiple\nboards of a single “family” of funds often run well into six figures.)\nWhen the manager cares deeply and the directors don’t, what’s needed is a powerful countervailing\nforce – and that’s the missing element in today’s cor porate governance.  Getting rid of mediocre CEOs and\neliminating overreaching by the able ones requires action by owners – big owners.  The logistics aren’t that\ntough: The ownership of stock has grown increasingly concentrated in recent decades, and today it would be\neasy for institutional managers to exert their will on problem  situations.  Twenty, or even fewer, of the largest\ninstitutions, acting together, could effectively reform corporate governance at a given company, simply bywithholding their votes for directors who were tolerating odious behavior.  In my view, this kind of concerted\naction is the only way that corporate stew ardship can be meaningfully improved.\nUnfortunately, certain major investing institutions have “glass house” problems in arguing for better\ngovernance elsewhere; they would shudder, for exampl e, at the thought of their own performance and fees\nbeing closely inspected by their own boards.  But Jack Bogle of Vanguard fame, Chris Davis of Davis\nAdvisors, and Bill Miller of Legg Mason are now offeri ng leadership in getting CEOs to treat their owners\nproperly.  Pension funds, as well as other fiduciaries, will reap better investment returns in the future if they\nsupport these men.\nThe acid test for reform will be CEO compensatio n.  Managers will cheerfully agree to board\n“diversity,” attest to SEC filings and adopt meaningle ss proposals relating to process.  What many will fight,\nhowever, is a hard look at their own pay and perks.\nIn recent years compensation committees too often have been tail-wagging puppy dogs meekly\nfollowing recommendations by consultants, a breed not known for allegiance to th e faceless shareholders who\npay their fees.  (If you can’t tell w hose side someone is on, they are not on yours.)  True, each committee is\nrequired by the SEC to state its reasoning about pay in the proxy.  But the words are usually boilerplate\nwritten by the company’s lawyers or its human-relations department.\nThis costly charade should ceas e.  Directors should not serve on compensation committees unless\nthey are themselves  capable of negotiating on behalf of owners.  They should explain both how they think\nabout pay and how they measure perfo rmance.  Dealing with shareholders’ money, moreover, they should\nbehave as they would were it their own.\nIn the 1890s, Samuel Gompers described the goal  of organized labor as “More!”  In the 1990s,\nAmerica’s CEOs adopted his battle cry.  The upshot is  that CEOs have often amassed riches while their\nshareholders have experienced financial disasters.\nDirectors should stop such piracy.  There’s nothing wrong with paying well for truly exceptional\nbusiness performance.  But, for anything short of that, it’s time for directors to shout “Less!”  It would be a\ntravesty if the bloated pay of recent years became a baseline for fu ture compensation.  Compensation\ncommittees should go back to the drawing boards.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nRules that have been proposed and that are almost certain to go into effect will require changes in\nBerkshire’s board, obliging us to add directors who meet the codified requirements for “independence.”\n\n19Doing so, we will add a test that we believe is important, but far from determinative, in fostering\nindependence: We will select directors who have huge an d true ownership interests (that is, stock that they or\ntheir family have purchased , not been given by Berkshire or received via options), expecting those interests to\ninfluence their actions to a degree that dwarfs ot her considerations such as prestige and board fees.\nThat gets to an often-overlooked point about dir ectors’ compensation, whic h at public companies\naverages perhaps $50,000 annually.  It baffles me how the many directors who look to these dollars forperhaps 20% or more of their annual income can be considered independent when Ron Olson, for example,\nwho is on our board, may be deemed not independent because he receives a tiny percentage of his very large\nincome from Berkshire legal fees.  As the investment company saga suggests, a director whose moderateincome is heavily dependent on directors’ fees – and who hopes mightily to be invited to join other boards in\norder to earn more fees – is highly unlikely to offe nd a CEO or fellow directors, who in a major way will\ndetermine his reputation in corporate circles.  If regulators believe that “significant” money taints\nindependence (and it certainly can), they have ov erlooked a massive class of possible offenders.\nAt Berkshire, wanting our fees to be meaningle ss to our directors, we pay them only a pittance.\nAdditionally, not wanting to insulate our directors from any corporate disaster we might have, we don’t\nprovide them with officers’ and dir ectors’ liability insurance (an unorthodoxy that, not so incidentally, has\nsaved our shareholders many millions of dollars over the years).  Basically, we want the behavior of ourdirectors to be driven by the effect their decision s will have on their family’s net worth, not by their\ncompensation.  That’s the equation for Charlie and me as managers, and we think it’s the right one for\nBerkshire directors as well.\nTo find new directors, we will look through our sh areholders list for people who directly, or in their\nfamily, have had large Berkshire holdings – in the millions of dollars – for a long time.  Individuals making\nthat cut should automatically meet two of our tests, namely that they be interested in Berkshire andshareholder-oriented.  In our third test, we will lo ok for business savvy, a competence that is far from\ncommonplace.\nFinally, we will continue to have members of the Buffett family on the board.  They are not there to\nrun the business after I die, nor will they then receive compensation of any kind.  Th eir purpose is to ensure,\nfor both our shareholders an d managers, that Berkshire’s special cu lture will be nurtured when I’m succeeded\nby other CEOs.\nAny change we make in the composition of our board will not alter the way Charlie and I run\nBerkshire.  We will continue to emphasize substance over form in our work and waste as little time as\npossible during board meetings in show-and-tell and pe rfunctory activities.  The most important job of our\nboard is likely to be the selection of successors to Ch arlie and me, and that is a matter upon which it will\nfocus.\nThe board we have had up to now has overseen a shareholder-oriented business, consistently run in\naccord with the economic principles set forth on page s 68-74 (which I urge all new shareholders to read).\nOur goal is to obtain new directors who are equally devoted to those principles.\nThe Audit Committee\nAudit committees can’t audit. Only a company’s outside auditor can determine whether the earnings\nthat a management purports to have made are suspect.  Reforms that ignore this reality and that instead focuson the structure and charter of th e audit committee will accomplish little.\nAs we’ve discussed, far too many managers have  fudged their company’s numbers in recent years,\nusing both accounting and operational techniques that are typically legal but that nevertheless materiallymislead investors.  Frequently, auditors knew about these deceptions.  Too often, however, they remained\nsilent.  The key job of the audit committee is simply to get the auditors to divulge what they know.\nTo do this job, the committee must make sure that the auditors worry more about misleading its\nmembers than about offending management.  In recent years auditors have not felt that way.  They have\ninstead generally viewed the CEO, rather  than the shareholders or directors, as their client.  That has been a\nnatural result of day-to-day working relationships and al so of the auditors’ understanding that, no matter what\nthe book says, the CEO and CFO pay their fees and dete rmine whether they are retained for both auditing and\nother work.  The rules that have been recently instituted won’t materially change this reality.  What will break\n\n20this cozy relationship is audit committees unequivocally  putting auditors on the spot, making them understand\nthey will become liable for major monetary penalties if they don’t come forth with what they know or\nsuspect.\nIn my opinion, audit committees can  accomplish this goal by asking four questions of auditors, the\nanswers to which should be recorded and repo rted to shareholders.  These questions are:\n1. If the auditor were solely responsible for preparation of the company’s financial statements,\nwould they have in any way been prepared  differently from the manner selected by\nmanagement?  This question should cover both material and nonmaterial differences.  If the\nauditor would have done something differently, both management’s argument and theauditor’s response should be disclosed.  The audit committee should then evaluate the facts.\n2. If the auditor were an investor, would he have  received – in plain English – the information\nessential to his understanding the company’s financial performance during the reporting\nperiod?\n3. Is the company following the same internal audit procedure that would be followed if the\nauditor himself were CEO?  If not, what are the differences and why?\n4. Is the auditor aware of any actions – either accounting or operational – that have had the\npurpose and effect of moving revenues or expenses from one reporting period to another?\nIf the audit committee asks these questions, its composition – the focus of most reforms – is of minor\nimportance.  In addition, the procedure will save time a nd expense.  When auditors are put on the spot, they\nwill do their duty.  If they are not put on the spot . . . well, we have seen the results of that.\nThe questions we have enumerated should be aske d at least a week before an earnings report is\nreleased to the public.  That timing will allow differences between the auditors and management to be aired\nwith the committee and resolved.  If the timing is tight er – if an earnings release is imminent when the\nauditors and committee interact – the committee will feel pressure to rubberstamp the prepared figures.  Haste\nis the enemy of accuracy.  My thinking, in fact, is that  the SEC’s recent shortening  of reporting deadlines will\nhurt the quality of information that shareholders receive.  Charlie and I believe that rule is a mistake and\nshould be rescinded.\nThe primary advantage of our four questions is th at they will act as a prophylactic.  Once the\nauditors know that the audit committee will require them to affirmatively endorse, rather than merelyacquiesce to, management’s actions, they will resist misdoings early in the process, well before specious\nfigures become embedded in the company’s books. Fear of the plaintiff’s bar will see to that.\n * * * * * * * * * * * *\nThe Chicago Tribune ran a four-part series on Arthur Andersen last September that did a great job of\nilluminating how accounting standards and audit quality ha ve eroded in recent years.  A few decades ago, an\nArthur Andersen audit opinion was the gold standard of the profession.  Within the firm, an elite Professional\nStandards Group (PSG) insisted on honest reporting, no matter what pressures were applied by the client.\nSticking to these principles, the PSG took a stand in 1992 that the cost of stock options should be recorded asthe expense it clearly was.  The PSG’s position was re versed, however, by the “rainmaking” partners of\nAndersen who knew what their clients wanted – higher  reported earnings no matter what the reality.  Many\nCEOs also fought expensing because they knew that the obscene megagrants of options they craved would beslashed if the true costs of these had to be recorded.\nSoon after the Andersen reversal, the independent accounting standards board (FASB) voted 7-0 for\nexpensing options.  Predictably, the major auditing firms and an army of CEOs stormed Washington to\npressure the Senate – what better in stitution to decide accoun ting questions? – into castrating the FASB.  The\nvoices of the protesters were amplified by their larg e political contributions, usually made with corporate\nmoney belonging to the very owners about to be bamboozled.  It was not a sight for a civics class.\nTo its shame, the Senate voted 88-9 against expensing.  Several prominent Senators even called for\nthe demise of the FASB if it didn’t abandon its position.   (So much for independence .)  Arthur Levitt, Jr., then\nChairman of the SEC – and generally a vigilant champion of shareholders – has since described his reluctant\n\n21bowing to Congressional and corporate pressures as the act of his chairman ship that he most regrets.  (The\ndetails of this sordid affair are related in Levitt’s excellent book, Take on the  Street .)\nWith the Senate in its pocket and the SEC out gunned, corporate America knew that it was now boss\nwhen it came to accounting.  With that, a new era of anything-goes earnings reports – blessed and, in some\ncases, encouraged by big-name auditors – was launched.  The licentious behavior that followed quickly\nbecame an air pump for The Great Bubble.\nAfter being threatened by the Senate, FASB back ed off its original position and adopted an “honor\nsystem” approach, declaring expensing to be preferable but  also allowing companies to ignore the cost if they\nwished.  The disheartening result: Of the 500 companies in the S&P, 498 adopted the method deemed lessdesirable, which of course let them report hi gher “earnings.”  Compensation-hungry CEOs loved this\noutcome: Let FASB have the honor; they had the system.\nIn our 1992 annual report, discussing the unseemly and self-serving behavior of so many CEOs, I\nsaid “the business elite risks losing its credibility on issues of significance to society – about which it may\nhave much of value to say – when it advocates the incredible on issues of significance to itself.”\nThat loss of credibility has occurred.  The job of CE Os is now to regain America’s trust – and for the\ncountry’s sake it’s important that th ey do so.  They will not succeed in  this endeavor, however, by way of\nfatuous ads, meaningless policy stat ements, or structural changes of boards and committees.  Instead, CEOs\nmust embrace stewardship as a way of life and treat their owners as partners, not patsies.  It’s time for CEOs\nto walk the walk.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThree suggestions for investors: First, beware of companies displaying weak accounting.  If a\ncompany still does not expense options, or if its pe nsion assumptions are fanciful, watch out.  When\nmanagements take the low road in aspects that are visible, it is likely they are following a similar path behindthe scenes.  There is seldom just one cockroach in the kitchen.\nTrumpeting EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is a particularly\npernicious practice.  Doing so implies that depreciation is not truly an expense, given that it is a “non-cash”charge.  That’s nonsense.  In truth,  depreciation is a particularly unattr active expense because the cash outlay\nit represents is paid up front, before the asset acquired  has delivered any benefits to the business.  Imagine, if\nyou will, that at the beginning of this year a company paid all of its employees for the next ten years of theirservice (in the way they would lay out cash for a fixed asset to be useful for ten years).  In the following nine\nyears, compensation would be a “non-cash” expens e – a reduction of a prepaid compensation asset\nestablished this year.  Would anyone care to argue that the recording of the expense in years two through ten\nwould be simply a bookkeeping formality?\nSecond, unintelligible footnotes usually indicate untrustworthy management.  If you can’t\nunderstand a footnote or other managerial explanation, it’s usually because the CEO doesn’t want you to.\nEnron’s descriptions of certain transactions still baffle me.\nFinally, be suspicious of companies that trumpet earnings projections and growth expectations.\nBusinesses seldom operate in a tranquil, no-surprise environment, and earnings simply don’t advance\nsmoothly (except, of course, in the offering books of investment bankers).\nCharlie and I not only don’t know today what our businesses will earn next year  – we don’t even\nknow what they will earn next quarter .  We are suspicious of those CEOs  who regularly claim they do know\nthe future – and we become downright incredulous if they consistently reach  their declared targets.  Managers\nthat always promise to “make the numbers” will at some point be tempted to make  up the numbers.\nShareholder-Designated Contributions\nAbout 97.3% of all eligible sh ares participated in Berkshir e's 2002 shareholder-designated\ncontributions program, with contributions totaling $16.5 million.\nCumulatively, over the 22 years of the program, Berkshire has made contributions of $197 million\npursuant to the instructions of our shareholders.  The rest of Berkshire's giving is done by our subsidiaries,\nwhich stick to the philanthropic patterns that prevaile d before they were acquired (except that their former\n\n22owners themselves take on the responsibility for their pe rsonal charities).  In aggregate, our subsidiaries made\ncontributions of $24 million in 2002, including in-kind donations of $4 million.\nTo participate in future programs, you must own Class A shares that are registered in the name of\nthe actual owner, not the nominee name of a broker, bank or depository.  Shares not so registered on August\n31, 2003 will be ineligible for the 2003 program.  Wh en you get the contributions form from us, return it\npromptly so that it does not get put aside or forgotten.  Designations received after the due date will not be\nhonored.\nThe Annual Meeting\nThis year’s annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 3, and once again we will be at the Civic\nAuditorium.  The doors will open at 7 a.m., the movie will begin at 8:30, and the meeting itself will\ncommence at 9:30.  There will be a short break at noon fo r food.  (Sandwiches will be available at the Civic’s\nconcession stands.)  That interlude aside, Charlie an d I will answer questions until 3:30.  Give us your best\nshot.\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car\nreservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  They do a\nterrific job for us each year , and I thank them for it.\nIn our usual fashion, we will run vans from the la rger hotels to the meeti ng.  Afterwards, the vans\nwill make trips back to the hotels and to Nebraska Furniture Mart, Borsheim’s and the airport.  Even so, you\nare likely to find a car useful.\nOur exhibit area for Berkshire goods and services will be bigger and better than ever this year.  So be\nprepared to spend .  I think you will particularly enjoy visitin g The Pampered Chef display, where you may\nrun into Doris and Sheila.\nGEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of\nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes .  In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a\nspecial shareholder discount (usually 8%).  This special offer is permitted by 41 of the 49 jurisdictions inwhich we operate.  Bring the details of your existin g insurance and check out whether we can save you\nmoney.\nOn Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have th e usual array of aircraft from NetJets® available\nfor your inspection.  Just ask a representative at the Civic about viewing any of these planes.  If you buy what\nwe consider an appropriate number of items during the weekend, you may well need your own plane to take\nthem home.  Furthermore, if you buy a fraction of a plane, I’ll personally see th at you get a three-pack of\nbriefs from Fruit of the Loom.\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, lo cated on a 77-acre site on 72\nnd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we\nwill again be having “Berkshire Weekend” pricing, which means we will be offering our shareholders a\ndiscount that is customarily given only to employees.  We initiated this special pricing at NFM six years ago,\nand sales during the “Weekend” grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $14.2 million in 2002.\nTo get the discount, you must make your purchases during the Thursday, May 1 through Monday,\nMay 5 period and also present your m eeting credential.  The period’s speci al pricing will even apply to the\nproducts of several prestigious manufacturers that nor mally have ironclad rules against discounting but that,\nin the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you.  We appreciate their cooperation.\nNFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and 10  a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sundays.   On Saturday this year,\nfrom 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., we are having a special affair for shareholders only.  I’ll be there, eating hot dogs anddrinking Coke.\nBorsheim’s  the largest jewelry store in the country except for Tiffany’s Manhattan store  will\nhave two shareholder-only events.  The first will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday,\nMay 2.  The second, the main gala, will be from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday, May 4.  Ask Charlie to\nautograph your sales ticket .\nShareholder prices will be available Thursday thro ugh Monday, so if you wish to avoid the large\ncrowds that will assemble on Friday evening and Sund ay, come at other times and identify yourself as a\n\n23shareholder.  On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m.   Borsheim’s operates on a gross margin that is fully\ntwenty percentage points below that of its major rivals , so the more you buy, the more you save (or at least\nthat’s what my wife and daughter tell me).\nIn the mall outside of Borsheim’s, we will have some of the world’s top bridge experts available to\nplay with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon.  We expect Bob Hamman, Sharon Osberg, Fred Gitelman\nand Sheri Winestock to host tables.  Patrick Wolff, twi ce U.S. chess champion, will also be in the mall, taking\non all comers  blindfolded!  Last year, Patrick played six games simultaneously   with his blindfold\nsecurely in place  and for the first time suffered a loss.  (He won the other five games, however.)  He’s\nbeen training overtime ever since and is planning to start a new streak this year.\nAdditionally, Bill Robertie, one of only two players who have twice won the backgammon world\nchampionship, will be on hand to test your skill at that game.  Finally, we will have a newcomer: Peter\nMorris, the winner of the World Scrabble Championship in 1991.  Peter will play on five boardssimultaneously (no blindfold for him, however) and w ill also allow his challengers to consult a Scrabble\ndictionary.\nWe are also going to test your vocal chords at the mall.  My friend, Al Oehrle of Philadelphia, will\nbe at the piano to play any song in any key.  Susie and I will lead the singing.  She is good.\nGorat’s  my favorite steakhouse  will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on\nSunday, May 4, and will be serving from 4 p.m. until 10  p.m.  Please remember that to come to Gorat’s on\nSunday, you must have a reservation.  To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 1 ( but not before ).  If\nSunday is sold out, try Gorat’s on one of the other even ings you will be in town.  Show your sophistication by\nordering a rare T-bone with a double order of hash browns.\nThere won’t be a ball game this year.  After my fastball was clocked at 5 mph last year, I decided to\nhang up my spikes.  So I’ll see yo u on Saturday night at NFM instead.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nNext year our meeting will be held at Omaha’s ne w convention center.  This switch in locations will\nallow us to hold the event on either Saturday or Mond ay, whichever the majority of you prefer.  Using the\nenclosed special ballot, please vote for your preference – but only if you are likely to attend in the future .\nWe will make the Saturday/Monday decision based upon a count of shareholders, not shares.  That\nis, a Class B shareholder owning one share will have a vote equal to that of a Class A shareholder owning\nmany shares.  If the vote is close, we w ill go with the preference of out-of-towners.\nAgain, please vote only if there is a reasonable chance that you will be attending some meetings in\nthe future.\nWarren E.

In th is table, Berkshire's results\nthrough 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rule s.  In all other respects, the results are calculated using\nthe numbers originally reported.\nThe S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax  whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax .  If a corporation such as Berkshire\nwere simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appr opriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500\nin years when that index showed a pos itive return, but would have exceeded the S&P in years when the index showed a\nnegative return.  Over the years, the tax costs woul d have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n\n3BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOur gain in net worth during 2003 was $13.6 billion, which increased the per-share book value of\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 21%.  Over the last 39 years (that is, since present management took\nover) per-share book value has grown from $19 to $50,498, a rate of 22.2% compounded annually.*\nIt’s per-share intrinsic value that counts, however, not book value.  Here, the news is good:\nBetween 1964 and 2003, Berkshire morphed from a st ruggling northern textile bu siness whose intrinsic\nvalue was less than book into a widely diversified enterprise worth far more than book.  Our 39-year gainin intrinsic value has therefore some what exceeded our 22.2% gain in boo k.  (For a better understanding of\nintrinsic value and the economic principles that guide Charlie Munger, my partner and Berkshire’s vice-\nchairman, and me in running Berkshire, please read our Owner’s Manual, beginning on page 69.)\nDespite their shortcomings, book value calculati ons are useful at Berkshire as a slightly\nunderstated gauge for measuring the long-term  rate of increase in our intrinsic value.  The calculation is\nless relevant, however, than it once was in rating any single year’s performance versus the S&P 500 index\n(a comparison we display on the facing page).  Our equity holdings, including convertible preferreds, have\nfallen considerably as a percentage of our net worth, from an average of 114% in the 1980s, for example, toan average of 50% in 2000-03.  Th erefore, yearly movements in th e stock market now affect a much\nsmaller portion of our net worth than was once the case.\nNonetheless, Berkshire’s long-term performance versus the S&P remains all-important.  Our\nshareholders can buy the S&P through an index fund at very low cost.  Unless we achieve gains in per-\nshare intrinsic value in the future that outdo the S&P’ s performance, Charlie and I will be adding nothing to\nwhat you can accomplish on your own.\nIf we fail, we will have no excuses.  Charlie and I operate in an ideal environment.  To begin with,\nwe are supported by an incredible group of men and women who run our operating units.  If there were a\nCorporate Cooperstown, its roster would surely includ e many of our CEOs.  Any shortfall in Berkshire’s\nresults will not be caused by our managers.\nAdditionally, we enjoy a rare sort of managerial freedom.  Most companies are saddled with\ninstitutional constraints.  A company’s history, for example, may commit it to an industry that now offers\nlimited opportunity.  A more common problem is a sh areholder constituency that pressures its manager to\ndance to Wall Street’s tune.  Many CEOs resist, but others give in and adopt operating and capital-allocation policies far different from those they would choose if left to themselves.  \nAt Berkshire, neither history nor the demands of owners impede intelligent decision-making.\nWhen Charlie and I make mistakes, they ar e – in tennis parlance – unforced errors.\n                                                                 \n*All figures used in this report apply to Berksh ire’s A shares, the successor to the only stock that\nthe company had outstanding before 1996.  The B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30th that of\nthe A.\n\n4Operating Earnings\nWhen valuations are similar, we strongly prefer owning businesses to owning stocks.  During\nmost of our years of operation, however, stocks were  much the cheaper choice.  We therefore sharply tilted\nour asset allocation in those years toward equitie s, as illustrated by the percentages cited earlier.\nIn recent years, however, we’ve found it hard to find significantly undervalued stocks, a difficulty\ngreatly accentuated by the mushrooming of the funds we  must deploy.  Today, the number of stocks that\ncan be purchased in large enough quantities to move the performance needle at Berkshire is a small fractionof the number that existed a decade  ago.  (Investment managers often profit far more from piling up assets\nthan from handling those assets well.  So when one tells you that increased funds won’t hurt his investment\nperformance, step back: His nose is about to grow.)\nThe shortage of attractively-priced stocks in which we can put large sums doesn’t bother us,\nproviding  we can find companies to purchase that (1) have favorable and enduring economic charac-\nteristics; (2) are run by talented and honest managers and (3) are available at a sensible price. We have\npurchased a number of such businesses in recent years,  though not enough to fu lly employ the gusher of\ncash that has come our way.  In buying businesses, I’ve made some terrible mistakes, both of commission\nand omission. Overall, however, our acquisitions have led to decent gains in per-share earnings.\nBelow is a table that quantifies that point.  But first we need to warn you that growth-rate\npresentations can be significantly distorted by a calculate d selection of either initial or terminal dates.  For\nexample, if earnings are tiny in a beginning year, a long-term performance that was only mediocre can be\nmade to appear sensational.  That kind of distor tion can come about because the company at issue was\nminuscule in the base year – which means that only a handful of insiders actually benefited from the touted\nperformance – or because a larger company was then ope rating at just above breake ven.  Picking a terminal\nyear that is particularly buoyant will al so favorably bias a calculation of growth.\nThe Berkshire Hathaway that present manageme nt assumed control of in 1965 had long been\nsizable.  But in 1964, it earned only $175,586 or 15 cents per share, so close to breakeven that any\ncalculation of earnings growth from that base would be meaningless.  At the time, however, even those\nmeager earnings looked good:  Over  the decade following the 1955 me rger of Berkshire Fine Spinning\nAssociates and Hathaway Manufacturing, the comb ined operation had lost $10.1 million and many\nthousands of employees had been let go.  It was not a marriage made in heaven.\nAgainst this background, we give you a picture of Berkshire’s earnings growth that begins in\n1968, but also includes subsequent base years spaced five  years apart.  A series of  calculations is presented\nso that you can decide for yourself which period is most meaningful.  I’ve started with 1968 because it was\nthe first full year we operated National Indemnity, the initial acquisition we made as we began to expand\nBerkshire’s business.\nI don’t believe that using 2003 as the terminal year  distorts our calculations.  It was a terrific year\nfor our insurance business, but the big boost that gave to earnings was largely offset by the pathetically low\ninterest rates we earned on our large holdings of cash equivalents (a condition that will not last).  All\nfigures shown below, it should be noted, exclude capital gains.\nOperatin g Earnin gs Operatin g Earnin gs Subse quent Com pounded\nYear in $ millions Per Share in $ Growth Rate o f Per-Share Earnin gs\n1964 .2 .15 Not meanin gful  (1964-2003 )\n1968 2.7 2.69 22.8%  (1968-2003 )\n1973 11.9 12.18 20.8%  (1973-2003 )\n1978 30.0 29.15 21.1%  (1978-2003 )\n1983 48.6 45.60 24.3%  (1983-2003 )\n1988 313.4 273.37 18.6%  (1988-2003 )\n1993 477.8 413.19 23.9%  (1993-2003 )\n1998 1,277.0 1,020.49 28.2%  (1998-2003 )\n2003 5,422.0 3,531.32\n\n5We will continue the capital allocation practices we have used in the past.  If stocks become\nsignificantly cheaper than entire businesses, we will buy them aggressively.  If selected bonds become\nattractive, as they did in 2002, we will ag ain load up on these securities.  Under any market or economic\nconditions, we will be happy to buy businesses that meet our standards.  And, for those that do, the bigger\nthe better.  Our capital is underutilized now, but that will happen periodically.  It’s a painful condition to be\nin – but not as painful as doing something stupid.  (I speak from experience.)\nOverall, we are certain Berkshire’s performance in the future will fall far short of what it has been\nin the past.  Nonetheless, Charlie and I remain hopeful that we can deliver results that are modestly aboveaverage.  That’s what we’re being paid for.\nAcquisitions\nAs regular readers know, our acquisitions have often come about in strange ways.  None, however,\nhad a more unusual genesis than our purchase last year of Clayton Homes.\nThe unlikely source was a group of finance students from the University of Tennessee, and their\nteacher, Dr. Al Auxier.   For the past  five years, Al has br ought his class to Omaha, where the group tours\nNebraska Furniture Mart and Borshe im’s, eats at Gorat’s and then comes to Kiewit Plaza for a session with\nme.  Usually about 40 students participate.\nAfter two hours of give-and-take, the group traditio nally presents me with a thank-you gift.  (The\ndoors stay locked until they do.)  In past years it’s been items such as a football signed by Phil Fulmer anda basketball from Tennessee’s famous women’s team.\nThis past February, the group opted for a book – which, luckily for me, was the recently-published\nautobiography of Jim Clayton, founder of Clayton Home s.  I already knew the co mpany to be the class act\nof the manufactured housing industry, knowledge I acquired after earlier making the mistake of buying\nsome distressed junk debt of Oakwood Homes, one of the industry’s largest companies.  At the time of thatpurchase, I did not understand how atrocious consume r-financing practices had become throughout most of\nthe manufactured housing industry.  But I learned: Oakwood rather promptly went bankrupt.\nManufactured housing, it should be emphasized, can deliver very good value to home purchasers.\nIndeed, for decades, the industry has accounted for mo re than 15% of the homes built in the U.S.  During\nthose years, moreover, both the quality and variety of manufactured houses consistently improved.\nProgress in design and construction was not matched, however, by progress in distribution and\nfinancing. Instead, as the years went by, the industry’s business model increasingly centered on the ability\nof both the retailer and manufacturer to unload terrib le loans on naive lenders.  When “securitization” then\nbecame popular in the 1990s, furthe r distancing the supplier of funds from the lend ing transaction, the\nindustry’s conduct went from bad to worse.  Much of its volume a few years back came from buyers who\nshouldn’t have bought, financed by lenders who shouldn’t have lent.  The consequence has been huge\nnumbers of repossessions and pitifully lo w recoveries on the units repossessed.\nOakwood participated fully in the insanity.  Bu t Clayton, though it could not isolate itself from\nindustry practices, behaved considerably better than its major competitors.\nUpon receiving Jim Clayton’s book, I told the st udents how much I admire d his record and they\ntook that message back to Knoxville, home of both the University of Tennessee and Clayton Homes.  Althen suggested that I call Kevin Clayton, Jim’s son and the CEO, to express my views directly.  As I talked\nwith Kevin, it became clear that he was both able and a straight-shooter.\nSoon thereafter, I made an offer for the business based solely on Jim’s book, my evaluation of\nKevin, the public financials of Clayton and what I had learned from the Oakwood experience.  Clayton’sboard was receptive, since it understo od that the large-scale financing Clayton would need in the future\nmight be hard to get.  Lenders had fled the industry and securitizations, when possible at all, carried far\n\n6more expensive and restrictive terms than was previously  the case.  This tightening was particularly serious\nfor Clayton, whose earnings significantly depended on  securitizations.\nToday, the manufactured housing industry remain s awash in problems.  Delinquencies continue\nhigh, repossessed units still abound and the number of retailers has been halved.  A different business\nmodel is required, one that eliminates the ability of the retailer and salesman to pocket substantial moneyup front by making sales financed by loans that are destined to default.  Such transactions cause hardship to\nboth buyer and lender and lead to a flood of repossessions that then undercut the sale of new units.  Under a\nproper model – one requiring significant down payments and shorter-term loans – the industry will likelyremain much smaller than it was in the 90s.  But it w ill deliver to home buyers an asset in which they will\nhave equity, rather than disappointment, upon resale.\nIn the “full circle” department, Clayton has agr eed to buy the assets of Oakwood.  When the\ntransaction closes, Clayton’s manufacturing capac ity, geographical reach and sales outlets will be\nsubstantially increased.  As a byproduct, the debt of Oakwood that we own, which we bought at a deep\ndiscount, will probably return a small profit to us.  \nAnd the students?  In October, we had a surprise “graduation” ceremony in Knoxville for the 40\nwho sparked my interest in Clayton.  I donned a mortarboard and presented each  student with both a PhD\n(for phenomenal, hard-working dealmaker) from Berkshire and a B share.  Al got an A share.  If you meetsome of the new Tennessee shareholders at our annual meeting, give them your thanks.  And ask them if\nthey’ve read any good books lately.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIn early spring, Byron Trott, a Managing Director of Goldman Sachs, told me that Wal-Mart\nwished to sell its McLane subsidiary.  McLane distributes groceries and nonfood items to convenience\nstores, drug stores, wholesale clubs, mass merchandisers , quick service restaurants,  theaters and others.  It’s\na good business, but one not in the mainstream of Wal-Mart’s future.  It’s made to order, however, for us.\nMcLane has sales of about $23 billion, but operat es on paper-thin margins – about 1% pre-tax –\nand will swell Berkshire’s sales figures far more than our income.  In the past, some retailers had shunned\nMcLane because it was owned by their major competitor.  Grady Rosier, McLane’s superb CEO, has\nalready landed some of these accounts – he was in full stride the day the deal closed – and more will come.\nFor several years, I have given my vote to Wal-Mart in the balloting for Fortune Magazine’s\n“Most Admired” list.  Our McLane transaction reinforced my opinion.  To make the McLane deal, I had asingle meeting of about two hours with Tom Schoewe, Wal-Mart’s CFO, and we then shook hands.  (He\ndid, however, first call Bentonville).  Twenty-nine da ys later Wal-Mart had its money.  We did no “due\ndiligence.”  We knew everything would be exactly as Wal-Mart said it would be – and it was.\nI should add that Byron has now been instru mental in three Berkshire acquisitions.  He\nunderstands Berkshire far better than any investment banker with whom we have talked and – it hurts me tosay this – earns his fee.  I’m looking forward to deal number four (as, I am sure, is he).\nTaxes\nOn May 20, 2003, The Wash ington Post ran an op-ed piece by me  that was critical of the Bush tax\nproposals.  Thirteen days later, Pamela Olson, A ssistant Secretary for Tax Po licy at the U.S. Treasury,\ndelivered a speech about the new tax legislation saying , “That means a certain midwestern oracle, who, it\nmust be noted, has played the tax code like a fiddle, is still safe retaining all his earnings.”  I think she was\ntalking about me.\nAlas, my “fiddle playing” will not get me to Carnegie Hall – or even to a high school recital.\nBerkshire, on your behalf and mine, will send the Tr easury $3.3 billion for tax on its 2003 income, a sum\nequaling 2½% of the total income tax paid by all U.S. corporations in fiscal 2003.  (In contrast, Berkshire’s\nmarket valuation is about 1% of the value of all American corporations.)  Our payment will almost\n\n7certainly place us among our country’s top ten taxpaye rs.  Indeed, if only 5 40 taxpayers paid the amount\nBerkshire will pay, no other individual  or corporation would have to pay anything  to Uncle Sam.  That’s\nright: 290 million Americans and all other businesses would not have to pay a dime in income, socialsecurity, excise or estate taxes to the federal govern ment.  (Here’s the math: Federal tax receipts, including\nsocial security receipts, in fis cal 2003 totaled $1.782 trillion and 540 “Berkshires,” each paying $3.3\nbillion, would deliver the same $1.782 trillion.)\nOur federal tax return for 2002 (2003 is not fina lized), when we paid $1.75 billion, covered a mere\n8,905 pages.  As is required, we dutifully filed two copies of this return, creating a pile of paper seven feettall.  At World Headquarters, our small band of 15.8, though exhausted, momentarily flushed with pride:\nBerkshire, we felt, was surely pulling its  share of our country’s fiscal load.\nBut Ms. Olson sees things otherwise.  And if that  means Charlie and I need to try harder, we are\nready to do so.\nI do wish, however, that Ms. Olson would give me some  credit for the progress I’ve already made.\nIn 1944, I filed my first 1040, reporting my income as a thirteen-year-old newspaper carrier.  The return\ncovered three pages.  After I claimed the appropriate business deductions, such as $35 for a bicycle, my tax\nbill was $7.  I sent my check to the Treasury and it – without comment – promptly cashed it.  We lived in\npeace.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nI can understand why the Treasury is now frus trated with Corporate America and prone to\noutbursts.  But it should look to Congress and the Administration for redress, not to Berkshire.\nCorporate income taxes in fiscal 2003 accounted for 7.4% of all federal tax receipts, down from a\npost-war peak of 32% in 1952.  With one exception (1 983), last year’s percenta ge is the lowest recorded\nsince data was first published in 1934.\nEven so, tax breaks for corporations (and their investors, particularly large ones) were a major part\nof the Administration’s 2002 and 2003 initiatives.  If cl ass warfare is being waged in America, my class is\nclearly winning.  Today, many large corporations – run by CEOs whose fiddle-playing talents make your\nChairman look like he is all thumbs – pay nothing close to the stated federal tax rate of 35%.\nIn 1985, Berkshire paid $132 million in federal income taxes, and all corporations paid $61\nbillion.  The comparable amounts in  1995 were $286 million and $1 57 billion respectiv ely.  And, as\nmentioned, we will pay about $3.3 billion for 2003, a y ear when all corporations paid $132 billion.  We\nhope our taxes continue to rise in the future – it will mean we are prospering – but we also hope that the\nrest of Corporate America antes up along with us.  This might be a project for Ms. Olson to work on.\nCorporate Governance\nIn judging whether Corporate Amer ica is serious about reforming itself, CEO pay remains the acid\ntest.  To date, the results aren’t encouraging.  A fe w CEOs, such as Jeff Immelt  of General Electric, have\nled the way in initiating programs that are fair to mana gers and shareholders alike.  Generally, however, his\nexample has been more admired than followed.\nIt’s understandable how pay got out of hand.  When management hires employees, or when\ncompanies bargain with a vendor, the intensity of intere st is equal on both sides of the table.  One party’s\ngain is the other party’s loss, and the money involved has real meaning to both.  The result is an honest-to-\nGod negotiation.\nBut when CEOs (or their representatives) have met with compensation committees, too often one\nside – the CEO’s – has cared far more than the other about what bargain is struck.  A CEO, for example,\nwill always regard the difference between receiving  options for 100,000 sh ares or for 500,000 as\nmonumental.  To a comp committee, however, the difference may seem unimportant – particularly if, as\n\n8has been the case at most companies, neither grant w ill have any effect on reported earnings.  Under these\nconditions, the negotiation often has a “play-money” quality.\nOverreaching by CEOs greatly accel erated in the 1990s as compen sation packages gained by the\nmost avaricious– a title for which there was vigorous competition – were promptly replicated elsewhere.\nThe couriers for this epidemic of greed were usually consultants and human relations departments, whichhad no trouble perceiving who buttered their bread.  As one compensation consultant commented: “There\nare two classes of clients you don’t want to offend – actual and potential.”\nIn proposals for reforming this malfunctioning system, the cry has been for “independent”\ndirectors.  But the question of what truly motiv ates independence has largely been neglected.\nIn last year’s report, I took a look at how “independent” directors – as defined by statute – had\nperformed in the mutual fund field.  The Investment Company Act of 1940 mandated such directors, andthat means we’ve had an extended test of what statut ory standards produce.  In our examination last year,\nwe looked at the record of fund directors in respect to the two key tasks board members should perform –\nwhether at a mutual fund business or any other.  These two all-important functions are, first, to obtain (orretain) an able and honest manager and then to compensate that manager fairly.\nOur survey was not encouraging.  Year after year , at literally thousands of funds, directors had\nroutinely rehired the incumbent management company, however pathetic its performance had been.  Just as\nroutinely, the directors had mindlessl y approved fees that in many cases far exceeded those that could have\nbeen negotiated.  Then, when a management company was sold – invariably at a huge price relative totangible assets – the directors experienced a “counter-revelation” and immediately signed on with the new\nmanager and accepted its fee schedule.  In effect, th e directors decided that whoever would pay the most\nfor the old management company was the party that should manage the shareholders’ money in the future.\nDespite the lapdog behavior of independent fund directors, we did not conclude that they are bad\npeople.  They’re not.  But sadly, “boardroom atmos phere” almost invariably se dates their fiduciary genes.\nOn May 22, 2003, not long after Berkshire’s report appeared, the Chairman of the Investment\nCompany Institute addressed its membership about “The State of our Industry.”  Responding to those who\nhave “weighed in about our perceived failings,” he mused, “It makes me wonder what life would be like if\nwe’d actually done something wrong.”\nBe careful what you wish for. \nWithin a few months, the world began to lear n that many fund-management companies had\nfollowed policies that hurt the owners of the funds they managed, while simultaneously boosting the fees of\nthe managers.  Prior to their transgressions, it should  be noted, these management companies were earning\nprofit margins and returns on tangible equity that were the envy of Corporate America.  Yet to swell profits\nfurther, they trampled on the interests of fund shareholders in an appalling manner.\nSo what are the directors of these looted funds doing?  As I write this, I have seen none that have\nterminated the contract of the offending management company (though naturally that entity has often fired\nsome of its employees).  Can you imagine directors who had been personally defrauded taking such a boys-will-be-boys attitude?\nTo top it all off, at least one miscreant ma nagement company has put itself up for sale,\nundoubtedly hoping to receive a huge  sum for “delivering” the mutual funds it has managed to the highest\nbidder among other managers.  This is a travesty.  Why in the world don’t the directors of those funds\nsimply select whomever they think is best among the bidding organizations and sign up with that party\ndirectly?  The winner would consequently be spared a huge “payoff” to the former manager who, having\nflouted the principles of stewardship, deserves not a dime.  Not having to bear that acquisition cost, the\nwinner could surely manage the funds in question for a far lower ongoing fee than would otherwise have\nbeen the case.  Any truly independent director should insist on this approach to obtaining a new manager.\n\n9The reality is that neither the decades-old rules regulating invest ment company directors nor the\nnew rules bearing down on Corporate America foster the elec tion of truly independent directors.  In both\ninstances, an individual who is recei ving 100% of his income from dir ector fees – and who may wish to\nenhance his income through election to other boards – is  deemed independent.  Th at is nonsense.  The same\nrules say that Berkshire director an d lawyer Ron Olson, who receives from us perhaps 3% of his very large\nincome, does not qualify as independent because that 3% comes from legal fees Berkshire pays his firm\nrather than from fees he earns as a Berkshire director.  Rest assured, 3% from any source would not torpedo\nRon’s independence.  But getting 20%, 30% or 50% of  their income from director fees might well temper\nthe independence of many individuals, particularly if their overall income is not large.  Indeed, I think it’s\nclear that at mutual funds, it has.\n* * * * * * * * * * *\nLet me make a small suggestion to “independent” mutual fund directors.  Why not simply affirm\nin each annual report that “(1) We have looked at  other management companies and believe the one we\nhave retained for the upcoming year is among the better operations in the field; and (2) we have negotiated\na fee with our managers comparable to what other clients with equivalent funds would negotiate.”\nIt does not seem unreasonable for shareholders to  expect fund directors – who are often receiving\nfees that exceed $100,000 annually – to declare themselves on these points.  Certainly these directors\nwould satisfy themselves on both matters were they handing over a large chunk of their own money to the\nmanager.  If directors are unwilling to make these tw o declarations, shareholders should heed the maxim\n“If you don’t know whose side someone is on, he’s probably not on yours.”\nFinally, a disclaimer.  A great many funds have been run well and conscientiously despite the\nopportunities for malfeasance that exist.  The share holders of these funds have benefited, and their\nmanagers have earned their pay.  Indeed, if I were a director of certain funds, including some that charge\nabove-average fees, I would enthusiastically make th e two declarations I have suggested.  Additionally,\nthose index funds that are very low-cost (such as Vanguard’s) are investor-frie ndly by definition and are\nthe best selection for most of those who wish to own equities.\nI am on my soapbox now only because the blatant wrongdoing that has occurred has betrayed the\ntrust of so many millions of shareholders.  Hundreds of industry insiders had to know what was going on,\nyet none publicly said a word.  It took Eliot Spit zer, and the whistleblowers who aided him, to initiate a\nhousecleaning.  We urge fund directors to continue the job.  Like directors throughout Corp orate America,\nthese fiduciaries must now decide whether their job is to work for owners or for managers.\nBerkshire Governance\nTrue independence – meaning the willingness to challenge a forceful CEO when something is\nwrong or foolish – is an enormously valuable trait in a director.  It is also rare.  The place to look for it is\namong high-grade people whose interests are in line with those of rank-and-file shareholders – and are in\nline in a very big way .\nWe’ve made that search at Berkshire.   We now have eleven directors and each  of them, combined\nwith members of their families, owns more than $4 million of Berkshire stock.  Moreover, all have held\nmajor stakes in Berkshire for many years.  In the case of six of the eleven, family ownership amounts to at\nleast hundreds of millions and dates back at least three decades.  All eleven  directors purchased their\nholdings in the market just as you did; we’ve never passed out options or restricted shares.  Charlie and Ilove such honest-to-God ownership.  After all, who ever washes a rental car?\nIn addition, director fees at Berkshire are nominal (as my son, Howard, periodically reminds me).\nThus, the upside from Berkshire for all eleven is propo rtionately the same as the upside for any Berkshire\nshareholder.  And it always will be.\n\n10The downside for Berkshire di rectors is actually worse than yours because we carry no directors\nand officers liability insurance.  Therefore, if so mething really catastrophic happens on our directors’\nwatch, they are exposed to lo sses that will far exceed yours. \nThe bottom line for our directors: You win, they win big; you lose, they lose big.  Our approach\nmight be called owner-capitalism.  We know of no better way to engender true independence.  (Thisstructure does not guarantee perfect behavior, however: I’ve sat on boards of companies in which Berkshire\nhad huge stakes and remained silent as questionable proposals were rubber-stamped.)\nIn addition to being independent, directors should have business savvy, a shareholder orientation\nand a genuine interest in the company.  The rarest of these qualities is business savvy – and if it is lacking,\nthe other two are of little help.  Many people wh o are smart, articulate and admired have no real\nunderstanding of business.  That’s no sin; they may shine elsewhere.  But they don’t belong on corporate\nboards.  Similarly, I would be useless on a medical or scientific board (though I would likely be welcomedby a chairman who wanted to run things his way).  My name would dress up the list of directors, but I\nwouldn’t know enough to critically evaluate proposals.  Moreover, to cloak my ignorance, I would keep my\nmouth shut (if you can imagine that).  In effect, I could be replaced, without loss, by a potted plant.\nLast year, as we moved to change our board, I asked for self-nominations from shareholders who\nbelieved they had the requisite qualities to be a Berksh ire director.  Despite the lack of either liability\ninsurance or meaningful compensatio n, we received more than twenty applications.  Most were good,\ncoming from owner-oriented individuals having family holdings of Berkshire worth well over $1 million.\nAfter considering them, Charlie and I – with the concurrence of our incumbent directors – asked fourshareholders who did not nominate themselves to join the board: David Gottesman, Charlotte Guyman,\nDon Keough and Tom Murphy.  These four people are all friends of mine, and I know their strengths well.\nThey bring an extraordinary amount of business talent to Berkshire’s board.\nThe primary job of our directors is to select my successor, either upon my death or disability, or\nwhen I begin to lose my marbles.  (David Ogilvy had it right when he said: “Develop your eccentricities\nwhen young.  That way, when you get older, people won’t think you are going gaga.”  Charlie’s family and\nmine feel that we overr eacted to David’s advice.) \nAt our directors’ meetings we cover the usual run of housekeeping matters.  But the real\ndiscussion – both with me in the room and absent – centers on the strengths and weaknesses of the fourinternal candidates to replace me.  \nOur board knows that th e ultimate scorecard on its performance will be determined by the record\nof my successor.  He or she will need to maintain Berkshire’s culture, allocate capital and keep a group of\nAmerica’s best managers happy in their jobs.  This isn’ t the toughest task in the world – the train is already\nmoving at a good clip down the track – and I’m totall y comfortable about it being done well by any of the\nfour candidates we have identified.  I have more than  99% of my net worth in Berkshire and will be happy\nto have my wife or foundation (depending on the order in which she and I die) continue this concentration.\nSector Results\nAs managers, Charlie and I want to give our owners the financial information and commentary we\nwould wish to receive if our roles were reversed.  To do this with both clarity and reasonable brevity\nbecomes more difficult as Berkshire’s scope widens.  Some of our businesses have vastly different\neconomic characteristics from others, which means that our co nsolidated statements, with their jumble of\nfigures, make useful analysis almost impossible.\nOn the following pages, therefor e, we will present some balance sheet and earnings figures from\nour four major categories of businesses along with co mmentary about each.  We particularly want you to\nunderstand the limited circumstances under which we will use debt, since typically we shun it.  We will\nnot, however, inundate you with data that has no r eal value in calculating Berkshire’s intrinsic value.\nDoing so would likely obfuscate the most important f acts.  One warning: When  analyzing Berkshire, be\n\n11sure to remember that the company should be viewed  as an unfolding movie, not as a still photograph.\nThose who focused in the past on only the snapshot  of the day sometimes reached erroneous conclusions.\nInsurance\nLet’s start with insurance – si nce that’s where the money is.\nThe fountain of funds we enjoy in our insurance operations comes from “float,” which is money\nthat doesn’t belong to us but that we temporarily hold .  Most of our float arises because (1) premiums are\npaid upfront though the service we provide – insurance protection – is delivered over a period that usually\ncovers a year and; (2) loss events that occur today do not always result in our immediately paying claims,\nsince it sometimes takes years for losses to be re ported (think asbestos), negotiated and settled.\nFloat is wonderful – if it doesn’t come at a high price.  The cost of float is determined by\nunderwriting results, meaning how lo sses and expenses paid compare with premiums received.  The\nproperty-casualty industry as a whole regularly operates at a substantial underwriting loss, and therefore\noften has a cost of float that is unattractive.\nOverall, our results have been good.  True, we’ve had five terrible years in which float cost us\nmore than 10%.  But in 18 of the 37 years Berkshire has been in the insurance business, we have operated\nat an underwriting profit, meaning we were actually paid for holding money.  And the quantity of this\ncheap money has grown far beyond what I dreamed it could when we entered the business in 1967.\nYearend Float (in $ millions)\nOther Other\nYear GEICO General Re Reinsurance Primary Total\n1967 20 20\n1977 40 131 171\n1987 701 807 1,508\n1997 2,917 4,014 455 7,386\n1998 3,125 14,909 4,305 415 22,754\n1999 3,444 15,166 6,285 403 25,298\n2000 3,943 15,525 7,805 598 27,871\n2001 4,251 19,310 11,262 685 35,508\n2002 4,678 22,207 13,396 943 41,224\n2003 5,287 23,654 13,948 1,331 44,220\nLast year was a standout.  Float reached record levels and it came without cost as all major\nsegments contributed to Berkshire’s $1.7 billion pre-tax underwriting profit.\nOur results have been exceptional for one reason: We have truly exceptional managers.  Insurers\nsell a non-proprietary piece of paper containing a non-proprietary promise.  Anyone can copy anyone else’s\nproduct.  No installed base, key patents, critical real  estate or natural resource position protects an insurer’s\ncompetitive position.  Typically, brands do not mean much either.\nThe critical variables, therefore, are managerial  brains, discipline and integrity.  Our managers\nhave all of these attributes – in spades.  Let’s take a look at these all-stars and their operations.\n• General Re had been Berkshire’s problem child in the years following our acquisition of it in\n1998.  Unfortunately, it was a 400-pound child, and its negative impact on our overall\nperformance was large.\nThat’s behind us: Gen Re is fixed.  Thank Joe Brandon, its CEO, and his partner, TadMontross, for that.  When I wrote you last year, I thought that discipline had been restored toboth underwriting and reserving, and events during 2003 solidified my view.\n\n12That does not mean we will never have setbacks.  Reinsurance is a business that is certain to\ndeliver blows from time to time.  But, under Joe and Tad, this operation will be a powerful\nengine driving Berkshire’s future profitability.\nGen Re’s financial strength, unmatched among reinsurers even as we started 2003, furtherimproved during the year.  Many of the comp any’s competitors suff ered credit downgrades\nlast year, leaving Gen Re, and its sister operation at National Indemnity, as the only AAA-\nrated companies among the world’s major reinsurers.\nWhen insurers purchase reinsurance, they buy only a promise – one whose validity may notbe tested for decades – and there are no prom ises in the reinsurance world equaling those\noffered by Gen Re and National Indemnity.  Fu rthermore, unlike most reinsurers, we retain\nvirtually all of the risks we assume.  Therefore, our ability to pay is not dependent on the\nability or willingness of others to reimburse us.  This independent  financial strength could be\nenormously important when the industry expe riences the mega-catastrophe it surely will.\n• Regular readers of our annual reports know of Ajit Jain’s incredible contributions to\nBerkshire’s prosperity over the past 18 years.  He continued to pour it on in 2003.  With a\nstaff of only 23, Ajit runs one of the world’ s largest reinsurance operations, specializing in\nmammoth and unusual risks.\nOften, these involve assuming catastrophe risk s – say, the threat of a large California\nearthquake – of a size far greater than any ot her reinsurer will accept.  This means Ajit’s\nresults (and Berkshire’s) will be lumpy.  You should, therefore, expect his operation to have\nan occasional horrible year.  Over time, however,  you can be confident of a terrific result from\nthis one-of-a-kind manager.\nAjit writes some very unusual policies.  Last year, for example, PepsiCo promoted a drawingthat offered participants a chance to win a $1  billion prize.  Understandably, Pepsi wished to\nlay off this risk, and we were the logical party to assume it.  So we wrote a $1 billion policy,\nretaining the risk entirely for our own account.  Because the prize, if won, was payable over\ntime, our exposure in present-value terms was $250 million.  (I helpfully suggested that any\nwinner be paid $1 a year for a billion years, but that proposal didn’t fly.)  The drawing was\nheld on September 14.  Ajit and I held our breath, as did the finalist in the contest, and we lefthappier than he.  PepsiCo has renewed for a repeat contest in 2004.\n• GEICO was a fine insurance company when Tony Nicely took over as CEO in 1992.  Now it\nis a great one.  During his tenure, premium volume has increased from $2.2 billion to $8.1\nbillion, and our share of the personal-auto market has grown from 2.1% to 5.0%.  More\nimportant, GEICO has paired these gains with outstanding underwriting performance.\n(We now pause for a commercial)\nIt’s been 67 years since Leo Goodwin created a great business idea at GEICO, one designed\nto save policyholders significant money.  Go to Geico.com or call 1-800-847-7536 to see\nwhat we can do for you.\n(End of commercial)\nIn 2003, both the number of inquiries coming into GEICO and its closure rate on these\nincreased significantly.  As a result our preferred policyholder count grew 8.2%, and ourstandard and non-standard policies grew 21.4%.\nGEICO’s business growth creates a never-end ing need for more employees and facilities.\nOur most recent expansio n, announced in December, is a cu stomer service center in – I’m\ndelighted to say – Buffalo.  Stan Lipsey, the publisher of our Buffalo News, was instrumental\nin bringing the city and GEICO together.\n\n13The key figure in this matter, however, was Governor George Pataki.  His leadership and\ntenacity are why Buffalo will have 2,500 new jobs when our expansion is fully rolled out.Stan, Tony, and I – along with Buffalo – thank him for his help.\n• Berkshire’s smaller insurers had another terrific  year.  This group, run by Rod Eldred, John\nKizer, Tom Nerney, Don Towle and Don Wurs ter, increased its float by 41%, while\ndelivering an excellent underwriting profit.  Thes e men, though operating in unexciting ways,\nproduce truly exciting results.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nWe should point out again that in any given year a company writing long-tail insurance (coverages\ngiving rise to claims that are often settled many y ears after the loss-causing event takes place) can report\nalmost any earnings that the CEO desi res.  Too often the industry has re ported wildly inaccurate figures by\nmisstating liabilities.  Most of the mistakes have be en innocent.  Sometimes, however, they have been\nintentional, their object being to fool investors and regulators.  Auditors and actuaries have usually failed toprevent both varieties of misstatement.\nI have failed on occasion too, particularly in not spotting Gen Re’s unw itting underreserving a few\nyears back.  Not only did that mean we reported inaccurate figures to you , but the error also resulted in our\npaying very substantial taxes earlier than was necessary.  Aaarrrggghh.  I told you last year, however, that I\nthought our current reserving was at appropriate levels.  So far, that judgment is holding up.\nHere are Berkshire’s pre-tax underwriting results by segment:\nGain (Loss) in $ millions\n2003 2002\nGen Re...................................................................................................... $   145 $(1,393)\nAjit’s business excluding retroactive contracts ........................................ 1,434 980\nAjit’s retroactiv e contracts* .....................................................................

In brief, this segment consists of a few jumbo policies that are likely to\nproduce underwriting losses (which are capped) but also provide un usually large amounts of float.\nRegulated Utility Businesses\nThrough MidAmerican Energy Holdings, we own an 80.5% (fully diluted) interest in a wide\nvariety of utility operations.  The largest are (1) York shire Electricity and Northern Electric, whose 3.7\nmillion electric customers make it the third largest di stributor of electricity in  the U.K.; (2) MidAmerican\nEnergy, which serves 689,000 elect ric customers in Iowa and; (3) Kern River and Northern Natural\npipelines, which carry 7.8% of the natural gas transported in the United States.\nBerkshire has three partners, who own the remaining 19.5%:  Dave Sokol and Greg Abel, the\nbrilliant managers of the business, and Walter Scott, a long-time friend of mine who introduced me to the\ncompany.  Because MidAmerican is subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act (“PUHCA”),Berkshire’s voting interest is limited to 9.9%.  Walter has the controlling vote.\nOur limited voting interest forces  us to account for MidAmerican in  our financial statements in an\nabbreviated manner.  Instead of our fully including its assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our\nstatements, we record only a one-lin e entry in both our balance sheet and income account.  It’s likely that\n\n14some day, perhaps soon, either PUHCA will be rep ealed or accounting rules will change.  Berkshire’s\nconsolidated figures would then take in all of MidAmerican, including the substantial debt it utilizes.\nThe size of this debt (which is not now, nor w ill it be, an obligation of Berkshire) is entirely\nappropriate.  MidAmerican’s diverse and stable utility operations assure that, even under harsh economic\nconditions, aggregate earnings will be ample to very comfortably service all debt.\nAt yearend, $1.578 billion of MidAmerican’s most junior debt was payable to Berkshire.  This\ndebt has allowed acquisitions to be financed without our three partners needing to increase their alreadysubstantial investments in MidAmerican.  By charging 11% interest, Berkshire is compensated fairly for\nputting up the funds needed for purchases, while our pa rtners are spared dilution of their equity interests.\nMidAmerican also owns a significant non-utility business, Home Services of America, the second\nlargest real estate broker in the country.  Unlike our utility operations, this business is highly cyclical, but\nnevertheless one we view enthusiastically.  We have an exceptional manager, Ron Peltier, who, through\nboth his acquisition and operational skills, is building a brokerage powerhouse.\nLast year, Home Services participated in $48.6 billion of transactions, a gain of $11.7 billion from\n2002.  About 23% of the increase came from four acquisitions made during the year.  Through our 16\nbrokerage firms – all of which retain their local identities – we employ 16,343 brokers in 16 states.  HomeServices is almost certain to grow  substantially in the next decade as  we continue to acquire leading\nlocalized operations.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nHere’s a tidbit for fans of free enterprise.  On March 31, 1990, the day electric utilities in the U.K.\nwere denationalized, Northern and Yorkshire had 6,800 employees in functions these companies continue\ntoday to perform.  Now they employ 2,539.  Yet the companies are serving about the same number of\ncustomers as when they were government ow ned and are distributing more electricity.\nThis is not, it should be noted, a triumph of de regulation.  Prices and earnings continue to be\nregulated in a fair manner by the government, just as they should be.  It is a victory, however, for those who\nbelieve that profit-motivated managers, even though th ey recognize that the benefits will largely flow to\ncustomers, will find efficiencies that government never will.\nHere are some key figures on MidAmerican’s operations:\nEarnings (in $ millions)\n2003 2002\nU.K. U tilities ...................................................................................................... $     289 $     267\nIowa.................................................................................................................... 269 241\nPipelines ............................................................................................................. 261 104\nHome Services.................................................................................................... 113 70\nOther (Net) .........................................................................................................        144        108\nEarnings before corpor ate interest  and tax ......................................................... 1,076 790\nCorporate Interest, othe r than to Berkshire.........................................................

Here’s some commentary on the most\nimportant.\n• I manage a few opportunistic strategies in AAA fixed-income securities that have been quite\nprofitable in the last few years.  These opport unities come and go – and at present, they are\ngoing.  We sped their departure somewhat last year, thereby realizing 24% of the capital gains\nwe show in the table that follows.\nThough far from foolproof, these transactions  involve no credit risk  and are conducted in\nexceptionally liquid securities.  We therefor e finance the positions almost entirely with\nborrowed money.  As the assets are reduced , so also are the borrowings.  The smaller\nportfolio we now have means that in the near future our earnings in this category will declinesignificantly.  It was fun while it lasted, and at some point we’ll get another turn at bat.\n• A far less pleasant unwinding ope ration is taking place at Gen Re Securities, the trading and\nderivatives operation we inherited wh en we purchased General Reinsurance.\nWhen we began to liquidate Gen Re Securities in early 2002, it had 23,218 outstanding tickets\nwith 884 counterparties (some having names I couldn’t pronounce, much less\ncreditworthiness I could evaluate).  Since then, the unit’s managers have been skillful and\ndiligent in unwinding positions.  Yet, at yearen d – nearly two years la ter – we still had 7,580\ntickets outstanding with 453 counterparties.  (As the country song laments, “How can I miss\nyou if you won’t go away?”)\nThe shrinking of this business has been costly.  We’ve had pre-tax losses of $173 million in\n2002 and $99 million in 2003.  These losses, it should be noted, came from a portfolio ofcontracts that – in full compliance with GAAP – had been regularly marked-to-market with\nstandard allowances for future credit-loss and administrative costs.  Moreover, our liquidation\nhas taken place both in a benign market – we’v e had no credit losses of significance – and in\nan orderly manner.  This is just the opposite of what might be expected if a financial crisis\nforced a number of derivatives dealer s to cease operations simultaneously.\nIf our derivatives experience – and the Freddi e Mac shenanigans of mind-blowing size and\naudacity that were revealed last year – ma kes you suspicious of accounting in this arena,\nconsider yourself wised up.  No matter how fi nancially sophisticated you are, you can’t\npossibly learn from reading the disclosure documents of a derivatives-intensive company\nwhat risks lurk in its positions.  Indeed, the more you know about derivatives, the less you\nwill feel you can learn from the disclosures no rmally proffered you.  In Darwin’s words,\n“Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge.”\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAnd now it’s confession time: I’m sure I could have saved you $100 million or so, pre-tax, if I\nhad acted more promptly to shut down Gen Re Securities.  Both Charlie and I knew at the\ntime of the General Reinsurance merger that its derivatives business was unattractive.\nReported profits struck us as illusory, and we felt that the business carried sizable risks thatcould not effectively be measured or limited.  Moreover, we knew that any major problems\nthe operation might experience would likely correlate with troubles in the financial or\ninsurance world that would affect Berkshire elsewhere.  In other words, if the derivativesbusiness were ever to need shoring up, it would commandeer the capital and credit of\nBerkshire at just the time we could otherwise deploy those resources to huge advantage.  (A\nhistorical note: We had just such an experience in 1974 when we were the victim of a majorinsurance fraud.  We could not determine for some time how much the fraud would ultimately\ncost us and therefore kept more funds in cash-equivalents than we normally would have. \n\n16Absent this precaution, we would have made larger purchases of stocks that were then\nextraordinarily cheap.)\nCharlie would have moved swiftly to close dow n Gen Re Securities – no question about that.\nI, however, dithered.  As a consequence, our shareholders are paying a far higher price than\nwas necessary to exit this business.\n• Though we include Gen Re’s sizable life and he alth reinsurance business in the “insurance”\nsector, we show the results for Ajit Jain’s life and annuity business in this section.  That’s\nbecause this business, in larg e part, involves arbitraging m oney.  Our annuities range from a\nretail product sold directly on the Internet to structured settlements that require us to makepayments for 70 years or more to people severely injured in accidents.\nWe’ve realized some extra inco me in this business because of accelerated principal payments\nwe received from certain fixed-income secur ities we had purchased at discounts.  This\nphenomenon has ended, and earnings are therefore likely to be lower in this segment during\nthe next few years.\n• We have a $604 million investment in Value Capital, a partnership run by Mark Byrne, a\nmember of a family that has helped Berkshire over the years in many ways.  Berkshire is a\nlimited partner in, and has no say in the management of, Mark’s enterprise, which specializes\nin highly-hedged fixed-income opportunities.  Mark is smart and honest and, along with his\nfamily, has a significant investment in Value.\nBecause of accounting abuses at Enron and elsewh ere, rules will soon be  instituted that are\nlikely to require that Value’s assets and liab ilities be consolidated on Berkshire’s balance\nsheet.  We regard this requirement as inappr opriate, given that Value’s liabilities – which\nusually are above $20 billion – are in no way ours .  Over time, other investors will join us as\npartners in Value.  When enough do, the need for us to consolidate Value will disappear.\n• We have told you in the past about Berkadia, the partnership we formed three years ago with\nLeucadia to finance and manage the wind-down of Finova, a bankrupt lending operation.  The\nplan was that we would supply most of the capital and Leucadia would supply most of the\nbrains.  And that’s the way it has worked.  Indeed, Joe Steinberg and Ian Cumming, whotogether run Leucadia, have done such a fine job in liquidating Finova’s portfolio that the $5.6\nbillion guarantee we took on in connection with the transaction has been extinguished.  The\nunfortunate byproduct of this fast payoff is that our future income will be much reduced.\nOverall, Berkadia has made excellent money for us, and Joe and Ian have been terrific\npartners.\n• Our leasing businesses are XTRA (transporta tion equipment) and CORT (office furniture).\nBoth operations have had poor earnings during the past two years as the recession caused\ndemand to drop considerably more than was antic ipated.  They remain leaders in their fields,\nand I expect at least a modest impr ovement in their ear nings this year.\n• Through our Clayton purchase, we acquired a significant manufactured-housing finance\noperation.  Clayton, like others in this business, had traditionally securitized the loans it\noriginated.  The practice relieved stress on Clay ton’s balance sheet, but a by-product was the\n“front-ending” of income (a result dictated by GAAP).\nWe are in no hurry to record income, have enormous balance-sheet strength, and believe thatover the long-term the economics of holding our consumer paper are superior to what we can\nnow realize through securitization.  So Clayton has begun to retain its loans.\nWe believe it’s appropriate to finance a soundly-selected book  of interest-bearing receivables\nalmost entirely with debt (just as a bank woul d).  Therefore, Berksh ire will borrow money to\nfinance Clayton’s portfolio and re-lend these funds to Clayton at our cost plus one percentage\n\n17point.  This markup fairly compensates Berksh ire for putting its exceptional creditworthiness\nto work, but it still delivers money to Clayton at an attractive price.\nIn 2003, Berkshire did $2 billion of such borrowing and re-lending, with Clayton using muchof this money to fund several large purchase s of portfolios from lenders exiting the business.\nA portion of our loans to Clay ton also provided “catch-up” funding for paper it had generated\nearlier in the year from its own operatio n and had found difficult to securitize.\nYou may wonder why we borrow money while sitti ng on a mountain of cash.  It’s because of\nour “every tub on its own bottom” philosophy.  We believe that any subsidiary lending money\nshould pay an appropriate rate for the funds needed to carry its  receivables and should not be\nsubsidized by its parent.  Otherwise, having a rich daddy can lead to sloppy decisions.\nMeanwhile, the cash we accumulate at Berkshire is  destined for business acquisitions or for\nthe purchase of securities that offer opportun ities for significant profit.  Clayton’s loan\nportfolio will likely grow to at least $5 billion in  not too many years and, with sensible credit\nstandards in place, should deliver significant earnings.\nFor simplicity’s sake, we include all of Clayton’s earnings in this sector, though a sizable\nportion is derived from areas other than consumer finance.\n(in $ millions)\nPre-Tax Earnings Interest-bearing Liabilities\n2003 2002 2003 2002\nTrading  – Ordinary Income ........................... $  379 $  553 $7,826 $13,762\nGen Re Se curities ...........................................

And earnings at Johns Manville, the fourth, were trending upward at\nyearend.  Collectively, th ese companies earned 21.0 % on tangible net worth.\n• Shaw Industries, the world’s largest manufacturer of broadloom carpet, also had a record year.  Led by\nBob Shaw, who built this huge enterprise from a standing start, the company will likely set another\nearnings record in 2004.  In November, Shaw acquired various carpet operations from Dixie Group,\nwhich should add about $240 million to sales this year, boosting Shaw’s volume to nearly $5 billion.\n• Within the apparel group, Fruit of the Loom is our  largest operation.  Fruit has three major assets: a\n148-year-old universally-recognized  brand, a low-cost manufacturing operation, and John Holland, its\nCEO.  In 2003, Fruit accounted for 42.3% of the men’s and boys’ underwear that was sold by mass\nmarketers (Wal-Mart, Target, K-Mart , etc.) and increased its share of  the women’s and girls’ business\nin that channel to 13.9%, up from 11.3% in 2002.\n• In retailing, our furniture group earned $106 million pre-tax, our jewelers $59 million and See’s, which\nis both a manufacturer and retailer, $59 million.\nBoth R.C. Willey and Nebraska Furniture Mart (“ NFM”) opened hugely successful stores last year,\nWilley in Las Vegas and NFM in Kansas City, Kansas.  Indeed, we believe the Kansas City store is the\ncountry’s largest-volume home-furnishings store.  (Our Omaha operation, while located on a single\nplot of land, consists of three units.)\n\n19NFM was founded by Rose Blumkin (“Mrs. B”) in 1937 with $500.  She worked until she was 103\n(hmmm . . . not a bad idea).  One piece of wisdom she imparted to the gene rations following her was,\n“If you have the lowest price, customers will find you at the bottom of a river.”  Our store serving\ngreater Kansas City, which is located in one of th e area’s more sparsely populated parts, has proved\nMrs. B’s point.  Though we have more than 25 acres of parking, the lot has at times overflowed.\n“Victory,” President Kennedy told us after the Bay of  Pigs disaster, “has a thousand fathers, but defeat\nis an orphan.”  At NFM, we knew we had a winner a month after the boffo opening in Kansas City,\nwhen our new store attracted an unex pected paternity claim.  A speake r there, referring to the Blumkin\nfamily, asserted, “They had enough confidence and the policies of the Administration were working\nsuch that they were able to provide work for 1,000 of our fellow citizens.”  The proud papa at the\npodium?  President George W. Bush. \n• In flight services, FlightSafety, our training operation, experienced a drop in “normal” operating\nearnings from $183 million to $150 million.  (The abnormals: In 2002 we had a $60 million pre-tax\ngain from the sale of a partnership interest to Boeing, and in 2003 we recognized a $37 million loss\nstemming from the premature obsolescence of simulato rs.)  The corporate aviation business has slowed\nsignificantly in the past few years, and this f act has hurt FlightSafety’s results.  The company\ncontinues, however, to be far and away the leader in its field.  Its simulators have an original cost of\n$1.2 billion, which is more than triple the cost of those operated by our closest competitor.\nNetJets, our fractional-ownership operation lost $41 million pre-tax in 2003.  The company had amodest operating profit in the U.S., but this was more than offset by a $32 million loss on aircraftinventory and by continued losses in Europe.\nNetJets continues to dominate the fractional-ownershi p field, and its lead is increasing: Prospects\noverwhelmingly turn to us rather than to our three major competitors.  Last year, among the four of us,\nwe accounted for 70% of net sales (measured by value).\nAn example of what sets NetJets apart from co mpetitors is our Mayo Clinic Executive Travel\nResponse program, a free benefit enjoyed by all of our owners.  On land or in the air, anywhere in theworld and at any hour of any day, our owners and their families have an immediate link to Mayo.\nShould an emergency occur while they are traveling here or abroad, Mayo will instantly direct them to\nan appropriate doctor or hospital.  Any baseline data about the patient that Mayo possesses issimultaneously made available to the treating physician.  Many owners have already found this service\ninvaluable, including one who needed emergency brain surgery in Eastern Europe.\nThe $32 million inventory write-down we took in 2003 occurred because of falling prices for usedaircraft early in the year.  Sp ecifically, we bought back fractions from withdrawing owners at\nprevailing prices, and these fell in value before we were able to remarket them.  Prices are now stable.\nThe European loss is painful.  But any company that forsakes Europe, as all of our competitors havedone, is destined for second-tier status.  Many of our U.S. owners fly extensively in Europe and wantthe safety and security assured by a NetJets plane and pilots.  Despite a slow start, furthermore, we are\nnow adding European customers at a good pace.  During the years 20 01 through 2003, we had gains of\n88%, 61% and 77% in European management-and-flying revenues.  We have not, however, yetsucceeded in stemming the flow of red ink.\nRich Santulli, NetJets’ extraordinar y CEO, and I expect our European loss to diminish in 2004 and also\nanticipate that it will be more than offset by U. S. profits.  Overwhelmingly, our owners love the\nNetJets experience.  Once a customer has tried us , going back to commercial aviation is like going\nback to holding hands.  NetJets will become a very big business over time and will be one in which we\nare preeminent in both customer satisfac tion and profits.  Rich will see to that.\n\n20Investments\nThe table that follows shows our common stock investments.  Those that had a market value of\nmore than $500 million at the end of 2003 are  itemized.\n12/31/03\nShares CompanyPercentage of\nCompany Owned Cost              Market\n(in $  millions)\n151,610,700 American Express Company ................ 11.8 $  1,470 $  7,312\n200,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company ..................... 8.2 1,299 10,150\n96,000,000 The Gillette Company .......................... 9.5 600 3,526\n14,610,900 H&R Block, Inc.................................... 8.2 227 809\n15,476,500 HCA Inc. .............................................. 3.1 492 665\n6,708,760 M&T Bank Corporation ....................... 5.6 103 659\n24,000,000 Moody’s Corporation ........................... 16.1 499 1,453\n2,338,961,000 PetroChina Company Limited .............. 1.3 488 1,340\n1,727,765 The Washington Post Company ........... 18.1 11 1,367\n56,448,380 Wells Fargo & Company...................... 3.3 463 3,324\nOthers ...................................................     2,863     4,682\nTotal Common Stocks .......................... $  8,515 $35,287\nWe bought some Wells Fargo shares last year.  Otherwise, among our six largest holdings, we last\nchanged our position in Coca-Cola in  1994, American Express in 1998,  Gillette in 1989, Washington Post\nin 1973, and Moody’s in 2000.  Brokers don’t love us.\nWe are neither enthusiastic nor negative about th e portfolio we hold.  We own pieces of excellent\nbusinesses – all of which had good gains in intrinsic value last year – but their current prices reflect their\nexcellence.  The unpleasant corollary to this conclusion is that I made a big mistake in not selling several of\nour larger holdings during The Great Bubble.  If these stocks are fully priced now, you may wonder what Iwas thinking four years ago when their intrinsic valu e was lower and their prices far higher.  So do I.\nIn 2002, junk bonds became very  cheap, and we purchased abou t $8 billion of these.  The\npendulum swung quickly though, and this sector now looks decidedly unattractive to us.  Yesterday’s\nweeds are today being priced as flowers.\nWe’ve repeatedly emphasized that realized gain s at Berkshire are meaningless for analytical\npurposes.  We have a huge amount of unrealized gains on our books, and our thinking about when, and if,\nto cash them depends not at all on a desire to report earnings at one specific time or another.  Nevertheless,to see the diversity of our investment activities, you may be interested in the following table, categorizing\nthe gains we reported during 2003:\nCategory Pre-Tax Gain\n(in $ million)\nCommon Stocks .............................................................................................................. $   448\nU.S. Government Bonds.................................................................................................. 1,485\nJunk Bonds..................................................................................................................... . 1,138\nForeign Exchange Contracts ........................................................................................... 825\nOther.......................................................................................................................... ......      233\n$4,129\nThe common stock profits occurred around the edges of our portfolio – not, as we already\nmentioned, from our selling down our major positions .  The profits in governments arose from our\n\n21liquidation of long-term strips (the most volatile of government securities) and from certain strategies I\nfollow within our finance and financial products division.  We retained most of our junk portfolio, selling\nonly a few issues.  Calls and maturing bonds accounted for the rest of the gains in the junk category.\nDuring 2002 we entered the foreign currency market for the first time in my life, and in 2003 we\nenlarged our position, as I became in creasingly bearish on the dollar.  I should note that  the cemetery for\nseers has a huge section set aside for macro forecasters .  We have in fact made few macro forecasts at\nBerkshire, and we have seldom seen ot hers make them with sustained success.\nWe have – and will continue to have – the bulk of Berkshire’s net worth in U.S. assets.  But in\nrecent years our country’s trade deficit has been fo rce-feeding huge amounts of claims on, and ownership\nin, America to the rest of the world.  For a time, foreign appetite for these assets readily absorbed the\nsupply.  Late in 2002, however, the world started choking on this diet, and the dollar’s value began to slideagainst major currencies.  Even so, prevailing exchange rates will not lead to a material letup in our trade\ndeficit.  So whether foreign investors like it or not, they will continue to be flooded with dollars.  The\nconsequences of this are anybody’s guess.  They coul d, however, be troublesom e – and reach, in fact, well\nbeyond currency markets.\nAs an American, I hope there is a benign ending to this problem.  I myself suggested one possible\nsolution – which, incidentally, leaves Charlie cold – in a November 10, 2003 article in Fortune Magazine.\nThen again, perhaps the alarms I have raised will prove needless: Our country’s dynamism and resiliency\nhave repeatedly made fools of naysayers.  But Berkshire holds many billions of cash-equivalents\ndenominated in dollars.  So I feel more comfortable ow ning foreign-exchange contracts that are at least a\npartial offset to that position.\nThese contracts are subject to accounting rule s that require changes in their value to be\ncontemporaneously included in capital gains or losses, even though the contracts have not been closed.  We\nshow these changes each quarter in the Finance and Financial Products segment of our earnings statement.\nAt yearend, our open foreign exchange contracts totale d about $12 billion at market values and were spread\namong five currencies.  Also, when we were purchasing junk bonds in 2002, we tried when possible to buy\nissues denominated in Euros.  Today, we own about $1 billion of these.\nWhen we can’t find anything exciting in which to  invest, our “default” position is U.S. Treasuries,\nboth bills and repos.  No matter how low the yields  on these instruments go, we never “reach” for a little\nmore income by dropping our credit standards or by ex tending maturities.  Charlie and I detest taking even\nsmall risks unless we feel we are being adequately co mpensated for doing so.  About as far as we will go\ndown that path is to occasionally eat cottage cheese a day after the expiration date on the carton.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nA 2003 book that investor s can learn much from is Bull! by Maggie Mahar.  Two other books I’d\nrecommend are The Smartest Guys in the Room by Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind, and In an Uncertain\nWorld  by Bob Rubin.  All three are well-reported and we ll-written.  Additionally, Jason Zweig last year did\na first-class job in revising The Intelligent Investor , my favorite book on investing.\nDesignated Gifts Program\nFrom 1981 through 2002, Berkshire administered a program whereby shareholders could direct\nBerkshire to make gifts to their favorite charitable orga nizations.  Over the years we disbursed $197 million\npursuant to this program.  Churches were the most frequently named designees, and many thousands ofother organizations benefited as well.  We were the on ly major public company that offered such a program\nto shareholders, and Charlie and I were proud of it.\nWe reluctantly terminated the program in 2003 because of controversy over the abortion issue.\nOver the years numerous organizations on both sides of this issue had been designated by our shareholdersto receive contributions.  As a result, we regularly r eceived some objections to th e gifts designated for pro-\nchoice operations.  A few of these came from people and organizations that proceeded to boycott products\n\n22of our subsidiaries.  That did not concern us.  We refused all requests to limit the right of our owners to\nmake whatever gifts they chose (as long as the recipients had 501(c)(3) status).\nIn 2003, however, many independent  associates of The Pampered Chef began to feel the boycotts.\nThis development meant that people who trusted us – but who were neither employees of ours nor had a\nvoice in Berkshire decision-making – suffered serious losses of income.\nFor our shareholders, there was some modest tax efficiency in Berkshire doing the giving rather\nthan their making their gifts directly.  Additionally, the program was consistent with our “partnership”approach, the first principle set forth in our Owner’s Manual.  But these advantages paled when they were\nmeasured against damage done loyal associates who ha d with great personal effort built businesses of their\nown.  Indeed, Charlie and I see nothing charitable in  harming decent, hard-working people just so we and\nother shareholders can gain some minor tax efficiencies.\nBerkshire now makes no contributions at the parent company level.  Our various subsidiaries\nfollow philanthropic policies consistent with their prac tices prior to their acquisition by Berkshire, except\nthat any personal contributions that former owners had earlier made from their corporate pocketbook are\nnow funded by them personally.\nThe Annual Meeting\nLast year, I asked you to vote as to whether you wished our annual meeting to be held on Saturday\nor Monday.  I was hoping for Monday.  Saturday won by 2 to 1.  It will be a while before shareholderdemocracy resurfaces at Berkshire.\nBut you have spoken, and we will hold this year’s annual meeting on Saturday, May 1 at the new\nQwest Center in downtown Omaha.  The Qwest offers us 194,000 square feet for exhibition by our\nsubsidiaries (up from 65,000 square feet last year) and much more seating capacity as well.  The Qwest’s\ndoors will open at 7 a.m., the movie will begin at 8:30, and the meeting itself will commence at 9:30.\nThere will be a short break at noon for food.  (San dwiches will be available at the Qwest’s concession\nstands.)  That interlude aside, Charlie and I will an swer questions until 3:30.  We will tell you everything\nwe know . . . and, at least in my case, more.\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain\nthe credential you will need for admission to the meeti ng and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car\nreservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  They do\na terrific job for us each year, and I thank them for it.\nIn our usual fashion, we will run vans from the la rger hotels to the meeti ng.  Afterwards, the vans\nwill make trips back to the hotels and to Nebraska Furniture Mart, Borsheim’s and the airport.  Even so,you are likely to find a car useful.\nOur exhibition of Berkshire goods and services will blow you away this year.  On the floor, for\nexample, will be a 1,600 square foot Clayton home (featuring Acme brick, Shaw carpet, Johns-Manville\ninsulation, MiTek fasteners, Carefree awnings, and out fitted with NFM furniture).  You’ll find it a far cry\nfrom the mobile-home stereotype of a few decades ago.\nGEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of\nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes .  In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a\nspecial shareholder discount (usually 8%).  This speci al offer is permitted by 41 of the 49 jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate.  Bring the details of your existin g insurance and check out whether we can save you\nmoney.\nOn Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will ha ve the usual array of aircraft from NetJets®\navailable for your inspection.  Stop by the NetJets boo th at the Qwest to learn about viewing these planes.\nIf you buy what we consider an appropriate number of items during the weekend, you may well need your\nown plane to take them home.\n\n23At Nebraska Furniture Mart, lo cated on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific,\nwe will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” pricing,  which means we will be offering our shareholders a\ndiscount that is customarily given only to employees.  We initiated this special pricing at NFM seven yearsago, and sales during the “Weekend” grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $17.3 million in 2003.  Every year\nhas set a new record.\nTo get the discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, April 29 and Monday,\nMay 3 inclusive, and also present your meeting creden tial.  The period’s special pricing will even apply to\nthe products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting butthat, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have  made an exception for you.  We appreciate their\ncooperation.  NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on\nSunday.  On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., we are having a special affair for shareholders\nonly.  I’ll be there, eating barbeque and drinking Coke.\nBorsheim’s ⎯ the largest jewelry store in the country except for Tiffany’s Manhattan store ⎯ will\nhave two shareholder-only events.  The first will be a co cktail reception from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday,\nApril 30.  The second, the main gala, will be from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday, May 2.  Ask Charlie to\nautograph your sales ticket .\nShareholder prices will be available Thursday thro ugh Monday, so if you wish to avoid the large\ncrowds that will assemble on Friday evening and Sund ay, come at other times and identify yourself as a\nshareholder.  On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m.   Borsheim’s operates on a gross margin that is fully\ntwenty percentage points below that of its major rivals , so the more you buy, the more you save – at least\nthat’s what my wife and daughter tell me.  (Both were impressed early in life by the story of the boy who,after missing a street car, walked home and proudly announced that he had saved 5¢ by doing so.  His\nfather was irate: “Why didn’t you miss a cab and save 85¢?”)\nIn the mall outside of Borsheim’s, we will have  Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the\nworld’s top bridge experts, available to play with our shareholders on Sunday  afternoon.  Additionally,\nPatrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, will be in the mall, taking on all comers ⎯ blindfolded!  I’ve\nwatched, and he doesn’t peek.\nGorat’s ⎯ my favorite steakhouse ⎯ will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on\nSunday, May 2, and will be serving from 4 p.m. until 10  p.m.  Please remember that to come to Gorat’s on\nSunday, you must have a reservation.  To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 1 ( but not before ).  If\nSunday is sold out, try Gorat’s on one of the other evenings you will be in town.  Flaunt your mastery offine dining by ordering, as I do, a rare T-bone with a double order of hash browns.\nWe will have a special reception on Saturday afte rnoon from 4:00 to 5:00 for shareholders who\ncome from outside of North America.  Every year our meeting draws many people from around the globe,\nand Charlie and I want to be sure we personally meet those who have come so far.  Any shareholder who\ncomes from other than the U.S. or Canada will be given special credentials and instructions for attendingthis function.\nCharlie and I have a great time at the annual meeting.  And you will, too.  So join us at the Qwest\nfor our annual Woodstock for Capitalists.\nWarren E. Buffett\nFebruary 27, 2004 Chairman of the Board",

In this table, Berkshire’s results \nthrough 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rule s.  In all other respects, the results are calculated using \nthe numbers originally reported. \nThe S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax  whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax .  If a corporation such as Berkshire \nwere simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appr opriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500 \nin years when that index showed a pos itive return, but would have exceeded the S&P in years when the index showed a \nnegative return.  Over the years, the tax costs woul d have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.  \n\n \n \nBER KSHIR E HATHAWAY  INC. \n \n \nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hath away Inc. : \n \n Our gain in net worth du ring 2004 was $8.3 billion, which increased  the per-share book  value of \nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 10.5%.  Over the last 40 y ears (that is, since present  manage ment \ntook over) book value has grown from  $19 t o $55,824, a rate of 21.9% c ompounded annually.* \n \n It’s pe r-share intrinsic val ue that cou nts, however, not book value.  Here , the news is good: \nBetween  196 4 and 200 4, Berk shire m orphed  from a struggling north ern textile b usiness who se intrinsic \nvalue was less th an book into a diversified en terprise w orth fa r more than book.  Our 40-year gain in \nintrinsic value has there fore s omewhat  exceeded our 21.9% gain in book.  (For an e xplanation of intrinsic  \nvalue and the econ omic pri nciples that guide C harlie Munger, my part ner and B erkshire’s vi ce-chai rman, \nand me in runnin g Berkshire, please r ead our Ow ner’s Manu al, beginning on page 73.) \n \n Desp ite their sh ortco mings, yearly calcu lations of book va lue are  useful at Berk shire as a sligh tly \nunderstated gauge f or measuri ng the long-term  rate o f increase in  our intrinsic v alue.  Th e calcu lations are \nless rel evant, however, than they once we re in rating any single year’s performance v ersus the S&P 500 \nindex (a c omparison we display on the faci ng page).  Our equity holdings (including convertible preferreds) \nhave fallen considerably as a p ercentage of our net wo rth, from an average of 114% in  the 1980s, f or \nexam ple, to less than 50% i n recent years .  There fore, yea rly movem ents in the stoc k market now affe ct a \nmuch smaller p ortion  of ou r net worth  than was once the case, a fact th at will n ormally cau se us to  \nunderperform in years when stocks rise substantially and overperform in years when they fall. \n \n Howe ver the yearly co mparisons work out, Berk shire’s long-term  perform ance vers us the S&P \nremains all-important.  Our shareholders can buy the S&P through an index fund at very low cost.  Unless \nwe ach ieve gains in per-share intrinsic value in the future that ou tdo the S&P, C harlie and  I will b e adding \nnothing to wh at yo u can accom plish on your ow n. \n \n Last year , Berk shire’s boo k-value gain of  10.5% f ell sho rt of the index ’s 10.9% return.  Our \nlackluster performance was n ot due t o any stumbles by  the CEOs o f our operating businesses:  As al ways, \nthey pulled more than their share of th e load .  My m essage to them  is simple: Ru n your business as if it \nwere t he only asset yo ur fam ily will o wn over the next hundred years.  Almost invariably they do  just that \nand, a fter ta king ca re of the needs of their business , send excess cash to Omaha for m e to de ploy. \n \n I didn’t do that job very well last year.  My hope wa s to make several multi-billion dollar \nacquisition s that wou ld add  new and  significan t stream s of earn ings to the many we alread y have.  But I \nstruck out.  Additionally, I found very  few attractiv e securities to  buy.  Berkshire therefo re end ed the year \nwith $43 billion of cash equivalen ts, not a happy position.  Charlie and  I will work to  translate so me of th is \nhoard int o more interesting assets duri ng 2005, t hough we can’t prom ise success. \n \n In one res pect, 2004 was a rem arkable year fo r the stoc k market, a fact burie d in the maze of  \nnumbers on  page 2.  If yo u examine the 35 years sin ce th e 1960s end ed, yo u will find th at an  investor’s \nreturn, including dividends, from owni ng the S&P has a veraged 11.2% annua lly (well above what we  \nexpect future returns to be). Bu t if yo u look for years wi th returns any where close t o that 11.2% – say, \nbetween  8% an d 14% – you will fin d only one before 2004 .  In other words, last year ’s “normal” return is \nanything but. \n \n \n  \n * All fi gures used in t his report ap ply to Berkshi re’s A shares, the successor to the  only stock that  \nthe company had  outstan ding before 1996.  The B shares hav e an econ omic interest equal to  1/30th that of \nthe A. \n 3\n\n Over the 35 ye ars, American bus iness has delivered terrific res ults.  It should therefore have  been \neasy fo r inv estors to earn  juicy retu rns: All th ey h ad to do was piggyback Corporate Am erica in a \ndiversified, low-expense way.  An i ndex fund that they neve r touche d would have done the job.  Instead \nmany invest ors have had experiences ranging from mediocre to disastrous. \n \n There  have been three primary causes:  first, high c osts, usually because inves tors t raded \nexcessi vely or spent far too much on invest ment management; second, portfolio deci sions based on tips and  \nfads rather than on thou ghtful, q uantified  evaluation of businesses; and  third, a star t-and-stop approach to \nthe market marked by untimely en tries (after an adva nce has been long underway ) and exits (a fter periods \nof stagnation or decl ine).  Investors s hould remember that exci tement and expe nses a re their enemies.  And \nif they in sist o n tryin g to time th eir participatio n in equities, th ey sho uld try to  be fearfu l when others are \ngreedy and greedy only when others are fea rful. \n \nSector Results  \n \n As managers, C harlie and I want  to give our owners the financi al information and c ommentary we \nwould wish t o receive if our roles were re verse d.  To do this with both clar ity and reasona ble bre vity \nbecom es more di fficult as B erkshire’s scope widens.  Some of o ur businesses have vast ly different \neconom ic characteristics from others, which means that our consolidated state ments, with  their jumble of \nfigures, make usef ul analysis almost impossible. \n \n On th e following pages, therefore, we will present some balance sheet and earn ings figures from \nour four major categories of businesses  along with commentary ab out each .  We particularly wan t you to \nunderstand  the li mited circum stances un der which we will u se debt, given that we ty pically sh un it.  We \nwill n ot, howev er, in undate yo u with data that has no real value in estimatin g Berk shire’s in trinsic v alue.  \nDoing so would tend to obfuscate the facts  that count. \n \nRegulated Uti lity Businesses  \n \n  We ha ve an 80.5% (fully diluted) interest in MidAm erican Ene rgy Holdings, which owns a wide \nvariety o f utility o peration s.  The larg est of these are (1 ) Yorkshire Electricity  and Northern Electric, wh ose \n3.7 million electric cu stomers m ake it t he third larg est d istribu tor of electricity in  the U.K.; (2) \nMidAm erican Energy, whic h serves 698,000 electric customers,  primarily in Iowa; an d (3) Kern  River and \nNorthern Natural pipelines, which carry 7.9% of the natural gas c onsum ed in the U.S. \n \n  The remaining 19 .5% of MidAmerican i s owned by three partners of ours:  Dave  Sokol and Greg \nAbel, th e brillian t managers of these bu sinesses, an d Walter Sco tt, a long-time frien d of m ine who \nintrodu ced m e to the company.  Becau se MidAmerican  is sub ject to the Pub lic Utility Ho lding Com pany \nAct (“PUHCA”), Berk shire’s voting interest is limited to 9.9%.  Vo ting control rests with Walter. \n \n  Our limited  voting interest forces us to acco unt for Mi dAm erican in an  abbreviated manner.   \nInstead  of our fully in corporating the company’s asse ts, liab ilities, rev enues an d expenses in to Berk shire’s \nstatements, we m ake one-line en tries only in  both our balance sheet and income account.  It’s lik ely, \nthough, t hat PUHC A will someday – perhaps soon – be repeale d or that accoun ting rules will cha nge.  \nBerks hire’s consoli dated figures woul d then in corporate all o f Mid American , including the substan tial d ebt \nit utilizes (th ough this debt is not now, nor will it ev er be, an obligation of Berk shire). \n \n  At yearend , $1.47 8 billion of Mid American ’s junior debt was payable to Berk shire.  This debt has \nallowed acquisitions t o be finance d without our partners nee ding t o increase  their already s ubstantial \ninvestments in MidAmerican .  By ch arging 11% interest, B erkshire is co mpensated  fairly for putting up the \nfunds needed for purchases, wh ile ou r partners are sp ared dilution of th eir equ ity in terests.  Becau se \nMidAmerican  mad e no large acquisition s last year, it p aid down $100 million of what it owes us. \n \n \n \n 4\n\n  MidAmerican  also  own s a significan t non-utility b usiness, Ho meServices o f America, th e second  \nlargest real est ate broker in the country.  Unlike our utility o perations, this bu siness is h ighly cyclica l, but \nnevertheless on e we view enthusiastically.  We have an exceptional manager, Ron  Peltier, wh o through \nboth his acq uisition and operatio nal skills is b uilding a brokerag e powerh ouse. \n \n  HomeServices p articip ated in $59.8 billion of tran sactions in  2004, a gain of $11.2 billio n from \n2003.  About 24% of the increase cam e from six acqui sitions m ade during the year.  Through our 17 \nbrokerage firms –  all o f which retain  their lo cal id entities –  we em ploy more th an 18,000 brok ers in 1 8 \nstates.  Hom eServices is alm ost certa in to grow substantially in the ne xt decade as we c ontinue t o acquire  \nleading localized  operation s. \n \n  Last year Mid American  wrote off a m ajor investment in a zin c reco very p roject th at was in itiated  \nin 1998 and became operation al in 2002.  Larg e quantities o f zinc are presen t in the brin e pro duced by o ur \nCalifornia ge otherm al operat ions, and we believed we c ould profitably extract the metal.  For m any \nmonths, it appeared that commercially- viable recov eries were i mminent.  Bu t in mining, just as in  oil \nexploration, prospects have a way  of “teasing” their developers, and every time one problem was s olved, \nanother popped up.  In September, we t hrew in the towel. \n \n  Our fail ure here illu strates th e importance of a gu ideline – stay with  simp le propositions – that we \nusually ap ply in investments as well as operatio ns.  If only on e variable is k ey to a decision , and the \nvariable has a 90% chance of going your way, the chan ce for a successful  outcom e is obviously 90%.  But \nif ten indepe ndent va riables need to brea k favorably for a successful result, and each has a 90% proba bility \nof success , the likelihood of having a winner is only 35 %.  In our zinc vent ure, we solve d most of the  \nproblem s.  But one prove d intractable, and t hat was one too many.  Since a chai n is no stronger than its \nweake st link, it makes sense t o look for – if you’ll excuse an oxymoron – mono-l inked chains. \n \n  A breakdown of MidA merican’s results fo llows.

Insurance has provided a fountain of funds with \nwhich we’v e acq uired th e secu rities and  businesses th at now give us an ever-wi dening variety of earnin gs \nstream s.  So  in this sectio n, I will b e spending a little ti me telling you how we got where we are. \n \n The s ource of our insurance funds is “float,” which is money  that does n’t belong to us but that we \ntemporarily hold.  Most of our fl oat arises because (1) pre miums are pa id upfront though  the servic e we  \nprovide – insurance protection – i s delivered over a pe riod that usual ly cove rs a y ear and; (2) loss events \nthat occur toda y do not always resu lt in our immediately p aying claim s, because it sometim es takes many \nyears for lo sses to  be repo rted (asb estos lo sses wou ld be an example), negotiated  and settled .  Th e $20 \nmillion of float that came with our 1967 purchase has n ow increase d – bot h by way of internal growth and \nacquisition s – to $46.1 billion. \n \n Float is wonderful – if it doesn’t come at a high price.  Its co st is d etermined by underwritin g \nresults, m eaning how th e expen ses an d losses we will ultimatel y pay com pare with  the premiums we h ave \nreceive d.  Whe n an underwriting profit is achieve d – as has been the case  at Berksh ire in about half of the  \n38 years we have bee n in the insurance  business – float is better than free.  I n such years, we are act ually \npaid for holding other people’s m oney .  For m ost insurers, however, life has been far more di fficult: In \naggre gate, the property-cas ualty industry al most invariabl y operates at  an underwriting loss .  Whe n that \nloss is large, float becomes expe nsive, sometimes devast atingly so. \n \n Insurers have gene rally earned poor returns for a simple reas on: They  sell a com modity-like \nproduct.  Policy forms are st andard, and the product is available from many suppliers, some of whom are \nmutual co mpanies (“o wned” by policyho lders rath er th an stockholders) with profit g oals that are li mited.  \nMoreover, most insureds don’t care f rom whom they buy.  Customers by the millions say “I need some \nGillette b lades” o r “I’ll h ave a Coke” bu t we wait in  vain for “I’d  like a Natio nal Indemnity policy, p lease.”   \nConsequently, price co mpetition in insurance is u sually fierce.  Th ink airline seats. \n \n So, you  may ask , how  do Berkshire’s insuran ce operations overc ome the dism al economics of t he \nindustry an d achieve some measu re of enduring competitiv e advantage?  We’v e attack ed th at problem in \nseveral ways.  Let’s lo ok first at N ICO’s stra tegy. \n \n When we purchased the company – a sp ecialist in  comme rcial au to and general liab ility insurance \n– it did not appear t o have  any attributes that would overcome the industry’s chronic troubles.  It was not \nwell-known, had no informational advantage (the com pany has never had an actuary), was not a low-cost \noperator, and sold through genera l age nts, a method m any people thou ght outdate d.  Neve rtheless, for \nalmost all o f the past 38 years, NICO h as been a star performer.  Ind eed, had we not made this acq uisition, \nBerk shire would be lucky to be wo rth half of what it is tod ay. \n \n What  we’ve had going for us is a managerial mindset  that most insurers find impossi ble to \nreplicate.  Tak e a look at  the facing page.  Can you imagine any public com pany e mbracing a busi ness \nmodel that woul d lead t o the decl ine in revenue that we expe rienced from  198 6 through 1999?  That \ncolossal slide , it shoul d be e mphasized, di d not oc cur b ecause busi ness was unobtaina ble.  Many billions o f \npremium dollars were readily av ailab le to NICO had we only been willing to cut prices.  B ut we i nstead \nconsisten tly priced to make a profit, no t to match  our most optimistic co mpetitor.  We never left cu stomers \n– but they left us. \n \n Most Am erican  businesses harbo r an “institutional imperative” th at rej ects ex tended decreases in \nvolume.  What  CEO want s to repo rt to his share holders that not only did business co ntract last year but  that \nit will  continue to drop ?  In insu rance, the  urge to keep writing busi ness is also intensified because the \nconsequences of foolishly-priced p olicies may not bec ome appare nt for some time.  If a n insurer is \noptimistic in its reserv ing, rep orted earn ings will b e overstated , and years m ay pass before true loss co sts \nare re veale d (a form  of self-de ception that nearly destroyed GEICO in the early 19 70s). \n \n 6\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPortrait of a Discip lined Underwriter \nNational Indemnity Company \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYear  \n \n \nWritten  Premi um \n(In $ millio ns) \n \nNo. of \nEmployees at \nYear -End \nRatio of \nOper ating Expenses \nto \nWritten  Premi umUnderwriting  Profit \n(Loss)  as a Per -\ncentage of  Premiums \n(Calculated as of  \nyear e nd 2004)*  \n \n1980 ........................... $79.6 372 32.3% 8.2% \n1981 ........................... 59.9 353 36.1% (.8%) \n1982 ........................... 52.5 323 36.7% (15.3%) \n1983 ........................... 58.2 308 35.6% (18.7%) \n1984 ........................... 62.2 342 35.5% (17.0%) \n1985 ........................... 160.7 380 28.0% 1.9% \n1986 ........................... 366.2 403 25.9% 30.7% \n1987 ........................... 232.3 368 29.5% 27.3% \n1988 ........................... 139.9 347 31.7% 24.8% \n1989 ........................... 98.4 320 35.9% 14.8% \n1990 ........................... 87.8 289 37.4% 7.0% \n1991 ........................... 88.3 284 35.7% 13.0% \n1992 ........................... 82.7 277 37.9% 5.2% \n1993 ........................... 86.8 279 36.1% 11.3% \n1994 ........................... 85.9 263 34.6% 4.6% \n1995 ........................... 78.0 258 36.6% 9.2% \n1996 ........................... 74.0 243 36.5% 6.8% \n1997 ........................... 65.3 240 40.4% 6.2% \n1998 ........................... 56.8 231 40.4% 9.4% \n1999 ........................... 54.5 222 41.2% 4.5% \n2000 ........................... 68.1 230 38.4% 2.9% \n2001 ........................... 161.3 254 28.8% (11.6%) \n2002 ........................... 343.5 313 24.0% 16.8% \n2003 ........................... 594.5 337 22.2% 18.1% \n2004 ........................... 605.6 340 22.5% 5.1% \n \n*It takes a l ong time to learn the tr ue profitability of any given year.  First, m any clai ms are receive d after \nthe end of t he year, an d we must esti mate how many of these t here will b e and what they will co st.  (In \ninsurance jargon, these claim s are te rmed IB NR – incurred but not reported.)  Sec ond, claims often take \nyears, or eve n decade s, to settle, which m eans there  can be  many su rprises  along t he way. \n \nFor these reason s, the results in  this column simply rep resent o ur best esti mate at the end of  2004 as to  how \nwe have don e in prior year s.  Pro fit margins for the year s thro ugh 1999 are probably close to corr ect \nbecause these years are “m ature,” in the se nse that they have fe w clai ms still outstanding.  The m ore recent \nthe year, th e more guesswork  is invo lved.  In particular, th e resu lts sho wn for 200 3 and 2004 are apt to \nchange sign ifican tly. \n \n \n 7\n\n Finally, there is a fear factor at work , in that a shri nking business us ually leads t o layoffs.  To  \navoid pink slips, em ployees will ration alize in adequate pricin g, tellin g themselves th at poorly-priced \nbusiness m ust be tolerated in order to keep t he organization intact and t he distribution system happy .  If t his \ncourse isn’t follo wed, th ese e mployees will arg ue, the company will  not particip ate in  the reco very th at \nthey inva riably  feel is just around t he corner. \n \n To com bat employees’ nat ural tendency  to save t heir own ski ns, we ha ve al ways prom ised \nNICO’s workforce that no one will be fired because  of declining volu me, howeve r severe the c ontrac tion.  \n(This is  not Donald T rump’s sort of place.)  NICO is not la bor-i ntensi ve, and, as t he tabl e sugge sts, ca n live \nwith excess overhead.  It can ’t live, howev er, with  underpriced business a nd the breakdown in underwriting \ndiscipline t hat accom panies it.  An in suranc e orga nization that doesn’t ca re deeply a bout unde rwriting at a \nprofit this year is un likely to  care next year ei ther. \n \n Naturally, a business th at fo llows a n o-layo ff policy m ust be especia lly careful  to avoid \noverstaffing  when times are go od.  Th irty years ag o Tom Murphy, then CEO of Cap Cities, d rove this point \nhome to me with a hypothetical tale about  an em ployee who asked his boss for permission to hire an  \nassistant.  The employee assu med that adding $20,000 to the annual payroll would be inconsequential.  But \nhis boss told him the proposal should be evaluated as a $3  million decision, given that an  additional person \nwould probably cost  at least that amount over his lifetime, fact oring in raises, be nefits and other expenses \n(more pe ople, more toilet paper).  And unless the com pany fell on very hard times, the em ployee added \nwould be unlikely to be dismissed,  however marginal his contribution to the business. \n \n It takes re al fortitude – em bedde d deep within a company’s cul ture – to operate as NICO does.  \nAnyone exam ining the  table can sca n the years from  1986 to 1999 quickly.  Bu t living day after day with \ndwindling volume – while co mpetitors are b oasting of growth and reaping Wall Street ’s app lause –  is an \nexperience few managers can tolerate.  N ICO, how ever, has had four CEO s since its f ormatio n in 1940 an d \nnone have bent.  (It should be noted that only one of the four graduated from college.  Our experience tells \nus that ex traord inary bu siness ab ility is largely in nate.) \n \n The cu rrent manage rial star – m ake that supe rstar – at NIC O is Do n Wu rster (y es, he’s “the  \ngraduate”), who has bee n running things since 1989.  His slugging perce ntage is right up there with Barry \nBonds’ because, like Barry, Don will accept a walk rathe r than swing at a bad pitch.  Don has now am assed \n$950 million of float at NICO that over tim e is al most certain  to be proved the negative-cost kind.  Becau se \ninsuran ce prices are fallin g, Don’s volume will so on decline very significantly an d, as it does, Charlie an d I \nwill ap plaud him ever more lou dly. \n \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Another way to prosper in a commodity-type business is to be the low-cost operator.  Among a uto \ninsurers op eratin g on a broad scale, GEICO holds that ch erish ed title.  For NIC O, as we have seen , an ebb-\nand-flow business m odel makes se nse.  But a company holding a low-cost advantage m ust pursue an \nunrelenting foot-to-the-floor strategy.  And that’s just what we do at GEICO. \n \n A ce ntury ago, when aut os first appeare d, the property- casualty in dustry operated as a cartel.  Th e \nmajor com panies, most of wh ich were base d in the Nort heast, established “bureau” rat es and t hat was it.  \nNo one cut prices to  attract b usiness.  In stead , insurers co mpeted for str ong, well-re garded agents, a foc us \nthat produced high commissi ons for agents and high prices for consumers. \n \n In 1922, State Farm  was fo rmed by Geo rge Mech erle, a farmer fro m Mern a, Illino is, who  aimed to \ntake adva ntage of t he pri cing umbrella maintained by the high-cost giants of t he industry.  St ate Farm  \nemployed a “cap tive” ag ency force, a system k eeping its acq uisition  costs lo wer t han those incurred  by the \nbureau insurers (whose “i ndependent” agent s successfully played off on e com pany against anot her).  W ith \nits low-c ost structure, State Farm  event ually capture d about 25% of the personal lines (a uto and \nhomeowners) busi ness, far o utdistancing its once -mighty com petitors.  Allstate, formed in 1931, put  a \nsimilar distribution system  into place a nd soon becam e the runner-up in personal lines t o State Farm .  \nCapitalis m had wo rked its m agic, an d these low-co st op eratio ns looked unsto ppable. \n \n 8\n\n But a man nam ed Leo G oodwin had an i dea for an even more efficient auto ins urer and, with a \nskimpy $200,000, started GEICO in 1936.  Goodwin’s plan was t o eliminate the agent entirely and to deal  \ninstead di rectly with the auto ow ner.  Why, he as ked him self, shoul d there be any unnecessary  and  \nexpe nsive links in the distribution mechani sm when t he produ ct, aut o insura nce, was both m andatory and \ncostly.  Purc hasers o f business insurance , he reas oned, might well require professional advi ce, b ut most \nconsum ers kne w what t hey ne eded in a n auto policy.  Th at was a po werful insight. \n \n Originally, GEICO m ailed its low-cost m essage to a limited audience of government employees.  \nLater, it wi dened its horizon s and  shifted its m arketing emphasis to  the phone, wo rking inquiries th at ca me \nfrom broa dcast  and print advertising.  And today the Internet is com ing on strong. \n \n Betw een 1936 and 1975, GEICO grew from a standing sta rt to a 4% m arket sha re, becoming the  \ncountry’s fo urth larg est au to insurer.  Duri ng most of this period, th e company was su perbly managed, \nachieving both excel lent volume gains and high profits.  It looke d unstoppable.  B ut after my friend and  \nhero Lorimer Davi dson retired as C EO in 1970, his suc cesso rs soon made a h uge mistake by  under-\nreserv ing for lo sses.  This produced faulty co st inform ation, which in turn produced inadequate pricing .  By \n1976, GEICO was on  the brink of failure. \n \n Jack Byrne the n joine d GEICO as CE O and, alm ost single-handedly, save d the company by heroic \nefforts t hat inc luded major price incr eases .  Though GEICO’s survi val required these, po licyh olders fled \nthe com pany, and by 1980 its market share  had fal len to 1.8%.  Subsequently, the company embarked on \nsome unwise diversificatio n moves.  This sh ift of emphasis away from  its extraordinary c ore business \nstunted GEIC O’s growth, and by 1993 its market share had grown only fract ionally, to 1.9%.  Then Tony \nNicely took c harge. \n \n And what a differen ce th at’s made: In 2005 GEIC O will p robably secu re a 6% market sh are.  \nBetter yet, To ny has matched growth  with p rofitab ility.  Indeed, GEIC O delivers all of its co nstituen ts \nmajor benefits: In  2004 its cu stomers sav ed $1 billion or so compared to what they wou ld otherwise have \npaid for coverage, its associ ates earn ed a $191 million profit-sharing bonus that averaged 24.3% of salary, \nand its own er – that’s us – enjo yed excellen t financial returns. \n \n There’s more good news.  When Jack Byr ne was re scuing the com pany in 1976, New Je rsey \nrefused to grant him the rat es he neede d to operate profitably.  He t herefore promptly – an d properly – \nwithdre w from  the state.  Subseq uently, GEICO avo ided both New Jersey an d Massachu setts, recogn izing \nthem as two  jurisdictions in which insurers were  destine d to struggle. \n \n In 2003, however, New Je rsey took a new l ook at its chro nic aut o-insurance pr oblems and e nacted \nlegislation that would curb fraud and allow insurers a fai r playing fi eld.  Eve n so, one might have e xpected \nthe state’s bureaucracy t o make change slow and di fficult. \n \n But just the opposite occurred.  Holly Bakke, the New Jersey insurance commissioner,  who would \nbe a success i n any line of work, was determined to turn the law’s in tent into reality.  With her staff’s \ncooperatio n, GEICO iro ned out the details fo r re-en tering the state and was license d last August. Since  \nthen, we’v e receiv ed a respo nse fro m New Jersey  drivers that is m ultiples of m y expectatio ns. \n \n We are n ow serving 140,000 policyholders – abo ut 4% of the Ne w Je rsey market – and sa ving \nthem subst antial sum s (as we do drivers e verywhere).  Word-of-mouth recom mendations wi thin the state \nare causi ng inquiries to pour in.  And once we hea r from a New Jersey  pros pect, our closure rate – the \npercentage of policies issu ed to inquiries receiv ed – is far higher in th e state th an it is nationally. \n \n We m ake no  claim, of co urse, that we can save every one money .  Som e com panies, using rating \nsyste ms that are differen t from o urs, will o ffer certai n classes o f drivers a lower rate than  we do.  Bu t we \nbelieve GE ICO offers the lowest price m ore oft en than any other nationa l company that serves all segments \nof the public.  In a ddition, in m ost states, includi ng Ne w Jersey, Be rkshire share holders recei ve an 8% \ndiscount.  So gam ble fifteen minutes of y our t ime and go  to GEIC O.com – or cal l 800- 847-7536 – to see \n 9\n\nwhet her y ou can save big money  (whi ch you m ight want  to use, of cou rse, to buy other B erkshire \nproducts). \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n \n Reinsu rance – insura nce sol d to othe r ins urers who wish to lay off p art of t he risks they have \nassumed – shou ld not be a commo dity product.  At bottom, any insurance po licy is si mply a pro mise, an d \nas ev eryon e knows, promises v ary eno rmously in their quality. \n \n At th e prim ary in surance lev el, nevertheless, just who makes t he promise is often of m inor \nimportance.  In personal-lines insurance , for exam ple, states levy assess ments on s olvent com panies to pay \nthe po licyho lders of companies th at go  broke.  In the business-insurance fi eld, the sam e arrange ment \napplies to work ers’ compensatio n policies.  “Protected” policies of  these typ es acco unt f or about 60% of  \nthe property-casualty industry’s volume.  Prude ntly-run insurers are irritated  by the need to  subsidize po or \nor reck less m anagement elsewh ere, bu t that’s the way it is. \n \n Other forms of busi ness insurance at  the primary level involve promises that  carry  greater risks for \nthe ins ured.  Whe n Relianc e Ins urance a nd Home Insu rance we re run into the  ground, for e xample, their \npromises prov ed to be w orthless.  C onsequently, many holders o f their business policies (other than those \ncove ring workers’ compensat ion) suffered  painful losses. \n \n The solvency risk  in primary policies, however, pales in compariso n to that lurking in reinsuran ce \npolicies.  Whe n a rei nsurer goes broke, stag gering losses almost always strik e the primary companies it h as \ndealt with .  Th is risk  is far from minor: GEICO has suffered  tens of millio ns in losses fro m its care less \nselection of reinsurers in the e arly 1980s. \n \n Were a tru e meg a-catastrop he to  occur in th e next decade or two – and that’s a real possib ility –  \nsome rein surers wou ld not survive.  Th e larg est in sured loss to  date is th e World Trad e Cen ter disaster,  \nwhich cost the insurance indu stry an estimated  $35 billion .  Hurrican e Andrew co st insurers abou t $15.5 \nbillion in 1992 (th ough that loss wo uld be far h igher in today’s do llars).  Bo th events rocked the insuran ce \nand reinsurance wo rld.  But a $100 billion event, or even  a larg er catastrop he, rem ains a possibility if ei ther \na particula rly severe ea rthqua ke or hurrica ne hits just  the wrong place.  Four si gnificant hurricanes struck \nFlorida during 2004, cau sing an  aggreg ate of $25 billion or so in insured losses.  Two o f these – Charley  \nand Ivan – could have done at least three times the dam age they did had they entered the U.S . not far from \ntheir actual landing points. \n \n Many insurers regard a $100 billion industry loss as “u nthinkable” and  won’t ev en plan for it.  Bu t \nat Berkshi re, we are ful ly prepared.  Our share of t he loss would probably be 3% t o 5%, and ear nings from \nour i nvestm ents and other businesses woul d com fortably e xceed that cost.  Whe n “the day after”  arrives, \nBerk shire’s check s will clear. \n \n Though the hurrican es hit us with  a $1 .25 billion loss, ou r reinsurance operations did well last \nyear.  At Gene ral Re, Joe Bra ndon has re stored a long -admired culture of u nderwritin g discip line that, fo r a \ntime, had l ost its way .  The excellent results he realized i n 2004 on current business, however, were offset \nby adve rse d evelopments from the years befo re he t ook the helm .  At  NIC O’s rei nsurance o peration, Ajit \nJain continues to succes sfully underwrite huge risks that no other reinsurer is willing or a ble to ac cept.  \nAjit’s v alue to Berk shire is eno rmous. \n \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n \n Our insuran ce managers, m aximizin g the competitiv e strengths I’v e mentioned in this section , \nagain delivered first-class un derwritin g results last year.  As a c onsequence , our float was bet ter than \ncostless.  Here’s the sc orecard: \n 10\n\n \n \n (in $ millio ns) \n Underwriting  Profit Yearend Float \nInsurance Ope rations 2004 2004 2003 \nGene ral Re .......................  $       3 $23,120 $23,654 \nB-H Rei nsurance..............  417 15,278 13,948 \nGEIC O.............................  970 5,960 5,287 \nOthe r Primary*.................       161     1,736     1,331 \nTotal .................................  $1,551 $46,094 $44,220 \n \n*Includes, in addition to National Indemnity, a v ariety o f other exceptional insurance businesses, \nrun by Rod Eldred, John Kizer, Tom Nerney and Don T owle. \n \n Berk shire’s float in creased  $1.9 billion in 2004, even though a few insu reds opted to commute \n(that is, unwind) certain reinsurance c ontracts.  We agree to such commutations o nly when we believe the \necon omics are favorable to us (after giving due weight to what  we might earn in the future on the money \nwe are returning). \n \n To summarize, last year we were p aid more th an $1.5 billion to hold an av erage of about $45.2 \nbillion.  In 2005 pricin g will b e less attract ive than it has been.  Nevertheless, ab sent a mega-catastrop he, \nwe have  a dece nt chance of achieving no-cost float again this year. \n \nFinance  and F inance Produc ts \n \n Last year in  this sectio n we d iscussed a potpourri of activities.  In  this report, we’ll sk ip over \nseveral  that are now of lesser importance:  Berkadia is do wn to tag ends; Value Capital h as added other \ninvest ors, negating o ur expectation that we wo uld nee d to consolidate its fin ancials in to ours; and th e \ntrading operation that I run  continues to shri nk. \n \n• Both of Berk shire’s leasin g operation s rebo unded last year.  At CORT (office furniture), earnings  \nremain inadeq uate, but are t rending upward.  XTRA disposed of its container and intermodal \nbusinesses in  order to concentrate on  trailer leasin g, long  its stro ng suit.  Ov erhead h as been \nreduced, asset u tilizatio n is u p and decent profits are now b eing achieved under Bill  Fran z, the \ncompany’s ne w CEO. \n \n• The wind -down of Gen Re Secu rities con tinues.  We decided  to exit this derivative operatio n three \nyears ag o, but getting out is easier said th an done.  Tho ugh derivative instruments are purported t o \nbe hi ghly liquid – an d though we hav e had the benefit of a beni gn m arket while liquidating ours – \nwe still h ad 2,8 90 contracts outstanding at yearend , down from 23,218 at th e peak.  Like Hell, \nderivative trad ing is easy to en ter but difficult to  leave.  (Ot her similarities  come to mind as well.) \n \nGen Re’s derivative contracts have  always been re quired to be marked to mark et, an d I believ e the \ncompany’s managem ent conscientiously tried to make rea listic “marks.”  The  market prices of \nderivatives, however, can  be v ery fuzzy in a world  in which settlemen t of a tran saction  is \nsometimes d ecades away and o ften involves multiple variables as well.  In  the interim  the marks \ninfluence t he manageri al and trading bonuses t hat are paid annually.  It’s s mall wonde r that \nphantom profits are often recorded. \n \nInvestors should  und erstan d that in  all types of  financial institutions, rap id grow th sometimes \nmasks m ajor u nderlying problems (and occasionally fraud).  The re al test of the earning power of \na derivatives operation  is what it ach ieves after operating for an  extended  period in a no-growth \nmode.  Y ou only learn who has bee n swimming na ked when the tide goes out. \n \n• After 40  years, we’v e finally generated a little sy nergy at B erkshire: Clayto n Ho mes is do ing well \nand that’s in part due to its asso ciatio n with Berkshire.  The manufactured ho me industry \n 11\n\ncontinues to reside in the intensive care unit of Corporate America, havi ng sold less than 135,000 \nnew ho mes last year, abou t the sam e as in  2003.  Volume in  these y ears was th e lowest since \n1962, and it was al so only abo ut 40% of  ann ual sales d uring the year s 1995-99.  That era, \ncharact erized by irresponsible financing and naïve funders, was a  fool’s paradise for the industry.  \n \nBecause one major le nder after anot her has fle d the field, fi nancing continues t o bedevil \nmanufact urers, retailers an d purchasers of manufact ured homes.  He re Berkshire’s support has \nproven valuable to Clayton.  We stand ready  to fund whatever makes sen se, an d last year  \nClayton’s m anagem ent found much that qualified. \n \nAs we explained  in our 2003 r eport, we believe in using  borrowed money to  support profitable, \ninterest-beari ng receiva bles.  At the be ginning of last year, we ha d borrowed  $2 billion to relend to \nClayto n (at a one percentage-point markup) and by Janu ary 2005 the total was $7.35 billion.  M ost \nof the dollars added were borrowed by us on January 4, 2005, to finance a seaso ned portfolio that \nClayton purc hased on December 30, 200 4 from  a bank e xiting t he business. \n \nWe no w have two additional portfolio purchases in  the wo rks, totaling  about $1.6 billion, but it’s \nquite unlikely that we will secure others of a ny significa nce.  There fore, C layton’s recei vables (in \nwhich originations will roughly offset p ayoffs) will probab ly ho ver arou nd $9 billion for so me \ntime and shou ld deliver steady earn ings.  This p attern will b e far differen t from that of the past, in  \nwhic h Clayton, like all major players in its i ndustry, “securitized ” its receivables , causing earni ngs \nto be fro nt-ended .  In th e last two years, th e securitizatio n mark et has dried up.  The limited  funds \navailable today com e onl y at higher cost and with harsh terms.  Ha d Clayton rem ained \nindependent in this period, it would have had mediocre ea rnings as  it struggled with financing. \n \nIn April, Clayto n completed  the acq uisition of Oakwood Homes and is now th e industry’s larg est \nproduce r and retailer of m anufact ured homes.  We l ove putting more asse ts in the han ds of Ke vin \nClayton, the company’s CEO.  He is a prototype Berkshire manager.  Today , Clayton has 11,837 \nemployees, up from 7,136 when we purchased it, and Charlie and I are pleased t hat Berkshire has \nbeen usefu l in facilitatin g this growth. \n \nFor sim plicity’s sak e, we include all of Clayto n’s earnings in this sector, t hough a sizabl e portion \nof these a re derived from areas ot her than consum er finance . \n \n(in $ millio ns) \nPre-Tax E arnings Interest-Bea ring Liabilities  \n 2004 2003 2004 2003 \nTradi ng  – ordinary i ncome............................  $   264 $   355 $5,751 $7,826 \nGen Re Sec urities...........................................

By Dece mber, for e xample, steel costs at MiTek (whose prim ary busi ness is \nconnector s for roof trusses)  were running 100% over a year earlier.  And MiTek  uses 665  million \npounds of steel every  year.  Nevertheless, the company continues to be an outstanding performer.  \n 13\n\nSince we purchased MiTek  in 2001, Gene Toombs, its CEO, h as made some brilliant “bo lt-on ” \nacquisition s and is on his way  to creatin g a mini-Berk shire. \n \n Shaw fielded a barrage of price increases in its main fiber materials during the year, a hit that added \nmore th an $300 million to its co sts.  (Wh en you  walk on ca rpet y ou are, in effect, stepping on \nprocesse d oil.)  Though we fo llowed these hi kes in costs with price increa ses of  our own, there was an \ninevitable lag.  There fore, margins narrowed as the year pr ogresse d and remain under pressure today.  \nDespi te these roadblocks, S haw, l ed by Bob Sha w and Julian Saul , earn ed an o utstanding 25.6% on \ntangible equity in 2004.   The com pany is a powerhouse and h as a bright future. \n \n• In apparel, Fru it of th e Loom  increased un it sales b y 10 million dozen, or 14%, wit h shipments of \nintimate appar el for women and girls growing by 31%.  Charlie, who is far more knowledgea ble than I \nam on this subject, ass ures me that wom en are not weari ng more underwear.  With t his expe rt input , I \ncan only conclude that our market share in the wom en’s ca tegory must be gr owing rapidly.  Tha nks to \nJohn Holland , Fru it is on  the move. \n \nA sm aller ope ration, Gara n, also had an excel lent year.  Le d by Seymour Li chtenstein and Jerry \nKam iel, this company manufactures t he popular Garanimals line for children.  Next time you are  in a \nWal-Mart, check out this im aginative product. \n \n• Among our re tailers, Ben Bridge (jewelry) and R. C . Willey (hom e furnishi ngs) were  particula r \nstandouts last year. \n \nAt Ben Bridge sam e-store sal es grew 11.4%, the best  gain among t he publicly-held jewelers whose \nreports I have seen.  Additionally, th e company’s profit marg in widened.  Last year was no t a fl uke: \nDuring t he past decade , the same-store sale s gains  of the  com pany have a verage d 8.8%. \n \n Ed an d Jon B ridge a re fourth-generation manage rs and run the business e xactly as if it were t heir own \n– which it is in every res pect excep t for Berkshire’s name on the stock ce rtificates.  The  Bridges h ave \nexpa nded successful ly by securing the right locations an d, more im portantly, by staffing these st ores \nwith enthusiastic an d kno wledg eable asso ciates.  We will mo ve into Minn eapolis-St. Pau l this year. \n \nAt Utah -based R. C. Willey, the gains from expansion have been even more dram atic, with 41.9% of \n2004 sales coming fr om out-of-state stores that didn’t exi st before 1999.  The com pany also im prove d \nits profit margin in 200 4, propelled  by its two n ew stores in Las Veg as. \n \n I would like to tell you that these sto res were my idea.  In truth, I tho ught they were m istakes.  I knew, \nof course, how b rillian tly Bill  Child had run the R. C. Willey o peration in Utah , where its market share \nhad l ong been huge.  B ut I felt our cl osed-on-Sunday policy woul d prove disastrous away from  hom e.  \nEven our first out-of-state store in Boise, which was highly successf ul, left me uncon vinced.  I kept \nasking whether Las Ve gas r esidents, conditioned t o seve n-day-a-week retailers, w ould adjust to us. \nOur first Las  Vegas store, ope ned in 2001, answered this question in a re sounding m anner, \nimmediately becom ing ou r number one unit. \n \n Bill and Sc ott Hym as, his successor as CEO, t hen proposed a sec ond Las Ve gas st ore, only about 20 \nminutes away .  I fel t this expansion would canni balize the first unit, adding si gnificant cost s but only \nmodest sales.  The result? Each  store is now do ing about 26% more volume th an any other store in the \nchain and is con sisten tly showing  large year-o ver-year gains. \n \n R. C. Willey will soo n open in Reno .  Befo re making this co mmitment, Bill an d Sco tt again asked for \nmy ad vice.  Initiall y, I was pretty p uffed up abo ut the fact that they were con sulting me.  But then it \ndawned on me that the opi nion of som eone wh o is always wrong has its o wn special u tility to decisio n-\nmakers. \n \n \n 14\n\n• Earni ngs improved in flight servi ces.  At FlightSafet y, the world ’s leader in  pilot trainin g, profits ro se \nas cor porate av iation rebound ed and  our business with reg ional air lines in creased .  We now operate \n283 simulators with  an orig inal co st of $1.2 billion.  Pilo ts are train ed one at a time o n this exp ensive \nequipment.  Thi s means t hat as much as $3 .50 of ca pital investment is requ ired to produce $1 o f annual \nrevenue.  With th is lev el of capital in tensity, Flig htSafety requi res ve ry high operating margins in order \nto obtain reason able ret urns on capital, wh ich means that utilizat ion rates are all-i mportant.  Last year, \nFlightSafety’s return on tangible equity improve d to 15.1% from 8.4%  in 2003. \n \nIn another 2004 event, Al Ueltsch i, wh o foun ded FlightSafety in  1951 with $10,000, turned ov er th e \nCEO po sition  to Bruce Whitman, a 43-year v eteran  at th e company.  (B ut Al’s not going anywhere; I \nwon’t let h im.)  Bru ce sh ares Al’s conv iction that flyin g an aircraft is a p rivilege to be exten ded only to \npeople who re gularly receive  the highest quality of traini ng and are undenia bly com petent.  A few \nyears ag o, Charlie was as ked to intervene with Al on behalf of a tycoon friend whom FlightSafet y had \nflunked.  Al’s reply to Charlie: “Tell yo ur pal he belongs in the back of the plane, not t he cockpit.” \n \nFlightSafety’s num ber o ne customer is NetJets, ou r aircraft fract ional-ownership subsidiary.  Its 2,100 \npilots sp end an average of 18 days a year i n training.  Additionally, th ese p ilots fly on ly one aircraft  \ntype whe reas many flight operations juggle pilots among seve ral types.  Net Jets’ high st andards on \nboth fronts are two of the reasons I signed up with the company years before Berkshire bought it. \n \n Fully as im portant in my decisions t o both use a nd buy Net Jets, ho weve r, was t he fact  that the \ncompany was man aged by Rich  Santulli, th e creato r of the fraction al-ownersh ip industry and a fan atic \nabout safety and service.  I vi ewed the selection of a flight provider as a kin to picking a brai n surgeon: \nyou si mply want the best.  (Let som eone el se experiment with the low bidder.) \n \n Last year NetJ ets again gaine d about 70% of the net new bu siness (measur ed by dollar value) going to \nthe four c ompanies that dominate the ind ustry.  A portion o f our growth cam e from the 25-hour card  \noffered by Marquis Jet  Partners.  M arquis is not owned by NetJets, but is instead a customer that \nrepackages the purchases it makes from us into smaller packages that it sells th rough its card.  Marqu is \ndeals ex clusively with  NetJets, u tilizin g the power of our rep utation  in its mark eting. \n \n Our U. S. co ntracts, including M arquis cust omers, gre w from 3,87 7 to 4,967 in 2004 ( versus \napproximately 1,200 contracts whe n Berkshire bought NetJets in 1998).  Some clients (incl uding me) \nenter into m ultiple contract s because they wish to use more tha n one type of airc raft, selecting for any \ngiven trip whicheve r type best fits the mission at  hand. \n \n NetJets ear ned a m odest  amount in the U.S. last year.  But what we ea rned domestically was l argely \noffset by losses in Europe.  We are  now, however, generating real momentum abroa d.  Contracts \n(including 25-hour cards that we ourselves market in Europe) increase d from 364 to 693 during the \nyear.  We will ag ain have a very significant Eu ropean loss in  2005, but domestic earn ings will lik ely \nput us in the black ove rall. \n \n Europe has been ex pensive for NetJets – fa r more expe nsive than I ant icipated – but it is essent ial to \nbuilding a fligh t operation  that will fo rever be in a class by itself.  Our U.S. owners alread y wan t a \nquality serv ice wh erever they trav el an d their wish  for fligh t hours ab road is certain  to grow \ndram atically in the decades a head.  Last yea r, U.S.  owners made 2,003 flights in E urope, up 22% from \nthe pre vious year an d 137% from 2000.  Ju st as im portant, our European owners m ade 1, 067 flights in \nthe U.S., up 65% fr om 2003 and 239 % from 2000. \n \n 15\n\nInves tments \n \n We sh ow below our common st ock i nvestments.

Charlie and I ignore such distractions \nand i nstead view o ur holdings as fract ional owne rships in businesse s.  Thi s is an impo rtant distinction.  \nIndeed, this thinking has bee n the cor nerstone of m y investment behavi or since I was 19.  At  that time I \nread Be n Gra ham’s The Intelligent Investo r, and the scale s fell from  my ey es.  (P reviously, I had been \nentranced by the stock market, but didn’t have a cl ue about how to invest.) \n \n Let’s loo k at ho w the businesses of our “Big  Four” – American  Express, Co ca-Co la, Gillette an d \nWells Farg o – have fared  since we bo ught into these co mpanies.  As the tab le shows, we in vested $3.83 \nbillion in the four, by way o f multiple tran sactio ns between May 1 988 and Octob er 2003.  On  a co mposite \nbasis, our dollar-weighted purchase dat e is July 1992.  By yearend 2 004, therefore, we had held these \n“business in terests,” on  a wei ghted basis, about 12½ years. \n \n In 2004, Be rkshire’s share of the group’s earnings am ounte d to $1.2 billion.  T hese earnings  might \nlegiti mately be  conside red “norm al.”  True, they were swelled because Gillette and Wells Fargo omitted \noption c osts in their prese ntation of earnings ; but on the ot her ha nd they were re duce d because Coke had a \nnon-recurring write-off. \n \n Our sha re of t he earni ngs of these f our com panies has grown almost every  year, and n ow amounts \nto about 31.3% o f our cost.  Th eir cash  distr ibutions to us have also  grown consisten tly, to taling $434 \nmillion in 2004, or about 11.3% of cost.  All in all, th e Big Fou r have delivered us a satisf actory, tho ugh f ar \nfrom  spectacular, business  result. \n \n That’s tru e as well o f our exp erience in  the market with  the group .  Since o ur orig inal purchases, \nvaluation gai ns have s omewhat exceede d earni ngs growth  because price/e arnings ratios have inc reased.  On \na year-to-year basi s, however, the business and m arket performances hav e often diverged, sometimes to an \nextra ordina ry degree.  Duri ng The Great Bubble, market-value gains far outstripped the performance of the \nbusinesses .  In the afterm ath of the  Bubble, t he reverse was true. \n 16\n\n Clearly, Berkshire’s results would have be en fa r better if I had caugh t this swing  of th e pendulum.  \nThat m ay see m easy to do when one look s through an always-clean, rear-view mirror.  Unfort unately, \nhowever, it’s the windshield through which invest ors must peer, a nd that glass is invariably fogged.  Our \nhuge positions add to the difficulty of our nimbly danci ng in and out of holdings as valuations s wing. \n \nNevertheless, I can  prop erly b e criticized  for m erely c lucking about nose-bleed valuation s during  \nthe Bubble rather t han acting on m y views.  Though I said at the tim e that certain of the stocks we held \nwere priced a head of them selves, I undere stimated just  how sev ere the overvaluation  was.  I talk ed when I \nshould have  walked. \n \n What Charlie an d I wou ld like is a lit tle act ion now.  We don’t enj oy sittin g on $43 billion of cash \nequivalents that are earni ng paltry returns.  Instead, we yearn  to buy mo re fraction al interests simila r to \nthose we no w own or – better still  – more larg e businesses outright.  We will d o either, however, only wh en \npurchases ca n be m ade at  prices that offer us the prospect of a reasonable return on our investment. \n \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n We’ve re peate dly emphasized that  the “rea lized” gains that we re port quarterly or annually ar e \nmeaningless for analytical purposes.   We have a huge amount of unrealized gains on our books, and our \nthinking about when, an d if, to cash  them depends not at all on a desire to repo rt earn ings at one specific  \ntime or anot her.  A f urther c omplication in our rep orted gains occ urs because G AAP requires that foreign \nexcha nge contracts be m arked to m arket, a stipula tion that cau ses unrealized  gains or losses in  these \nholdings to flow through our published earnings as if we had sold our positions.   \n \n Despi te the problems enum erated, y ou may be i nterested in a breakdown of the gains we reported \nin 2003 and  2004.  Th e data r eflect actual sales exce pt in the cas e of cu rrency gains, which are a \ncombination of sales and marks to market. \n \nCategory Pre-Ta x Gain (in $ millio ns) \n 2004 2003 \nCom mon Stoc ks.............................  $   870 $   448 \nU.S. Gover nment Bonds .................  104 1,485 \nJunk B onds.....................................  730 1,138 \nForeign E xchange Cont racts ...........  1,839 825 \nOthe r...............................................

When we bought these bonds in \n2001 and 200 2, we fo cused fi rst, of course, on the cred it quality o f the issu ers, all of which were Am erican  \ncorporations.  Some of t hese com panies, however, had issued bonds denominated in foreign currencies.  \nBecause of our views on the dolla r, we favored the se for purchase  whe n they were  availa ble. \n \n As an e xample, we b ought €254 million of  Level  3 bonds (10 ¾% of 2008) in 2001 at  51.7% of  \npar, and s old these at 85% of par in December 2004.  T his issue was tra ded in Euro s tha t cost us  88¢ at  the \ntime of purchase bu t that brou ght $1.29 when  we sold.  Thus, of our $163 million overall gain, abo ut $85 \nmillion cam e fro m the market’s rev ised opinion about Lev el 3’s cred it quality, with  the rem aining $78 \nmillion resulting from  the a ppreciati on of the Euro.

Lou Si mpson manages about $2½ \nbillion of eq uities th at are held  by GEICO, and  it is h is tran saction s that Berk shire is u sually rep orting.  \nCustomarily his pu rchases ar e in the $200-$300 million range a nd are i n com panies t hat are sm aller than \nthe ones I foc us on.  Ta ke a look at the fa cing page to see wh y Lo u is a cin ch to be inducted into the \ninvest ment Hall of Fam e. \n \n You may be sur prised to learn t hat Lou does not  necessa rily inform  me about what  he is doing.  \nWhen Charlie an d I assign  resp onsibility, we tru ly hand over the baton – and we give it to Lou just as we \ndo to our operating managers.  Th erefore, I typically lear n of Lou ’s transaction s about ten  days af ter the \nend of each month.  Sometimes, it should be adde d, I silently disagree with his decisions.  But he’s usuall y right. \n \nForeign Curr encies \n \n Berks hire owned about $21.4 billi on of foreign exc hange cont racts at yearend, s pread among 12 \ncurrencies.  As I mentioned last year, hol dings of this kind are a deci ded cha nge for us.  B efore M arch \n2002, neither Berkshire nor I had ever traded in curren cies.  Bu t the evidence grows th at our trade policies  \nwill p ut unremit ting pressure on  the dollar for m any years to  come – so since 20 02 we’v e heeded that \nwarning in setting our investment cour se.  (As W.C. Fields once sai d when asked for a ha ndout: “Sor ry, \nson, all m y money’s tied up  in currency.”)  \n \n Be clear on o ne point: In no way  does our thinking about currencies rest on doubts about America.  \nWe liv e in an extraordinarily rich  country, the product of a syste m that values m arket econom ics, the rule \nof law a nd equality of opportunity.  Our econom y is far and away th e strongest in the world a nd will \ncontinue to be.  We are lu cky to live here. \n \n But as I argue d in a No vember 10, 2003 art icle in Fortune, (avai lable at berkshirehathaway.com), \nour country’s trade practices are we ighing d own the dollar.  Th e declin e in its v alue has alread y been  \nsubstan tial, but is n evertheless lik ely to  continue.  Withou t policy ch anges, curren cy mark ets cou ld even \nbecome disorderly an d generate sp illover effects, bo th political an d financial.  No  one knows wh ether these \nproblems will materialize.  But such a scen ario is a far-from -remote possibility that policymakers sho uld be \nconsideri ng now.  Thei r bent, however, is to lean t oward not-so-benign neglect: A 318-page  Congressional \nstudy of the consequences of un remitting trad e deficits was published in Nov ember 2000 and has been \ngathering  dust ev er sin ce.  The stu dy was o rdered after th e deficit h it a th en-alarm ing $263 billion in 1999; \nby last year it had risen  to $61 8 billion. \n \n Charlie and  I, it sh ould be emp hasized , believe that true tra de – that is, the excha nge of goods and \nservi ces with other countries – is enormously benefi cial for both us an d them.  Last  year we ha d $1.15 \ntrillio n of such honest-to-God trad e and  the more of this, th e better.  Bu t, as n oted, o ur cou ntry also \npurchased an ad ditional $6 18 billion in g oods and  serv ices fro m the rest of the world  that was \nunreciprocate d.  That is a staggeri ng figur e and one t hat has  importa nt consequences .  \n \n The balancing item to this one-way p seudo-trad e — in  econ omics th ere is always an  offset — is a  \ntransfer of wealth  from the U.S. to  the rest of th e world.  Th e tran sfer m ay materialize in the form  of IOUs  \nour private o r governmental institutions give to foreign ers, or by way o f their assuming ownership of o ur \nassets, s uch as  stoc ks and real estate.  In e ither case, Am ericans e nd up owni ng a reduced por tion of our \ncountry wh ile non-Americans own a greate r part.  This force-feedi ng of American  wealth  to the rest of th e \nworld  is now p roceeding at th e rate of $1 .8 billion daily, an  increase of 2 0% sin ce I wrote you  last year.  \nConsequently, other cou ntries an d their citiz ens now own  a net of about $3 trillio n of the U.S.  A decade \nago their net ownership was  negl igible. \n \n The mention of trillio ns numbs most brains.  A furth er source of con fusion is th at th e current \naccount deficit (the  sum  of three item s, the m ost im porta nt by fa r being t he trade deficit) a nd our national \nbudget deficit  are ofte n lum ped as “twins.”  T hey are any thing but.  They  have different cause s and \ndifferent consequences. \n \n 19\n\n A budget deficit in  no way reduces the por tion of the national pie that goes to  Americans.  As long \nas other countries and their citizens have no net  ownership of the U.S ., 100% of o ur country’s output \nbelongs to ou r citizen s under any budget scenario, even one involving a huge defi cit. \n \n As a rich  “famil y” awash  in goo ds, Am erican s will argu e through their leg islato rs as to  how \ngovernment shoul d redistribute the nat ional output – that is who pay s taxes and who rece ives governmental \nbenefits.  If “en titlement” promises fro m an earlie r day have to b e reex amined, “fam ily members” will \nangrily d ebate among themselves as t o who feels t he pain.  Mayb e tax es will g o up; maybe pro mises will \nbe modified; mayb e more internal debt will b e issu ed.  Bu t when the figh t is fin ished, all of the fa mily’s \nhuge pie remains available for its members, ho wever it is divided.  No slice must be sent  abroad. \n \n Large a nd persisting curre nt account de ficits produ ce an e ntirely differe nt result.  As time passes, \nand a s claim s against us grow, we own less and less of what we produce.  In eff ect, the rest of the world \nenjoys an  ever-growing royalty o n Am erican  output.  Here, we are lik e a fam ily that co nsisten tly \noverspends its income.  As time p asses, th e fam ily finds that it is w orking more an d more fo r the “finance  \ncompany” and less for itself. \n \n Should we con tinue to run current acco unt d eficits co mparable to those now prev ailing, the net \nowne rship of the U.S. by other co untries a nd their citizens  a decade fr om now will am ount to roughly $11 \ntrillio n.  And, if fo reign investors were to  earn  only 5% on that net holding, we would need  to send  a net o f \n$.55 trillio n of go ods and  serv ices ab road every year  merely to  serv ice the U.S. inv estments then held by \nforeigners.  At that date, a decade out, our GDP would probably total about $18 trillion (assum ing low \ninflation, which is far fr om a sure t hing).  Therefore, our U.S . “fam ily” would then be delivering 3% of i ts \nannual ou tput to the rest o f the wo rld simply as tri bute for the overi ndulgences of t he past.  In t his case, \nunlike that involving budget deficits, the son s would truly pay for the sins of th eir fat hers. \n \n This annual royalty paid the wo rld – which wo uld not disappear unless t he U.S . massively \nunderconsumed an d began t o run co nsistent and large trade s urpluses – would undoubtedly produce \nsignifican t political u nrest in  the U.S.   Americans wou ld still b e living very well, in deed better th an now \nbecause of the growth i n our econom y.  But they woul d chafe at the ide a of pe rpetually paying tribut e to \ntheir creditors and owners  abroad.  A cou ntry th at is n ow aspiring to an “Own ership Society” will n ot find \nhappiness in – and I’ll use hyperbole here for emphasi s – a “Sha recropper’s Society.”  But that’s precisely \nwhere our trade po licies, supp orted b y Repu blicans a nd De mocrats alike, are ta king us. \n \n Many prominent U.S . financial figures , both in and out of g overnment, have st ated that our \ncurrent-account d eficits can not persist.  For  instance, the minutes of the Fed eral Reser ve Open Mar ket \nCommittee of Jun e 29-30, 2004 say : “The s taff n oted that outsized ext ernal deficits coul d not be sust ained \nindefinitely.”  But, despite the con stant handwring ing by luminaries, th ey offer no substan tive suggestions \nto tame the burgeoning imbalance. \n \n In the article I wrote for Fortune 16 months ago, I warned that “a gently decl ining dollar wo uld \nnot provide the ans wer.”  And so far it hasn’t.  Yet policymakers c ontinue t o hope for a “s oft landing,” \nmean while cou nseling other countries t o stim ulate (read  “inflate”) t heir econom ies and Americans to s ave \nmore.  In my view these admonitions miss the mark:  There are deep-rooted structural p roblems that will  \ncause Am erica to continue  to run a huge curre nt-acc ount deficit unless trade  poli cies either c hange \nmateriall y or the dollar d eclines by a degree th at cou ld prove unsettlin g to financial m arkets. \n \n Proponents of the trade st atus quo are f ond of q uoting A dam Smith: “What  is prudence in the \nconduct of eve ry fam ily can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom.  If a fo reign country can s upply us \nwith a c ommodity cheape r than we oursel ves ca n make it, b etter bu y it o f them with so me part of the \nproduce  of our own industry, employed in a way  in which we have  some adva ntage.” \n \n I agree.  Note , however, that M r. Smith’s s tatem ent refers  to tra de of product for product, not of \nwealth for product as our cou ntry is d oing to the tune of $.6 trillio n annu ally.  Mo reover, I am  sure that he \nwould never have suggest ed that “prudence” consisted of his “fam ily” selling off part of its farm ever y day \n 20\n\nin order to finance its ov erconsu mption.  Yet th at is j ust what th e “great kingdom” called  the Un ited States  \nis do ing. \n \n If the U.S. was ru nning a $.6 trillio n curren t-acco unt surplus, commentators w orldwide wo uld \nviolently conde mn our policy, v iewing it as an  extreme form  of “mercantilism ” – a long-discredited  \necon omic strategy  under which countries fostered exports, discouraged imports, and piled up treasure.  I \nwould condemn s uch a policy as well.  But, in  effect if not in intent, the rest of th e world  is practicing \nmercan tilism in resp ect to the U.S., an  act made possible by our vast store of assets and  our pristin e credit \nhistory.  Indeed, the world would never let any other country use a  credit card denominated in its own \ncurrency to t he insatiable extent we  are e mploying ou rs.  Prese ntly, most foreign investors a re san guine: \nthey m ay view us as sp ending junkies, but they know we are rich junkies as well. \n \n Our spendthrift beha vior won’t, however, be tolerated indefinitely.  And t hough it’s impossi ble to \nforecast just when a nd how t he trade proble m will be resolve d, it’s improbable that the resoluti on will \nfoster an increase in the value of our c urrency relative to that of our trading partners.   \n \n We hop e the U.S. adop ts policies th at will  quickly and  substantially  reduce t he current-acc ount \ndeficit.  Tru e, a p rompt solution would likely cau se Berk shire to  record  losses on  its forei gn-exchange  \ncontracts.  But  Berks hire’s re sources  remain heavily con centrated  in dollar-b ased assets, and  both a stro ng \ndollar and  a low-i nflatio n environ ment are very m uch in our in terest.   \n \n If you wis h to keep abreas t of trade and curre ncy m atters, read The Financial Times.  This \nLondon-based pape r has l ong been t he leading source f or daily international financi al new s and n ow has an \nexcellen t American edition.  Both its reportin g and commentary on  trade are first-class. \n \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n And, again, our usual caveat : macro-ec onomics is a tough game in which few pe ople, Charlie and \nI included, have demonstrated skill.  W e may well turn out to be wrong in our currency judgm ents.  \n(Indee d, the fact that so m any pundits now predict weak ness fo r the dollar makes us uneasy.)  If so, our \nmistake will  be very  public.  The i rony is that if we chos e the opposite course, leavi ng all of Berk shire’s \nassets in  dollars ev en as th ey declin ed sign ificantly in val ue, no one woul d notice our m istake.  \n \n John May nard Keynes said in his m asterful The Ge neral Theory :  “Worldly wisdom  teaches that it \nis better for re putation t o fail c onventionally than to succeed unconve ntiona lly.” (Or, to put it in less elegant \nterms, lemmings as a cl ass may be deri ded but neve r does an individual lemmin g get criticized .)  Fro m a \nreputational standpoint, Ch arlie an d I run  a clear risk  with our foreign -exchange commitment.  Bu t we \nbelieve in managing Berkshire as i f we owned 100% of it ourselve s.  And, were  that the case, we would not  \nbe following  a dollar-on ly policy. \n \nMiscella neous \n \n• Last year I t old you about a group of University of Ten nessee fi nance s tudents who played a key \nrole in our $1.7 billion acquisition of Clayt on Homes.  Earlier, th ey had been brought to Omaha by \ntheir professor, Al Auxier – he brings a class eve ry year – to tour Nebraska Furniture Mart and \nBors heim ’s, eat at Gorat’s and ha ve a Q&A session with me at Ki ewit P laza.  These vi sitors, like  \nthose who come for our annual meeting, leave i mpressed by  both the city and i ts friendly \nresidents. \n \nOther colleges and universities h ave now co me calling.  This scho ol year we will h ave visiting \nclasses, ra nging in size from 30 to 100 students, from Chicago , Dartmouth (Tuck), Delaware State, \nFlori da State, India na, Iowa , Iowa State, Mary land, Nebras ka, Nort hwest Nazare ne, Pe nnsylva nia \n(Wharton), Stanford, Tennessee, Texas, Te xas A&M , Toronto (Rotman), Uni on and Utah.  M ost \nof the stud ents are MBA cand idates, an d I’ve been impressed  by their quality.  Th ey are keenly \ninterested in business a nd investments, but  their quest ions indicate that they also hav e more on  \ntheir minds t han simply making money .  I always feel good after meeting them. \n \n 21\n\nAt ou r sessi ons, I tell th e newcomers th e story of the Tenn essee group  and its spo tting of Clayton \nHomes.  I do  this in the spirit o f the farm er wh o enters his h en house with an ostrich egg and \nadmonishes the flo ck: “I do n’t lik e to complain, girls, bu t this is j ust a s mall sample of what the \ncompetitio n is doing.”  To  date, ou r new sco uts have not brought us deals.  Bu t their missio n in \nlife has been made clear to t hem. \n \n• You should be aware of an  acco unting rule that mild ly distorts our financial state ments in a pain-\ntoday , gain-tomorrow  manner.  B erkshire purchases l ife insurance  policies from individuals and \ncorporations who would otherwise surrender them for cas h.  As the new holder of the policies, we \npay any prem iums that beco me due and ul timately – wh en the ori ginal holder dies – collect the \nface value of the policies. \n \nThe orig inal po licyh older is u sually in  good health  when we pu rchase the p olicy.  Still, th e price \nwe p ay for it is always well ab ove its cash  surrend er value (“CSV”).  Sometimes th e original \npolicyho lder has bo rrowed  against the CSV to  make pr emium paym ents.  In that case, t he \nremaining CSV will b e tiny and our purchase p rice will b e a larg e multiple of what the orig inal \npolicyholde r woul d have  recei ved, had he  cashed out by surrende ring it. \n \nUnde r account ing rules, we must immediately char ge as a realized capi tal loss the excess over \nCSV th at we pay u pon purchasin g the policy.  W e also must make additional charges each  year fo r \nthe am ount by which the premium we pay  to keep the policy in force e xceeds t he increase in CSV.  \nBut obviously, w e don’t think these bookkeep ing charges r epresent econ omic losses.  I f we did, \nwe wouldn’t buy the policies. \n \nDuring 2004, we rec orded net “losses” fr om the purc hase of policies (and from the prem ium \npayments req uired to maintain them) totaling $207 million, wh ich was ch arged against realized  \ninvest ment gains in our earnings statement (included in “other”  in the table on page 17).  When \nthe procee ds from  these policies are receive d in th e future, we will record as realized inve stment \ngain t he excess over the t hen-CSV. \n \n• Two post-bubble gove rnance reforms have b een pa rticularly useful  at Berkshi re, an d I fa ult myself \nfor no t putting th em in place many years a go.  Th e first involves regu lar m eetings of directo rs \nwithout the C EO present.  I’ve sa t on 19 boards, and on many occasions this process  would have \nled to dub ious plans being examined more th oroughly.  In a few cases, CEO changes that were \nneede d would also have been  made more prom ptly.  There i s no do wnside to this process, an d \nthere a re many possible benefits. \n \nThe sec ond reform concer ns the “w histleblower line,” an a rrangem ent through which employees \ncan send  informatio n to me and the board’s audit committe e witho ut fear o f reprisal.  Berk shire’s \nextrem e decentralization m akes this system  partic ularly va luable both to me and the committee.   \n(In a spra wling “ci ty” of 18 0,000 – B erkshire’s cur rent employee cou nt – not every  spar row that \nfalls will be noticed at headqua rters.)  Most of the com plaints we have  received are of “the guy \nnext t o me has ba d breath” variety, but on occas ion I have learne d of important probl ems at our \nsubsidiaries that I ot herwise would have missed.  The issues rai sed are usually not of a t ype \ndiscoverable by au dit, bu t relate in stead to  personnel and business practices.  B erkshire would be \nmore valuable today if I had put in a wh istleblo wer lin e decades ago . \n \n• Charlie and I love the idea of shareholders thinking and behaving like owners.  Sometimes that \nrequires th em to be pro-active.  And in this aren a larg e institutional owners shou ld lead  the way. \n \nSo far, however, the moves made by  institutions have been less than awe-inspiring.  Usually, \nthey’ve focused on minutiae and igno red the three questio ns that tru ly count.  First, d oes the \ncompany have the right CEO?  Second, is he/she overreac hing in terms of com pensat ion?  Third, \nare proposed acquisition s more lik ely to  create o r destroy per-share value? \n \n 22\n\nOn such questions, the interests of t he CEO m ay wel l differ from thos e of the shareholders.  \nDirector s, moreover, sometimes lack  the knowledge or gumption to ov errule the CEO.  Th erefore, \nit’s v ital th at larg e own ers focus on these three questions a nd speak up when necessa ry. \n \nInstea d many sim ply follow a “chec klist” ap proach to the issu e du jour.  Last year I was on the \nreceiving end of a judgm ent reache d in that  manner.  Se veral institutional share holders and their \nadvis ors deci ded I lac ked “inde pendence” in my role as  a director of Coca-C ola.  One group \nwant ed me rem oved fr om the b oard and anot her si mply want ed m e booted from the au dit \ncommittee. \n \nMy first impulse was  to secre tly fund the group behind the seco nd idea.  Why  anyone would wish \nto be on an audit committee is beyond  me.  But since directors must be assig ned to one commit tee \nor an other, and since no C EO want s me on hi s com pensat ion committee, it’s often bee n my lot to \nget an audit committee assig nment.  As it turned out, the institutions that opposed me failed and I \nwas re-elected to the aud it job.  (I fought off the urg e to ask for a recount.) \n \nSome institutions questione d my “indepe ndence” b ecause, among ot her things, McLa ne and Dai ry \nQueen buy lots of Coke products.  ( Do they want us to favor Pepsi?)  Bu t independence is defined \nin Webst er’s as “not subject  to control by others.”   I’m puzzled how anyone could conclude that \nour Coke purchases w ould “control” my deci sion-m aking when the counterweight is the wel l-\nbeing of $8 billion o f Coke stock held by Berkshire.  Assuming I’m even m arginally rational, \nelementary arithm etic should make  it clear that my heart  and m ind belong to the owners of Coke, \nnot to its managem ent. \n \nI can ’t resist mentioning that Jesus understood the cal ibration of independence far m ore clearly \nthan do the pro testin g institutio ns.  In Matt hew 6:21 He observed: “For wh ere y our treasure is, \nthere will yo ur heart b e also .”  Ev en to an institutional investor, $8 billion should qualify as  \n“treasure” that dwarfs any profits  Berkshire might earn on its routine transactions with Coke. \n \nMeasure d by the biblical sta ndard, the Berkshi re board is  a model: (a ) every director is  a member \nof a fam ily owning at least $4 million o f stock; (b) none of these s hares were ac quire d from \nBerk shire via options or gran ts; (c) no directors receive c ommit tee, co nsulting or board fees from \nthe com pany that are m ore than a tiny portion of th eir annu al income; and (d) alth ough we hav e a \nstandard corp orate ind emnity arran gement, we carry no liability in surance for directors. \n \nAt Berks hire, board m embers travel  the same road as s hareholders. \n \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n \nCharlie and I have see n much be havior confirming the Bible’s “t reasure” point.  In our view, \nbased on our considerable boardroom expe rience, t he least indepe ndent directors  are likely to be  \nthose who receive an im portant fra ction of their annual incom e from  the fees  they receive for \nboard service (and who hope as wel l to be recom mended for election to other boards and thereby \nto boost th eir income further).  Yet th ese are the very board m embers most ofte n classed as  \n“independent.” \n \nMost directors of this type are  decent pe ople and do a first-c lass job.  But they wouldn’t be hum an \nif they weren’t te mpted to thwart action s that wo uld threaten their livelihood.  Some may go on to \nsuccumb to such  temptations. \n \nLet’s look at an example bas ed upon circumstantial evidence.  I have first-hand knowledge of a \nrecent acquisition proposal (not from  Berkshire) t hat was favored by managem ent, blessed by the  \ncompany’s investment banke r and sl ated to go f orward at a price above  the lev el at which the \nstock had sold for som e years ( or now sells for).  In addition, a number of directors favored the \ntransact ion and wanted it proposed to shareholders. \n \n 23\n\nSeve ral of t heir brethren, howeve r, each of whom received board and committee fees totaling \nabout $10 0,000  annu ally, scu ttled the propo sal, wh ich meant that sh areholders never learn ed of \nthis multi-billion offer.  Non-m anagement directors owned little sto ck except for sh ares th ey had \nreceive d from  the com pany.  Their open-market purcha ses in rece nt years ha d meanwhile been \nnominal, eve n though the stock had sold far below the acquisition price proposed.  In other words, \nthese di rectors didn’t want  the sha reholders to be offe red X eve n though they had consi stently \ndeclin ed th e opp ortun ity to  buy sto ck for thei r own acc ount at a fracti on of X. \n \nI don’t know which directors opposed l etting shareholders see t he offe r.  But I do k now that \n$100,000 is an important portion of the annual income of som e of those deem ed “i ndependent,” \nclearly meetin g the Matth ew 6:21 definition of “t reasure.”   If the deal ha d gone t hrough, these fees  \nwould have ended. \n \nNeith er th e shareho lders nor I will ev er kn ow what motivated the dissenters.  Indeed they \nthemselves will n ot likely kno w, given that sel f-interest i nevitably blurs in trospection.  We do \nknow one thing, though: At the sam e meeting at whic h the deal was reje cted, the board voted itself \na significant i ncrease in di rectors ’ fees. \n \n• While we are on the sub ject of self-i nterest, let’s tu rn again  to the m ost important acco unting \nmech anism still av ailab le to CEOs who wish to overstate earni ngs: the non-expensing of stock \noptions .  The accom plices in perpetuating t his ab surdity have been m any members of Congre ss \nwho have defied the arguments put forth by all Big Fo ur auditors, all members o f the Financial \nAcco unting Standa rds Board and virtually all invest ment professi onals. \n \nI’m enclosing an op-e d piece I wrote for The Was hington Post  desc ribing a truly breathtaking bill \nthat was passe d 312-111 by the House last sum mer.  Than ks to Senator Richard Shelby, the Senat e \ndidn’t ratify th e Ho use’s foo lishn ess.  And , to his great cred it, Bill Do naldson, th e investor-\nminded Chairman  of the SEC, h as stood firm against massive political p ressure, generated  by the \ncheck -waving CEOs who first muscled Congress in 1993 about the issue of option acc ounting and \nthen repeated t he tactic last year. \n \nBecause t he attempts to obfuscate the st ock-optio n issue continue, it’s worth poi nting out that no \none – nei ther the FA SB, nor invest ors ge nerally, nor I – are t alking about restricting the use o f \noptions i n any way.  Indee d, my successor at Berks hire may well receive m uch of his pay via  \noptions, albeit logically-stru ctured ones in resp ect to  1) an appropriate strike price, 2) a n escalation \nin price that reflects the retention of earnings, and 3) a ba n on his quickly disposing of any shares \npurchased t hrough options.  We chee r arra ngem ents that motivate managers , whether these be  \ncash bonuses or options.  And if a co mpany is tru ly receiv ing value for the options it issu es, we \nsee no  reason why recording their cost should cut dow n on their use. \n \nThe sim ple fact is th at certain CEOs know their own compensation  would be far more ratio nally \ndetermined if options were exp ensed.  Th ey also suspect that their stock w ould sell at a l ower price \nif realistic acc ounting were em ployed, meaning that they wou ld reap less in  the market when they \nunloade d their personal holdings.  To these CEOs such unpleasant  prospects are a  fate to be fought \nwith all th e reso urces th ey have at hand – even thou gh the funds they use in t hat fight norm ally \ndon’t belong to them, but are instead pu t up by th eir sharehold ers. \n \n Option-expensing is scheduled to become mandatory on June 15th.  You ca n the refore expect \nintensified effo rts to  stall o r emasculate th is rule between n ow and  then.  Let yo ur Con gressm an \nand Sen ators know what you  think on this issu e. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 24\n\nThe Annual Meeting  \n \n There  are two cha nges this year concerning the annual meeting.  Fi rst, we have sc heduled the \nmeetin g for the last Satu rday in  April (the 30th), rath er th an the usual first Saturd ay in May.  Th is year \nMother’s Day falls on May 8, and it would be unfair to ask the employees o f Borsheim’s and Gorat’s to \ntake care of us at that special time – so we’ve m oved everything up a we ek.  Ne xt year we’ll return  to our \nregular tim ing, holding the meetin g on May 6, 2006. \n \n Additionally, we are c hanging the sequence of e vents on meeting day , April 30.  Just as al ways, \nthe doors will o pen at th e Qwest Cen ter at 7 a.m. and the movie will b e shown at 8:30.  At 9:30, however, \nwe will g o directly to the question and answer p eriod, which (allo wing  for lunch at th e Qwest’s stan ds) will  \nlast u ntil 3:00.  Then, after a sh ort recess, C harlie and  I will convene the ann ual meetin g at 3:15. \n \n We ha ve m ade this chan ge be cause a n umber of s hareholders com plained last year about  the time \nconsumed by  two speakers who advocat ed proposal s of limited interest to the majority of the audience – \nand who  were no doubt relishing their chance to talk  to a cap tive group of about 19,500.  With our n ew \nprocedure, those sha reholders who wish to hear it all can stick around for the formal meeting and those who \ndon’t can leav e – or better yet shop. \n \n There w ill be plenty of opportun ity fo r that pastime in the vast ex hibition hall that adj oins the \nmeeting area.  Kelly Muchem ore, the Fl o Zi egfel d of B erkshire, put  on a magnificent shopping \nextra vaganza last year, and s he says that was just a wa rm-up for this y ear.  (Kelly , I am delighted to report, \nis getting m arried in October.  I’m  giving her away  and s uggested that she make a li ttle history by holding \nthe we dding at the annual m eeting.  She balked, however, wh en Charlie insisted that he be  the ringbea rer.) \n \n Again we will showcase a 2,1 00 square foot Cl ayton home (featu ring Ac me brick, Shaw carpet, \nJohns Manville insulation, MiTek fast eners, Carefree a wnings a nd NFM furniture).  Take a t our through \nthe home.  Better yet, buy it. \n \n GEIC O will h ave a boo th staffed  by a nu mber of its to p counselors from around the coun try, all of \nthem read y to supply you  with auto insuran ce quotes.  In m ost cases, GEICO will b e able to give yo u a \nspecial shareholder discount (us ually 8%).  This sp ecial offer is perm itted by 45 of the 50 jurisdictions in \nwhich we o perate.  B ring the details of y our existing insurance a nd check out whet her we can sa ve you \nmoney . \n \n On Saturd ay, at the Omaha airpo rt, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets® \navailab le for your insp ection .  Stop  by the NetJets boo th at the Qwest t o learn a bout view ing these planes.  \nCome to Omaha by bus; leav e in your  new plane. \n \n The B ookworm shop did a terrific business last year sel ling B erkshire-related books.  Di splaying \n18 titles, th ey so ld 2,920 copies fo r $61,000.  Sin ce we ch arge the shop no rent (I m ust be getting soft), it \ngives shareho lders a 20 % discount.  Th is year I’ve asked  The Boo kworm to add Grah am Alliso n’s Nuclear  \nTerrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe , a m ust-rea d for those concer ned with the safet y of our \ncountry.  In  addition, the shop  will p remiere Poor C harlie’s Almanack,  a book compiled by Peter Kaufman.  \nScholars ha ve fo r too long debated whether Charlie is the rein carnation of Ben  Frank lin.  This book shou ld \nsettle th e question. \n \n An attachm ent to t he proxy  material that is encl osed w ith th is report explains how you  can obtain \nthe cred ential yo u will n eed for ad mission to the meeting and other events.  As fo r plane, ho tel and car \nreser vations, we have a gain signed up American Ex press (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  The y do \na terrific job for us eac h year, and I tha nk the m for it. \n \n At Ne braska  Furniture  Mart, located on a 77-ac re site on 72nd Street between Dodge  and Pacific, \nwe will again be having “Berk shire Week end” pricing .  We in itiated  this special ev ent at NFM ei ght years \nago, and sal es during the “Weeke nd” grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $25.1 million in 2004 (up 45% \n 25\n\nfrom  a year earlier).  Every year has set a new record, and on Saturday of last year, we had t he largest  \nsingle-day sales in NFM ’s history – $6 .1 million. \n \n To get the discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, April 28 and Monday, \nMay 2  inclusive, an d also  present your m eeting cred ential.  Th e period’s sp ecial p ricing  will ev en apply to \nthe products of several  prestigious m anufact urers that normally have i ronclad rules aga inst discounting but \nthat, in the spirit of our shareholder week end, have  made an exce ption for y ou.  We a ppreciate their \ncooperation.  NFM  is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m . Monday through S aturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p. m. on \nSunday .  On Saturday this year, f rom 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. we are having a special affair for s hareholders  \nonly.  I’ll be there, eat ing barbeque and drinking Coke. \n \n Borsheim’s – the larg est jewelry sto re in the country ex cept for Tiffan y’s Manh attan  store – will \nhave t wo sha reholder-only events.  The first  will be a cocktail reception from  6 p.m . to 10 p.m. on Fri day, \nApril 2 9.  The seco nd, the main  gala, will b e from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday, May 1 .  On Saturday, we \nwill b e open until 6 p.m.   \n \n We w ill have h uge crow ds at Bo rsheim’s th roughout the weekend.  Fo r your con venience, \ntherefore, sh areholder prices will b e available fro m Monday, April 25  throug h Saturday, May 7 .  During \nthat period, just identify yoursel f as a s hareholder through your m eeting c redentials or a brokerage \nstatement.   \n \n Borsheim’s operates on a gross m argin th at is fu lly twenty p ercentage points below t hat of its \nmajor rivals, even before the share holders’ discount.  Last year, busines s over the weekend inc reased 73% \nfrom 2003, settin g a reco rd that will b e tough to beat.  Show m e it can  be done. \n \n In a ten t outside of Borsheim’s, Patrick  Wolff, twice U.S. ch ess ch ampion, will tak e on all co mers \nin groups of six – blindfolded.  Add itionally, we will h ave Bob  Hamm an and Sh aron Osberg, two of th e \nworld’s top bridge e xperts, available to play with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon.  They  plan to keep \ntheir eyes open – but Bob never sorts his cards, eve n when playing for a national champions hip. \n \n Gorat’s – my fav orite steak house – will again  be open exclu sively for Berk shire sh areholders on \nSunday, May 1, and  will b e serv ing from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  Please re member that to come to Gorat’s o n \nthat day, you  must have a reservation .  To make one, call 40 2-551-3733 on  April 1 ( but not before).  If \nSunday is so ld out, try Gorat’s o n one of th e other evenings yo u will b e in town.  Enh ance you r reputation \nas an  epicure by ordering, as I do, a rare T-bone with a double helping of hash browns. \n \n We will again have a special r eception from 4:00 to 5: 30 on Saturd ay afternoon for sha reholde rs \nwho have come from outside of North America.  E very year our meeting dra ws many people from around \nthe globe, and Charlie and I want  to be sure we pe rsonally greet  those who have come so fa r.  Last  year we \nenjoyed m eeting more than 400 of you including at least 100 from Australia.  Any shareholder who comes \nfrom other than the U.S. or Canada will be g iven a special cred ential an d instructions for atten ding this \nfunction. \n \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n \n Charlie and  I are lu cky.  We have jobs th at we love an d are hel ped every day in a myriad of ways \nby talen ted and cheerfu l associates.  No  won der we tap-d ance to  work.  But nothing is more fun  for us th an \ngetting together with our shareholder-partners at Berkshire’s annual meeting.  So join us on April 30th at the  \nQwest for our annual W oodstock for Capitalists. \n \n \nFebruary 28, 2005    Warren E. Buff ett \n      Chairm an of the Board \n \n 26",

In this table, Berkshire’s results \nthrough 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rule s.  In all other respects, the results are calculated using \nthe numbers originally reported. \nThe S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax  whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax .  If a corporation such as Berkshire \nwere simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appr opriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500 \nin years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index \nshowed a negative return.  Over the years, the tax cost s would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.  \n\n \nBER KSHIR E HATHAWAY  INC. \n \n \nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hath away Inc. : \n \n Our gain in net worth du ring 2005 was $5.6 billion, which increased  the per-share book  value of \nboth our Class A an d Class B stock by 6.4%.  Over the last 41 y ears (that is, since present  managem ent \ntook over) book value has grown from  $19 t o $59,377, a rate of 21.5% c ompounded annually.* \n \n Berkshire ha d a decent year in 2005.  We initiated five acquisitions (two of whic h have yet to  \nclose) an d most of ou r operating su bsidiaries pros pered.  Even o ur insurance b usiness in its entirety did \nwell, th ough Hurrican e Kat rina in flicted  record  losses on both Berk shire an d the indu stry.  We estim ate our \nloss fro m Katrin a at $2.5 billion – and  her ugly sisters, Rit a and Wilma, co st us an additional $.9 billion.  \n \n Cred it GEICO – and its brillian t CEO, To ny Nicely –  for our stellar in surance resu lts in a d isaster-\nridden year.  One statistic stan ds out: In  just two  years, GEICO im proved its p roductivity b y 32%.  \nRemarkabl y, employment fell by 4% eve n as pol icy count grew by 26% – an d more gai ns are i n store.  \nWhen we dri ve un it co sts d own in such a dram atic manner, we can offer ever-greater value to our \ncustomers.  The payoff: Last year, GEICO gained market-share, earned commenda ble profits and \nstrengthened its brand.  If you have a new son or grandson in 2006, name him Tony . \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n My g oal in writin g this report is to  give you the info rmatio n you need to estimate Berk shire’s \nintrinsic value .  I say  “estimate” becaus e calculations  of intrinsic value, t hough all-im porta nt, are  \nnecessa rily impreci se and often seriously wrong.  The  more unce rtain the future of a business, the more \npossibility th ere is th at the calculation will b e wild ly off-base.  (Fo r an explanation  of intrinsic v alue, see \npage s 77 – 78.)  Here B erkshire has s ome adva ntages: a wide vari ety of relatively-stable earni ngs streams, \ncombined with great  liquidity and minimum debt.  These factors m ean that Berks hire’s in trinsic v alue can  \nbe m ore precis ely calculated than can th e intrinsic value of m ost companies. \n \n Yet if preci sion is aided by Berkshire’s financial ch aracteristics, th e job o f calcu lating in trinsic \nvalue has bee n made more com plex by the mere prese nce of s o many earni ngs st reams.  Back i n 1965, \nwhen we own ed only a sm all textile o peration , the task  of calcu lating intrinsic v alue was a sn ap.  No w we \nown 68 distinct businesses  with widely disparat e operating and financial charact eristics.  T his array of \nunrelated enterprises, coupled with our massive invest ment holdings, makes i t impossi ble for you to simply \nexamine our consolidated financial state ments and arriv e at an  informed estimate of intrinsic value. \n \n We h ave at tempted to ease t his problem by clustering our businesses into four logical groups, each \nof which we discu ss later in  this repo rt.  In th ese d iscussions, we will p rovide the key figures for bo th the \ngroup and its important com ponents.  Of course, the value of B erkshire may be ei ther great er or less than \nthe sum  of these fo ur parts.  The o utcome depen ds on whether o ur many units function better or worse by \nbeing part of a larger e nterprise and whether capi tal allocation improves or deteriorates wh en it is un der the \ndirection of a holding company.  In other words, does Berkshire ownership bring anything to the party, or \nwould our s harehol ders be better off if they directly owne d sha res in each  of our 68 busi nesses ?  These are \nimportant questio ns but ones that you  will h ave to answer for you rself. \n \n Before we look at our individual businesses, however, let’s review two sets of figures that show \nwhere we ’ve c ome from  and whe re we are now.  The fi rst set is the am ount of invest ments (including cash \nand cash-equivalents) we o wn on a per-share basi s.  In making this calculation, we excl ude investments \nheld in our fina nce ope ration because these are largely offs et by borrowi ngs: \n  \n * All fi gures used in t his report ap ply to Berkshi re’s A shares, the successor to the  only stock that  \nthe company had  outstan ding before 1996.

In the table above, however, the base year of 1965 was abnormally good; \nBerk shire earned  more money in that year th an it d id in all bu t one of the previous ten. \n \n As you can see f rom the two tab les, the com parative growth rates of Berkshire’s two elements of \nvalue have change d in the last decade, a  result re flecting our e ver-increasi ng em phasis on business  \nacquisition s.  Nev ertheless, Ch arlie Mu nger, Berk shire’s Vice Ch airman and my p artner, and  I wan t to \nincrease t he figures i n both tables.  In this ambition, we hope – metaphori cally – to avoid the fate of the \nelderly couple who had been  rom antically challenged for some time.  As they finished dinner on their 50th \nanniversa ry, however, the wife – st imulated by  soft music, wi ne and candlelight – felt a long-absent tickle \nand demurely suggested to her husband that they go u pstairs and m ake love.  He ag onized f or a m oment \nand then replied, “I can do one or the other, but not both.” \n \nAcquisiti ons \n \n Over the years, our current businesses, in aggregate, should del iver modest growth in operating \nearnings.  Bu t they will n ot in themselves produce tru ly satisfacto ry gains.  We will n eed major acq uisitions \nto get that job done. \n \n In this quest, 2005 was encouraging.  We agreed  to five purch ases: two  that were co mpleted  last \nyear, one that closed after ye arend a nd two others that we expect  to cl ose soon.  None of the deals invo lve \nthe issuance of Berkshi re sha res.  That ’s a c rucial, but often ignored, point: Whe n a managem ent proudly \nacqui res a nother company for stock, the shareholders of the acquirer are concurrently selling part of their \ninterest in  everyth ing they own.  I’ve made this kind of deal a few times myse lf – and, on balance, my \nactions have cost you money . \n \n 4\n\n Here  are last y ear’s  purchases :  \n \n• On June 3 0 we bo ught Medical Protective Com pany (“MedPro”), a 106-year- old medical \nmalp ractice insurer b ased in Fort Wayne.  Malp ractice insura nce is tough to underwri te and has \nproved to be a graveyard  for many insurers.  Med Pro nevertheless shou ld do well.  It will h ave the \nattitu dinal advantage that all Berk shire in surers share, wherein  underwri ting discipline trumps all \nother goals.  Additionally, as part of Berk shire, MedPro has financial streng th far ex ceeding that of \nits co mpetitors, a quality assu ring doctors t hat lon g-to-set tle clai ms will not end up back on their \ndoorstep because their ins urer failed.  Fi nally, the com pany has a sm art and e nergetic CEO, Tim \nKenesey, who instinctively thin ks like a Berk shire manager. \n \n• Forest Riv er, our seco nd acquisition , closed on Augu st 31.  A co uple of months earlier, on  June \n21, I recei ved a two-pa ge fa x telling me – point by point – why Forest River m et the ac quisition \ncriteria we set  fort h on page 25 o f this report.  I ha d not  before he ard of the co mpany, a \nrecreation al vehicle manufacturer with  $1.6 billion of sales, nor of Pete Lieg l, its owner and \nmanager .  But the fax made sense, a nd I immediately asked for m ore figures.  T hese ca me the next  \nmorning, and that afternoon I made Pet e an offer.  On June 28, we shook hands on a deal. \n \nPete is a remarkable en trepreneur.  So me years back, he sold his business, then far smaller than \ntoday, to a n LBO operat or who prom ptly bega n telling him how to run th e place.  Before long, \nPete left, and the business soon sunk into bankruptcy.  Pete then repurchased i t.  You can be sure \nthat I won’t be telling Pet e how to manage hi s operation. \n \nForest River has 60 plants, 5,400 em ployees and has c onsistently gained share in the RV business, \nwhile also e xpandi ng into other areas s uch as boats .  Pete is 61 – and definitely in an acceleration \nmode.  Read the piece from  RV Business  that accom panies this report , and you’ll see why Pete and \nBerks hire are made for ea ch other. \n \n• On November 12, 2005, an article ran  in The Wall Street Journal deal ing with Berkshire’s unusual \nacquisition  and managerial practices.  In  it Pete d eclared, “It was easier to  sell my b usiness th an to \nrenew my driver’s license.” \n \nIn New Yo rk, Cath y Baro n Tamraz read  the article, and it struc k a chord.  On Novem ber 21, she \nsent m e a letter that  began, “As  president  of Business Wire, I’d lik e to introduce you to my \ncompany, as I believe it fits th e profile o f Berkshire Hath away sub sidiary companies as d etailed  in \na recen t Wall Street Jou rnal article.” \n \nBy th e time I finished Cathy’s two-p age letter, I felt Busi ness Wire  and Berk shire  were a fit.  I \nparticula rly lik ed her penultimate paragra ph: “We run a tight shi p and keep  unnecessary spendi ng \nunder wraps.  No secret aries or m anagem ent layers he re.  Yet  we’ll invest big dollars to gain a \ntechnological a dvantage  and move the busi ness forward.” \n \nI prom ptly gave Cathy a call, and before l ong Berks hire had reache d agreem ent with Busi ness \nWire’s controlling shareholder, Lorry Lokey, who founded the com pany in 1961 (and who had \njust made Cathy CEO).  I love success st ories like Lorry’s.  Today  78, he  has built a com pany t hat \ndissem inates inf ormation in 150 co untries for 25,000 clients.  Hi s story, like those of m any \nentrepreneurs who have sel ected B erkshire as a hom e for their life’s work, is  an exam ple of what  \ncan happe n when a good i dea, a talented  individual and hard work converge. \n \n• In Decem ber we agreed to buy 81% of Applied Underwriters, a  com pany that offe rs a combination \nof pay roll services a nd workers’ compensation insurance to small businesses.   A majority of \nApplied’s c ustomers are located in Californ ia. \n \n \n \n 5\n\nIn 1998, though, when the company had 12 em ployees, it acqui red a n Om aha-base d operation \nwith 24 em ployees that offe red a som ewhat-similar service.  Sid Ferenc and St eve Menzies, wh o \nhave built App lied’s remarkable bu siness, co ncluded that O maha had many advantages as an \noperation al base – a brillia nt insight, I might add  – and tod ay 400  of the co mpany’s 479 \nemployees are located here . \n \nLess than a year ago, Appl ied entere d into a large rein suran ce con tract with  Ajit Jain , the \nextraordinary manager of Natio nal Ind emnity’s re insuran ce division.  Ajit was im pressed  by Sid \nand Steve, a nd they liked Berk shire’s method of operation.  So  we decide d to join forces .  We are \npleased that Si d and Steve  retain 19% of Applied.  They started on a s hoestring only 12  years ago , \nand it will b e fun to see what they can  accom plish with Berk shire’s backing. \n \n• Last spri ng, MidAm erican Ener gy, our 80.5% owned subsidiary, agreed t o buy PacifiCorp, a \nmajor electric u tility serv ing six Western states.  An acquisition  of this so rt requires m any \nregulatory approvals, bu t we’ve now obtained these and expect to close this tran sactio n soon . \nBerk shire will then buy $3.4 billion of MidAm erican ’s commo n stock, which MidAmerican  will \nsupplement with  $1.7 billion of borro wing to complete th e purchase.  You can’t ex pect to earn \noutsized  profits in  regulated utilities, b ut the in dustry offers own ers the opportun ity to  deploy large \nsums at fai r returns – an d therefore, it makes go od se nse for Berks hire.  A few years back, I said \nthat we hoped to make some very larg e purchases in the utility field .  No te the plural – we’ll b e \nlooking for more. \n \n In addition to buying these new op eration s, we co ntinue to make “bolt-on” acquisition s.  So me \naren’t so sm all: Sh aw, our  carpet operation , spent abou t $550 million last year  on two pu rchases that \nfurth ered its vertical in tegration and shou ld improve its profit m argin in th e future.  XTRA and  Clayto n \nHom es also m ade value-enhancing acquisitions. \n \n Unlike many business buyers, Berkshire has no “exi t strategy.”  We buy to keep .  We do, though, \nhave an entrance strateg y, look ing for businesses in  this coun try or abroad that meet our s ix criteria and are \navailab le at a p rice th at will p roduce a reaso nable return.  If you  have a business that fits, g ive me a call.   \nLike a hopeful teenage girl, I’ll b e waitin g by the phone. \n \nInsur ance \n \n Let’s now  talk abo ut our four sector s and  start with insuran ce, our core business.  What coun ts \nhere is the am ount of “fl oat” and its cost over tim e. \n \n For new rea ders, let m e explain.  “Floa t” is money that do esn’t belo ng to us but that we \ntemporarily hold.  Most of our fl oat arises because (1) pre miums are pa id upfront though  the servic e we  \nprovide – insurance protection – i s delivered over a pe riod that usual ly cove rs a y ear and; (2) loss events \nthat occur toda y do not always resu lt in our immediately p aying claim s, because it sometim es takes many \nyears for lo sses to  be repo rted (asb estos lo sses wou ld be an example), negotiated  and settled .  Th e $20 \nmillion of flo at that ca me with our 1967 entry in to insurance has n ow increased – both by way  of internal \ngrowth and acquisition s – to $49 billion. \n \n Float is wonderful – if it doesn’t come at a high price.  Its co st is d etermined by underwritin g \nresults, m eaning how th e expen ses an d losses we will ultimatel y pay com pare with  the premiums we h ave \nreceive d.  Whe n an insurer earns a n unde rwriting profit – as has been t he case at Be rkshire in a bout hal f of \nthe 39 y ears we ha ve bee n in the insurance b usiness – float is b etter th an free.  In su ch years, we are  \nactually paid for holding other people’s money .  Fo r most insure rs, howeve r, life  has bee n far more \ndiffic ult: In aggre gate, the prope rty-casualty indust ry alm ost inva riably operates at an underwriting l oss.  \nWhen that loss is larg e, float becomes exp ensive, sometimes devastatin gly so. \n \n \n \n 6\n\n In 2004 our float cost  us less than nothing, and I told you that we had a chance  – absent a mega-\ncatastrophe – of no-cost float in 200 5.  B ut we had the mega-cat, and as a specialis t in that coverage, \nBerk shire suffered  hurrican e losses o f $3.4 billion.  Nev ertheless, o ur float was costless in 2005 because of \nthe superb results we had in our other insurance activ ities, particularly at GEIC O. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Auto policies in force gre w by 12.1% at GE ICO, a gain i ncreasing its m arket s hare of U.S. private \npasse nger aut o busi ness f rom about 5.6% t o about 6.1%.  Aut o insurance is a bi g business:  Each s hare-\npoint equates to $1.6 billion in sales. \n \n While ou r brand streng th is not quantifiab le, I b elieve it also  grew sign ifican tly.  W hen Berk shire \nacqui red c ontrol of GEICO in 1996, its annual advertising expenditures were $31 m illion.  Last  year we \nwere up  to $502 million.  And I can ’t wait to spend more. \n \n Our adve rtising works because we ha ve a great  story to tell: More pe ople can sa ve money by \ninsuring  with  us than is th e case with  any other national carrier offering  policies to  all co mers.  (So me \nspecialized aut o insure rs do partic ularly well for a pplicants fitting i nto their niches; also, because our  \nnational competitors use rati ng system s that differ from ours, they will so metimes b eat o ur price.)  Last \nyear, we ac hieved by far the highest conversion rate – the perce ntage of internet and phone quotes turned \ninto sales – in ou r history.  This is po werfu l evidence that our prices a re more attract ive relativ e to the \ncompetitio n than ever before.  Test us by going to GEIC O.co m or by callin g 800-847-7536.  Be su re to \nindicate you  are a sh areholder because that fact will o ften qualify you  for a discount. \n \n I told you last year abo ut GEICO’s en try into  New Jersey in  August, 2004.  Drivers in that state \nlove us.  Our retention rate there for new policyholders is running higher than in any other state, an d by \nsometime in  2007, GEIC O is likely to  become the third largest au to insu rer in New Jersey.  There, as \nelsewh ere, our low co sts allow low prices that lead  to steady g ains in profitab le business. \n \n That simple form ula im mediately impressed m e 55 y ears ago when I first discovered GEIC O.  \nIndeed, at age 21, I wrote an article about the company – it’s reproduced on page 24 – when its market \nvalue was $ 7 million.  As y ou can see , I cal led GE ICO “T he Sec urity I Like B est.”  An d that’s what I still \ncall it.  \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n We ha ve m ajor reins urance operatio ns at G eneral Re and National Indemnity.  The fo rmer is run \nby Joe Brandon and Tad Montross, the latter by Ajit Jain.  Bo th un its performed well in  2005 considering \nthe extraordinary hu rrican e losses th at battered  the ind ustry. \n \n It’s a n open question whet her atm ospheric, ocea nic or other causal factors ha ve dra matically \nchange d the freque ncy or int ensity of hurri canes.  R ecent expe rience is worris ome.  We know, for ins tance, \nthat in  the 100  year s before 2004, abou t 59 hurricanes of Catego ry 3 strength, or  greater , hit th e \nSoutheastern a nd Gulf Coast states, and that  only three of these we re Catego ry 5s.  We f urther k now that in \n2004 there were three C ategory 3 storms that ham mered those areas  and that these were foll owed by four \nmore in 2005, one of them, Katrina, the most destructive hurricane in industry history.  Mor eover, there \nwere th ree Categ ory 5s near th e coast last ye ar that fortunat ely weak ened before landfall. \n \n Was t his on slaught of more frequ ent and  more in tense sto rms merely an anomaly?  Or was it \ncause d by changes in climate, wat er temperature or other variables we don’t fully understand?  And could \nthese fact ors be d eveloping in a manner that will soo n prod uce disasters dwarfing Katrina?  \n \n Joe, Ajit and I don’t know the an swer t o these all-i mportant questio ns.  What  we do k now is that \nour ign orance means we must fo llow th e course prescrib ed by Pascal in  his fam ous wag er abou t the \nexistence o f God.  As y ou may recal l, he concl uded that since he di dn’t know the answer, his per sonal \ngain/loss ratio dictated  an affirmative conclusion. \n \n \n 7\n\n So guided, we’ve concluded that we s hould now write mega-cat  policies onl y at prices f ar higher \nthan prev ailed  last year –  and then only with  an aggregate expos ure that woul d not cau se us distres s if shifts  \nin some important variable produ ce far m ore co stly sto rms in  the near future.  To  a lesser d egree, we felt \nthis way  after 2004 – and cut back our writings when prices didn’t move.  No w our caution has i ntensified.  \nIf prices seem  appropriate, howev er, we contin ue to have both the ability an d the app etite to  be the larges t \nwriter of mega-cat  coverage in the world. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Our sm aller in surers, with MedPro added to the fold, delivered  truly outstan ding results last year.  \nHowe ver, what you see in the  table be low does not do full jus tice to their perform ance.  That’s because  we \nincreased  the l oss reserv es of MedPro by about $125 million immed iately after our purchase. \n \n No one knows with any precisio n what amo unt will be required to  pay the claim s we in herited.  \nMedical malpractice insura nce is a “l ong-tai l” line, meaning that claim s often take m any years to settle.  In  \naddition, there are o ther losses th at have occurred, but that we won ’t even hear abou t for some time.  On e \nthing, though, we h ave learn ed – the hard way –  after m any years in  the business: Su rprises in  insuran ce are \nfar from symmetr ical.  Y ou ar e lucky if yo u get one that is pleasan t for ev ery ten th at go the other way.  \nToo often, howeve r, insurers react to  loom ing loss  proble ms with optim ism.  They be have like  the fellow in \na swi tchblade fight who, after his opponent has t aken a  mighty swipe at his throat, excl aimed, “Y ou never \ntouched me.”  H is adversary ’s rep ly: “Ju st wait until yo u try to  shake your head.” \n \n Excluding the reser ves we a dded for prior periods, MedPro wrote at an underwriting profit.  And \nour other primary com panies, in aggregate, had a n underwriting profit of $324 million on $1,270 m illion of \nvolume.  Th is is an  extraordinary result, and ou r thanks go  to Rod Eldred of Berk shire Hathaway  \nHomestate Co mpanies, Joh n Kizer of Cen tral States In demnity, To m Nern ey of U. S.

The larg est of these are (1 ) Yorkshire Electricity  and Northern Electric, wh ose \n3.7 million electric cu stomers m ake it t he third larg est d istribu tor of electricity in  the U.K.; (2) \nMidAm erican Energy, whic h serves 706,000 electric customers,  primarily in Iowa; an d (3) Kern  River and \nNorthern Natural pipelines, w hich car ry 7.8% of the natural gas co nsum ed in the U.S.  Whe n our Paci fiCorp \nacquisition  closes, we will ad d 1.6 million electric cu stomers in six Western  states, with Orego n and Utah \nproviding us the most business.  Th is tran sactio n will increase Mid American ’s rev enues by $3.3 billion and  \nits assets b y $14.1 billion. \n \n \n \n \n \n 8\n\n The Pub lic Utili ty Ho lding Co mpany Act (“PUHC A”) was rep ealed o n Aug ust 8, 2 005, a \nmilesto ne that allo wed Berk shire to  convert its Mid American p referred stock i nto voting com mon share s on \nFebruary 9, 2 006.  Thi s conversion ended a con voluted corporate arrangem ent that PUHC A ha d forced  \nupon us.  No w we have 83.4% of b oth the com mon st ock and t he votes at MidAm erican, w hich allows us \nto cons olidate the com pany’s inc ome for fina ncial accounting a nd tax purposes .  Our true ec onom ic \ninterest, howe ver, is the aforem entioned 80.5%, since t here are options outstanding that are sure t o be \nexercised  within a few years an d that upon exercise will d ilute our ownership. \n \n Though our voting pow er has in creased  dramatically, the dynamics of our four-party ownership \nhave  not changed at all.  We view M idAm erican as a  partnership am ong Berkshire, Walter Scott, and two \nterrific m anagers, Dave Sokol and Greg Abel.  It’s unimportant how many votes each party has; we  will \nmake major m oves only whe n we a re unanimous i n thinking them wise.  Five years o f working with Dave , \nGreg and Walter have  underscored my original belief: Berkshire couldn’t have better partners. \n \n You will n otice th at this year  we h ave provided you with  two balance sheets, o ne representing our \nactual figures per GAAP on Decem ber 31, 2005 (which does not consolidate MidAm erican) a nd one  that \nreflects th e sub sequent conversion  of our preferred .  All fu ture fin ancial repo rts of Berk shire will in clude \nMidAm erican’s figures. \n \n Somewhat incongruously, Mid American owns the seco nd largest real estate b rokerage firm  in the \nU.S.  And it’s a gem .  The parent com pany’s nam e is HomeServices of  America, bu t our 19,200 agen ts \noperate through 18 locally-branded firms.  Aided by three small acqui sitions, we participated in $64 billion \nof transactions last year, u p 6.5% from 2004. \n \n Currently, th e white-ho t market in residential real estate of rece nt years i s cool ing down, and that \nshould lead  to ad ditional acqu isition possibilities fo r us.

He does not \nowe his brillian t reco rd to a rising tide: The manufactured-housing business has been disappo inting since \nBerks hire purc hased Clayton in 2003.  Indus try sales have  stagnate d at 40-year lows, a nd the recent uptick  \nfrom  Katrina-related dem and will alm ost certainly be  short-live d.  In rece nt years, m any industry  \nparticipants have suffered losses, and only Clayton ha s earned significant money . \n \n In this brutal e nvironm ent Clayton has bought a large am ount of manufac tured-housi ng loans from  \nmajor banks that found them unp rofitable and difficult to servi ce.  Clayton’s operating ex pertise and \nBerkshire’s financi al resources have m ade this an exce llent busi ness fo r us a nd one in whi ch we are \npreeminent.  We presen tly serv ice $17  billion of loans, com pared to $5.4 billon at th e time o f our purchase.  \nMoreover, Clayto n now own s $9.6 billion of its serv icing  portfolio, a position built up almost entirely sin ce \nBerk shire en tered  the picture. \n \n To finance th is portfolio, Clayto n borrows money fro m Berkshire, wh ich in turn borrows th e sam e \namount publicly.  For t he use of its credit, Berkshire charges Clayton a o ne percent age-point markup on its \nborrowing cos t.  In 2 005, the cost  to Clayton for this arrangem ent was $ 83 million.  That  amount is \nincluded in “Other” income in the table on t he faci ng page, and C layton’s earni ngs of $416 m illion are aft er \ndeducting  this payment. \n \n On the manufacturing side, Clayton has also b een activ e.  To  its o riginal base of twen ty plants, it \nfirst added twelve more in 2004 by way  of the ban kruptcy purchase of O akwood, which just  a few years \nearlier wa s one  of the la rgest companies in t he business.  Then in 2005 Clayton purchased Karst en, a four-\nplant operation th at greatly stren gthens Clayto n’s position on the West Co ast. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Long ago, Mark  Twain  said: “A m an who  tries to  carry a cat h ome by its tail will lear n a lesso n \nthat can  be learned in no other way.”  If Twain were around now, he might try winding up a der ivativ es \nbusiness.  After a few  days, he would opt  for cats. \n \n We lo st $1 04 million pre-tax  last year in  our con tinuing atte mpt to exit Gen  Re’s derivative \noperation.  Our aggregate losses since we began this endeavor total $404 million. \n \n Originally w e had 23,218 contracts ou tstand ing.  By th e start of 2005 we were dow n to 2,890.  \nYou might expect th at ou r losses wou ld have been stemme d by this point, but the blood h as kept flowing.  \nReducing our inventory to 741  contracts last y ear co st us the $1 04 million men tioned above. \n \n Remember th at th e rationale fo r estab lishing this un it in 19 90 was Gen Re’s wish to  meet th e \nneed s of insurance cl ients.  Yet one of the cont racts we liquidated in 2005 had a t erm of 1 00 years!  It ’s \ndiffic ult to im agine what “nee d” such a contract coul d fulfill except, perhaps, the nee d of a compensation-\nconsciou s trader to h ave a lon g-dated contract o n his book s.  Long contracts, or alter natively th ose with \nmultiple variables, are the m ost difficult to mark to m arket (the stan dard proce dure use d in accounting for \nderivatives) and  provide the most opportunity fo r “imagination” when trad ers are estimatin g their v alue.  \nSmall wo nder that trad ers prom ote them. \n \n A business in which huge amounts of compensat ion flow from assum ed numbers is obviously \nfraught with danger.  When t wo traders execute a transact ion that has se veral, som etimes esot eric, variables \nand a far-o ff settle ment date, th eir resp ective firm s must subsequently value these co ntracts wh enever they \ncalculate their earni ngs.  A gi ven c ontract may be val ued at one price by  Firm A and at  anot her by Firm B.  \nYou can bet that the val uation differences – and I’m personally fam iliar with  several that were huge – ten d \nto be tilted in a direction fa voring hi gher e arnings at each firm .  It’s a st range worl d in which two pa rties \ncan ca rry out a paper transaction that each can promptly report  as profitable. \n \n I dwell on our expe rience  in derivative s each year for two reas ons.  One is pe rsonal and \nunpleasant.  The hard fact is that I have c ost you a l ot of money  by not moving immediately to close do wn \n 10\n\nGen Re’s trad ing operation .  Both Charlie an d I knew at  the time of the Gen  Re pu rchase th at it was a \nproblem an d told its management that we wan ted to exit the business.  It was my resp onsibility to mak e \nsure t hat happened.  Rather than address t he situation hea d on, however, I wast ed se veral years w hile we \nattempted to sell the operat ion.  That  was  a doom ed en deav or beca use no real istic solution could have  \nextricated  us from the maze of liab ilities th at was go ing to ex ist fo r decades.  Our obligation s were  \nparticula rly worrisom e because thei r pote ntial to explode could not be measured.  More over, if s evere \ntrouble occurred, we knew it was lik ely to co rrelat e with prob lems elsewh ere in  financial markets. \n \n So I failed  in my atte mpt to exit painlessly, and  in the mean time more trad es were put on the \nbooks.  Fau lt me fo r dithering.  (Charlie calls it thumb-suc king.)  When a problem exists, whet her in \npersonnel or in bu siness operations, the tim e to act is now. \n \n The seco nd reason  I reg ularly d escrib e our prob lems in this area lies in  the ho pe th at our \nexpe riences may prove instructive for m anagers , auditors and re gulators.  In a sense , we are a canary in this  \nbusiness co al mine and should  sing  a son g of warning as we expire.  The nu mber and value of derivativ e \ncontracts out standing in the world continues to mushroom and i s now a m ultiple of wh at existed in 1998, \nthe last ti me that fin ancial ch aos erup ted. \n \n Our e xperie nce should be  particularly sobering because we we re a better-tha n-ave rage candidate  \nto exit gracefully.  Ge n Re was a  relativel y minor operat or in t he derivatives field.  It has had the good \nfortune to unwind its supposedly liquid positions i n a benign market, all the whi le free of financial or other \npress ures t hat might have forced it to conduct the liquidation in a less-than-efficient manner.  Our \naccounting in the past was conventiona l and actually thought to be conser vative.  Additionally, we know of  \nno bad behavior by anyone involved. \n \n It co uld be a differen t story for others in  the future.  Imag ine, if yo u will, o ne or more fir ms \n(troub les o ften spread) with  positions that are many multiples of ours atte mpting to liquidate in ch aotic \nmarkets and unde r extrem e, and well-publicized, press ures.

You \nknow, of course, of our leadersh ip position in men’s and boys’ unde rwear, in which we account \nfor about 48.7% of the sales recorde d by mass-m arketers (Wal-Mart, Ta rget, etc.).  T hat’s up from  \n44.2% in 2002, whe n we ac quired the com pany.  Operating from a sm aller base, we have m ade \nstill g reater g ains in intimate apparel fo r women and girls that is so ld by the mass-mark eters, \nclimbing fr om 13.7% of t heir sales in 2002 to 24.7% in 2005.  A gai n like that in a major cat egory \ndoesn’t com e easy .  Thank John Holland, Fruit’s extraordinary CEO, for making this happen. \n \n• I told you last year th at Ben  Brid ge (jewelry) a nd R.

You might think that blow-out figures in one \nyear wo uld mak e comparison s difficu lt in the following year.  Bu t Ed and Jon  Bridge at th eir \noperation  and Scott Hym as at R. C. Willey were m ore than up to th is challen ge.  Ben Bridge had a \n6.6% same-store gain in 2005, and  R. C. Willey ca me in at 9.9%. \n \nOur never-on-Sun day app roach at R. C. Willey co ntinues to overwh elm seven-day competitors as \nwe roll out stores in new m arkets.  The Bois e store, about which I was such a skeptic a few ye ars \nback , had a 21% gai n in 2005, coming of f a 10% gain in 2004.  Our new Reno store, opened in \nNovem ber, broke  out of the  gate fast with sales that exc eeded Boise’s early pace, a nd we will  \nbegin busine ss in Sacram ento in June .  If thi s store succeeds as I expect it to, Californians will see \nmany more R. C.

Our m ost recent expansi on, bri nging us \nto 42 training cen ters, is a major facility at Farn borough, Eng land that opened in September.  \nWhen it is fully built ou t in 2007, we will h ave invested more th an $100 million in the building \nand its 15  simu lators.  Bru ce Whitman, Flig htSafety’s ab le CEO, m akes sure th at no competitor \ncomes close to offering the breadth and depth of services that we do. \n \nOperating res ults at NetJets were a di fferent story .  I sai d last year th at this business would earn \nmoney in 2005 – and I was dead wrong. \n \nOur European operat ion, it should be not ed, showed both excel lent growth and a reduce d loss.  \nCustom er cont racts there inc reased by 37% .  We are t he only fractional-ownership operation of \nany size in Euro pe, a nd our now-pervasive prese nce there is a key  factor i n making NetJets the \nworldwid e lead er in this ind ustry. \n \nDespite a la rge increase  in c ustom ers, however, our U.S. operation dipped far into the red .  Its \nefficien cy fell, and  costs soared.  We b elieve that our three la rgest co mpetitors suffered  similar \nproblem s, but each is owne d by ai rcraft m anufact urers that may thi nk differently than we do a bout \nthe necessi ty of m aking ade quate profits.  The combi ned value of the fleets managed by  these \nthree c ompetitors , in any ca se, continues t o be less valua ble than the fleet that we  operate. \n \nRich  Santulli, one of the most dynamic managers I’v e ever m et, will so lve our rev enue/expense \nproblem.  He won ’t do it, howev er, in  a manner that impairs th e quality o f the NetJets ex perience.  \nBoth he and I are co mmitted  to a lev el of service, secu rity and safety t hat can ’t be match ed by \nothers. \n \n 13\n\n• Our retailing category includes See’s  Candies, a c ompany we bought early in 1972 (a date making \nit our oldest non-insurance  business).  At that time, Charlie and I immediately deci ded to put \nChuck Huggins, th en 46, in charge.  Thoug h we were new  at th e game o f selectin g managers, \nCharlie and  I hit a h ome run with this appo intment.  Ch uck’s love for the cu stomer and  the brand \nperm eated the organization, which in his 34-year tenure produced a m ore-than-tenfold increase i n \nprofits.  Th is gain was ach ieved in an indu stry growing at b est slowly an d perhaps no t at all.  \n(Volume figures in this industry are hard to pin down.) \n \nAt yeare nd, Chuck turned the reins  at See ’s over  to Brad K instler , who pr eviously had served \nBerkshire well while running Cypress  Insurance a nd Fec hheimer’s.  It’s unusual for us to move \nmanagers a round, but Brad’s reco rd m ade hi m an obvi ous choice for the See’s j ob.  I h ope C huck \nand his wife, Donna, a re at the annual m eeting.  If they are, sha reholders can join Cha rlie and m e \nin giving America’s n umber one candy maker a richly-deserved round of applause. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Every day, in countless ways, th e competitiv e position of each  of our businesses grows eith er \nweake r or stronger.  If we a re del ighting customers, el iminating u nnecessary  cost s and i mproving our \nproducts and services, we gain strength.  B ut if we t reat customers wi th indifference or tolerate bloat, our \nbusinesses will with er.  On  a daily basis, th e effects of our actio ns are im perceptible; cum ulatively, th ough, \ntheir consequences a re enormous. \n \n Whe n our l ong-term  com petitive position improves as a  result of these almost unnoticeable  \nactions, we des cribe the phenomenon as “wi dening the moat.”  An d doing that is essent ial if we are t o have  \nthe kind of bus iness we want a decade or two from  now .  We always, of course, hope t o earn m ore money  \nin the sho rt-term.  But when short-term  and long-term  conflict, wid ening the moat must  take precede nce.  If \na managem ent makes bad d ecisions i n order t o hit short-term earni ngs targets, and co nsequently gets \nbehind the eight-ball in terms of cost s, customer sat isfaction or brand strength, no am ount of s ubsequent \nbrillian ce will o vercome the damage that has b een inflicted .  Tak e a look at th e dilemmas o f managers in \nthe au to and airlin e industries to day as th ey strugg le with  the hug e problems handed them by their \npredecessors.  Charlie is fond of quoting Ben Franklin’s “An ounce of preventi on is worth a pound of \ncure.”  B ut someti mes n o amount of cure will o vercome the mistak es of t he past. \n \n Our m anagers focus on moat-wid ening – and are brillian t at it.  Quite sim ply, they are p assion ate \nabout their businesses.  Usually, they were ru nning those long before we cam e along; our only function \nsince has bee n to stay out  of the way .  If y ou see t hese her oes – an d our four heroines as wel l – at  the \nannual meetin g, thank them for th e job  they do for you . \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n The attitu de of ou r managers vividly contrasts with  that of the you ng man who married  a tyco on’s \nonly child, a decidedly homely and dul l lass.

How about sales?” \n“I’m  afraid I couldn’t sell wa ter to a man crawlin g in the Sah ara.” \n“Well then, how about heading human relatio ns?” \n“I really don’t care for people .” \n“No problem, we have  lots of other spots in the business.

(Th eir \nmanagers , of course, think my expect ations are too modest  – and I hope they’re right.) \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n The P&G-Gillette merger, cl osing in the fourth qu arter o f 2005, requ ired Berk shire to  record  a \n$5.0 billion pre-tax  capital g ain.  Th is bookkeeping entry, d ictated  by GAAP, is mean ingless from an  \necon omic standp oint, and you should ignore it when  you are eval uating Berkshire’s 2005 ea rnings.  We \ndidn’t intend to sell o ur Gillette sh ares b efore th e merger; we do n’t in tend to sell o ur P&G sh ares now; an d \nwe inc urred no tax when the merger t ook place. \n \n It’s h ard to overem phasize th e importance of who  is CEO o f a co mpany.  Befo re Jim Kilts arriv ed \nat Gillette  in 2001, the com pany was strugg ling, having particularly suffered  from cap ital-allo catio n \nblunde rs.  In the m ajor exa mple, Gillette’ s acquisiti on of Duracell cost Gillette sharehol ders billions of \ndollars, a loss never m ade visible by conventional accounting.  Quite simply, what Gillette  received in \nbusiness value in this acquisition was  not equi valent to what it gave u p.  (Amazingly, this most \nfundamental of yardsticks is alm ost always i gnored by  both managem ents and their investment bankers  \nwhen acqu isitio ns are und er discu ssion .) \n \n \n \n 15\n\n Upon  taking office at Gillett e, Jim quickly in stilled  fiscal d iscipline, tig htened operations and \nenergized marketing, m oves that dramatically in creas ed th e intrinsic v alue of the company.  Gillette’s \nmerger with P&G the n expa nded the potential of bot h com panies.  For his accom plishments, Jim  was paid \nvery well – but he earned e very pe nny.  (This is no acade mic evaluati on: As a 9.7% owne r of Gillette, \nBerk shire in  effect paid th at propo rtion  of his compensatio n.)  Indeed, it’s difficu lt to overpay th e truly \nextraordinary CEO of a giant enterprise.  B ut this species is rare. \n \n Too often, executive compensatio n in the U.S. is ridiculously o ut of lin e with perform ance.  That \nwon’t change, moreover , because t he deck  is stacked  against investors when it comes to the CEO’s pay.  \nThe u pshot is that a mediocre- or-worse CEO – ai ded by his handpicked VP of human rel ations and a \nconsultant from the ever-acc omm odating fi rm of Ratche t, Ratchet and B ingo – all too often receive s gobs \nof money fro m an ill-d esigned compensation  arran gement. \n \n Take, for instance, ten  year, fixed-price options (and who wo uldn’t?).  If Fred Futile, CEO of \nStagnant, Inc., receives a bundle of these – let’s say enough to give him  an opti on on 1% of t he com pany – \nhis self-in terest is clear: He sh ould sk ip dividends entirely and instea d use all of t he company’s earnings  to \nrepurchase stock. \n \n Let’s ass ume that under Fre d’s leade rship Stagna nt lives up to its n ame.  In each  of the ten  years \nafter th e option grant, it earns $1  billion on $10 billion of net worth, which initially comes to  $10 per share \non the 100 m illion sha res then outstanding.  Fred esc hews dividends and regularly uses al l earni ngs to \nrepurchase sh ares.  If th e stock  constan tly sells at  ten times earn ings per share, it will h ave appreciated \n158%  by t he end of t he option period.  T hat’s because  repurchases  would reduce t he number of s hares to \n38.7 million by that time, and earnings per share  would ther eby increase to $25.80.  Simply by withho lding \nearni ngs f rom owners, Fre d gets very  rich, m aking a cool  $158 m illion, des pite the business i tself \nimproving not at all.  Astonishingly, Fred coul d have m ade more than $100 million if Stagna nt’s ea rnings \nhad declined  by 20% during the ten-year period. \n \n Fred can also get a splendid resul t for himself by paying no dividends and deploying the earnings \nhe withholds from share holders into a variety of disappointing projects and acquisitions.  Even if these \ninitiativ es deliver a paltry 5% return , Fred will still make a bundle.  Specifically –  with Stagn ant’s p/e ratio \nremaining unc hange d at ten – Fre d’s option will deliv er him $63 m illion.  Meanwh ile, his share holders will \nwonder what happened to the “alignment of interests” that was s uppose d to occur when Fred was  issued \noptions. \n \n A “n ormal” divi dend policy, of co urse – one-third of ear nings pai d out, for e xample – pro duces \nless ex treme resu lts bu t still can  provide lush rewards for managers who  achieve nothing. \n \n CEOs understan d this math and kno w that ev ery dime paid out in dividends reduces th e value of \nall outstanding options.  I’ve neve r, however, seen this manager -owner conflict refe rence d in proxy \nmaterials that request a pproval of a  fixed-pri ced option plan.  Though CEOs invariably preac h interna lly \nthat capital comes at a cost, they so mehow forget to tell share holders that fixed-price opt ions give them \ncapital th at is free.  \n \n It does n’t have  to be this way : It’s chi ld’s play for a b oard to desi gn options that give effect to the \nautomatic build-up in valu e that occurs when ea rnings are retaine d.  But – surprise, surprise – options of \nthat kind are almost never issu ed.  Indeed, the very though t of options with strike prices th at are adj usted \nfor retained earni ngs seem s forei gn to com pensation “e xperts,” who are  nevert heless ency clopedic about \nevery  manage ment-frie ndly plan t hat exists.  (“Whose bre ad I eat, his song I sing.”) \n \n Getting fired can produce a par ticularly boun tiful payday fo r a CEO .  Indeed , he can “ear n” more \nin that sin gle day, wh ile clean ing out his desk, than an American worker ea rns in a lifetim e of cle aning \ntoilets.  Forget  the old m axim abou t nothi ng succee ding like success: T oday, in the e xecutive s uite, the  all-\ntoo-prevale nt rule is th at nothing succee ds like failure . \n \n \n 16\n\n Huge severance pay ments, lavish perks and outsized payments for ho-hum perf ormance often \noccur b ecause comp committees h ave become slav es to  comparativ e data.  Th e drill is simple: Th ree o r so \ndirectors – not chose n by chance – are bombarded for a few hours before a b oard meeting wi th pay \nstatistics th at perp etually ratch et upward s.  Additionally, t he committee i s told abou t new perks that other \nmanagers a re receiving.  In this manner, outlandis h “goodies” are showere d upon CEOs simply becaus e of \na cor porate version of the argument we al l used when children: “But, Mom, all the other ki ds ha ve one.”  \nWhen comp commi ttees fo llow th is “log ic,” yesterd ay’s m ost egre gious  excess bec omes today ’s baseline. \n \n Comp commit tees shou ld adop t the attitu de of Hank  Greenb erg, the Detroit slu gger and  a boyhood \nhero of mine.  Hank’s son, Steve, at one time was a player’s a gent.  Repr esenting an outfielder in \nnegotiations with a major league cl ub, Steve sou nded out his dad about the size of t he signing bonus he \nshould ask f or.  Hank , a true pay-for-performance guy , got straight to the point, “What did he hit last year?”  \nWhen Steve answered “.246,” Hank’s comeback was imm ediate: “As k for a uniform .” \n \n (Let me pause for a brief con fession: In criticizin g comp commit tee behavior, I do n’t speak as a \ntrue insider.  Though I have served as a director of twenty public companies, only one CEO has put me on \nhis comp commit tee.  Hmmmm .  . .) \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n My views  on America’s long-term  problem in resp ect to trade imbalances, which I have laid ou t in \nprevious reports, rem ain unchange d.  My conviction, however, cost Berkshire $955 million pre-tax in 2005.  \nThat amount is included in our earni ngs statement, a fact  that illustrates the differing ways in which GAAP \ntreats g ains and  losses.  When we have a lo ng-term position in stocks or bond s, year- to-year changes in  \nvalue a re reflected in our bal ance s heet but, as long as the asset is not s old, are rarely re flected in ea rnings.  \nFor example, our Coca-Co la holdings wen t from $1 billion  in value early o n to $13.4 billion at yearen d \n1998 and have since declin ed to  $8.1 billion – with  none of th ese m oves affecting  our earn ings statemen t.  \nLong-term  currency positions, however, are d aily m arked to m arket an d therefo re hav e an effect on \nearni ngs i n every reporting period.  From the dat e we fi rst entered into currency contracts, we are  $2.0 \nbillion in th e black. \n \n We re duced our direct position in c urrencies so mewhat during 200 5.  We p artially o ffset th is \nchange, however, by purchasing equities who se prices are denominated in a variety of foreign  currencies \nand that earn a large part of their profits internationally.  Charlie and I prefer this method of acquiring non-\ndollar exposure.  T hat’s largely because  of cha nges in interest rates: As U.S. rates ha ve risen relative to \nthose of the rest of the world, holding most foreign currencies now involves a si gnificant negative “ca rry.”  \nThe ca rry aspect of our direct currency position indee d cost us m oney  in 2005 and is likely to do so again in \n2006.  In contrast, th e ownership of fo reign equities is lik ely, o ver time, to create a p ositive carry – perhaps \na sub stantial one. \n \n The underlying factors affecting the U.S. c urrent account deficit continue to worse n, and no letup \nis in sight.  Not only did our trade deficit – the large st and most familiar item in the current account – hit an \nall-time high in 2005, but we also can e xpect a secon d item – the bal ance of i nvestment income – to soon \nturn negative.  As f oreigners increase t heir ownership of U.S. assets (or of claim s against us) relative to  \nU.S. inv estments abro ad, these in vestors will b egin earning more on their ho ldings than we do  on ours.  \nFinally, th e third co mponent of the current acco unt, unilateral transfers, is always negative.   \n \n The U.S., it sho uld be emphasized , is ex traord inarily rich an d will g et richer.  As a resu lt, the huge \nimbalances in its curre nt account m ay continue for a long time without their ha ving noticeable deleterious  \neffects on the U.S. eco nomy or on markets.  I doubt, however, that the situation will forev er rem ain benign.  \nEither Am erican s add ress the p roblem soon in a way we select, o r at so me point the problem will likely \naddress us in an unpleasant way of its own.  \n \n \n \n \n \n 17\n\nHow to Mini mize Investme nt Returns \n \n It’s b een an easy matter for Berk shire an d other own ers of Am erican  equities to  prosper ov er the \nyears.  Bet ween Decem ber 31, 1899 a nd Dece mber 31, 1999, to give a really lo ng-term  example, the Dow \nrose from 66 to 11,497.  (Guess wh at annual g rowth rate is requ ired to produce this resu lt; th e surpri sing \nansw er is at the end of this sect ion.)  This huge rise ca me about  for a simple reason:  Over the century \nAmerican busi nesses di d ext raordinarily well and i nvest ors rode the wav e of their prosperity.  Businesses \ncontinue to do well.  Bu t now sh areho lders, th rough a series o f self-in flicted wounds, are in  a major way  \ncutting the return s they will realize fro m their inv estments. \n \n The exp lanation of how th is is h appening b egins with a fu ndamental tru th: With  unimportant \nexceptions , such as ba nkruptcies in whic h some of a com pany’s los ses are  borne by cre ditors, the most that \nowners in aggregate can earn between now and Judgment Day is what their businesse s in aggregate earn. \nTrue , by buying and selling that is clever or lucky, investor A m ay take m ore than his share of the pie at the  \nexpe nse of investor B.  And, yes, all invest ors feel richer when st ocks soa r.  But an owner can exit only by \nhaving someone take hi s place.  If one investor sel ls high, another m ust buy high.  For owners as a whole, \nthere is sim ply no m agic – no showe r of m oney from  outer space – that will enable  them to extract wealth \nfrom  their companies  beyond that cr eated by the com panies them selves. \n \n Indee d, owners must earn les s than their businesse s earn because of “fric tiona l” costs.  And that’s  \nmy point: These costs are now being inc urred in  amounts that will cause share holders t o earn far less th an \nthey historically h ave. \n \n To understand h ow this toll has ballooned, imagine for a moment that all Am erican  corporation s \nare, and  always will b e, owned by a sin gle fam ily.  We’ll call th em the Gotrocks.  After p aying taxes on \ndividends, this family – ge neration after generation – becomes richer by the aggregate amount earned by its \ncompanies.  Today  that am ount is about $700 billion a nnually.  Naturally, the  family spends s ome of these \ndollars.  B ut the portio n it sav es stead ily co mpounds for its benefit.  In  the Go trocks ho usehold everyone \ngrows wealthier at the  same pace, and all is harm onious. \n \n But let’s now assum e that a  few fast-talki ng Help ers approach the fam ily and persuade each of its \nmembers to  try to outsmart his relativ es by buying certa in of th eir holdings and  sellin g them certain  others. \nThe Help ers – for a fee, of cou rse – ob ligingly ag ree to handle these tran sactio ns.  Th e Gotrocks still o wn \nall of c orporat e Am erica; the trades  just rearrange who ow ns w hat.  So the fam ily’s annual gain in wealth \ndiminishes, e qualing the earnings of Am erican busi ness minus commissions paid.  The more that family \nmembers trade , the sm aller their sha re of the  pie a nd the larger t he slice received by  the Helpers.  This fact \nis no t lost upon th ese broker-Helpers: Activity is th eir friend and, in a wide variety o f ways, th ey urge it on . \n \n After a while, most of the family members realize that the y are not doing so  well at th is new “b eat-\nmy-brot her” game.  Ent er another set of Helpers.  These newcomers explain t o each m ember of the \nGotrocks clan that by himself he’ll neve r outsmart the rest of the fam ily.  The suggested cure: “Hire a \nmanager – yes, us – an d get  the job done professionally.”  Th ese manager-Hel pers co ntinue to use th e \nbroker-Hel pers to execute tra des; th e managers m ay even increase thei r activity so  as to  permit the brokers \nto prosper still m ore.  Ov erall, a b igger slice of the pie now goes to th e two classes of Helpers. \n \n The family’s disappointment grows.  Each of its members is now em ploying professionals.  Yet \noverall, the group’s finances have taken a turn for the worse.  Th e solution?   More help, of co urse. \n \n It arri ves in the form  of financial p lanners and  institutional consultants, who weigh  in to advise the \nGotrocks on selecting m anager -Helpers.  The be fuddled fam ily wel comes this assi stance.  B y now its \nmembers know they ca n pick neither the right stocks nor the right stock-pickers.  Why , one might ask, \nshould they ex pect su ccess in picking the righ t con sultant?  But this question does no t occur to the \nGotrocks, and the consultant-Helpers certainly don’t suggest it to them. \n \n \n 18\n\n The Gotrocks, now supporting three cl asses of expensive Help ers, fi nd that their results get worse, \nand they si nk into despair.  B ut just a s hope  seem s lost, a fo urth group  – we’ll call th em the hyper-Hel pers \n– appea rs.  T hese friendly fol k explain t o the Gotrocks that their unsatisfactory re sults are occurrin g \nbecause the existing Helpers – brokers , managers , consultants – are not s ufficiently motivated and a re \nsimply going through the motions.  “ What,” the new Helpers as k, “ca n you ex pect from such a b unch of \nzombies?” \n \n The new arri vals offer a breath takingly simple so lution: Pay more  money .  Brimmin g with self-\nconfide nce, the hyper-Hel pers assert that huge c ontinge nt paym ents – in addition to s tiff fixed fees – are  \nwhat  each family member must fork over in order to really outmaneuve r his relatives. \n \n The more observant members of the family see that some o f the hyper-Help ers are really ju st \nmanager -Helpers weari ng n ew uni forms, beari ng sewn-on sexy nam es like HEDGE FUND  or PRIVAT E \nEQUI TY.  The new Helpers, however, assure the Gotrocks that this change of clothing is all-important, \nbestowing on its weare rs magical powers si milar to those acqui red by mild-mannere d Clark Kent  when he \nchan ged into his Superm an costume.  Calmed by this explanation, the family deci des to pay up. \n \n And that’s where we are today: A rec ord portion of the earnings that would go in their entirety to \nowners – if they all j ust stayed  in their rocking chairs – is no w going to a swelling  arm y of Helpers.  \nParticularly expensive is the recen t pandemic of profit arrangem ents under whic h Helpers receive large \nportion s of the winn ings when they are sm art or lu cky, and  leav e fam ily members with  all o f the losses –  \nand large fi xed fees t o boot – when the Helper s are dum b or unl ucky (o r occasionally crooke d). \n \n A su fficien t number of arran gements like this – heads, the Help er tak es much of the winn ings; \ntails, the Gotrocks lose a nd pay dear ly for the privilege of doi ng so – may make it more accurate to cal l the \nfamily the Ha drocks.  Today, in fact, the family’s fri ctional cost s of al l sorts may well amount to 20% of \nthe earnings of Am erican business.  In ot her words, the burden of paying Helpe rs may cause Am erican \nequity in vestors, ov erall, t o earn  only 80% or so  of what they wou ld earn  if they just sat still an d listen ed to \nno one. \n \n Long a go, Sir Isaac Newt on gave us t hree la ws of motion, whic h we re the  work of genius.  But Sir \nIsaac’s  talents didn’t e xtend t o investing: He lost a bundle in the  Sout h Sea Bubble,  explaining later, “ I can \ncalculate the movem ent of the stars, but not the madness  of men.”  If  he had not been traumatized b y this \nloss, Sir Isaac might well have gone on to  discover the Four th La w of Motion : For i nvestors as a whole, \nreturns  decrease as  motion increa ses. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Here ’s the ans wer to the question posed at the begi nning of this section: To get  very  specific, the \nDow increase d from 65.73 to 11,497.12 in the 20th cent ury, and that amounts to a gain of 5.3% \ncompounde d annually.  (Inve stors woul d also have receive d dividends, of course.)  T o achieve a n equal rate  \nof gain in the 21st century, t he Dow will ha ve to rise by Dece mber 31, 2099 to – brace yourself – precisely \n2,011,011.23.  Bu t I’m  willing to settle fo r 2,00 0,000 ; six years in to this cen tury, th e Dow h as gained not at \nall. \n \nDebt and Risk  \n \n As we c onsolidate MidAm erican, o ur new balance s heet may suggest  that Berkshi re has expa nded \nits tolerance for borrowing.  But that’s not so.  Exce pt for token am ounts, we shun debt, turning to it for \nonly three purposes:  \n \n1) We occasional ly use re pos a s a part of ce rtain s hort-term  investing st rategies that incorporate \nownership of U.S. governmen t (or ag ency) secu rities.  Pu rchases o f this kind are highly \nopportunistic and i nvolve only the most liquid of sec urities.  A f ew years ag o, we e ntered i nto \nseveral interest ing transactio ns th at have since been unwound or are runn ing off.  The offsettin g \ndebt has likewise bee n cut substantially and before long may be gone. \n 19\n\n2) We borrow money agai nst portfolio s of interest-bearing receivables whose risk cha racteristics we \nunderstand .  We did this in 2001 when we gu aranteed $5.6 billion  of bank debt to take over, in \npartnership wit h Leuca dia, a bankr upt Finova (which held a broa d range  of receiva bles).  All of \nthat debt  has been repaid.  More rece ntly, we ha ve b orrowed to finance a wi dely-diversified, \npredictably-perform ing portfolio of m anufact ured-home receiva bles managed by Clayton.  \nAlternatively, we c ould “ securitize” – that  is, sell – these  receiva bles, but re tain the  servicing of \nthem.  If we fo llowed this pro cedure, which is co mmon in the industry, we wou ld not show th e \ndebt that we do on our balance sheet, a nd we would als o accelerate the earni ngs we report.  In the  \nend, however, we w ould earn less m oney .  Were market variables t o change s o as to fa vor \nsecuritizatio n (an  unlikely ev ent), we cou ld sell p art of our portfolio and eliminate th e related  debt.  \nUntil then, we prefer b etter pro fits to b etter co smetics. \n \n3) At Mid American , we have substantial d ebt, but it is th at co mpany’s obligation only.  Tho ugh it \nwill appear on  our consolidated balance sh eet, Berk shire does not guarantee it. \n \nEven so, this debt is unquestionabl y secure beca use i t is serviced by MidAm erican’s diversified \nstream  of highly-stab le utility  earn ings.  If t here were to  be so me bolt fro m the blue that hurt one \nof MidAmerican ’s utility p roperties, earn ings from the others wo uld still b e more th an am ple to \ncove r all debt requirements.  M oreover, MidAm erican  retain s all of its earn ings, an  equity-\nbuilding practice th at is rare i n the utility field . \n \n From a risk  standpoint, it is far safer to  have earn ings from ten diverse an d uncorrelated  utility  \noperations that cove r interest char ges by, say, a 2: 1 ratio than it is to have fa r greater cove rage \nprovided by a single utility.  A catastrop hic event can  render a si ngle utility insolvent – witness \nwhat Kat rina did  to the local electric u tility in New Orleans –  no matter h ow conservative its d ebt \npolicy.  A ge ographical disaster – say , an e arthquake in a West ern state – can’t  have the sam e \neffect on MidAm erican.  And e ven a worrier lik e Ch arlie can ’t think of an event that wou ld \nsyste mically decrease utility ear nings in any major way.  Because of MidAm erican’s e ver-\nwide ning dive rsity of regulated earnings, it will always uti lize major am ounts  of debt. \n \n And that’s abo ut it.  We are no t interested  in incurring an y significan t debt at Berk shire for \nacquisition s or operating  purposes.  Conv entional business wisd om, of cou rse, would argu e that we are \nbeing too conservat ive and that there are a dded profits that coul d be sa fely earned i f we injected m oderate \nleverage into our balance sh eet. \n \n Maybe so.  B ut many of B erkshire’s hundreds of thousands of investors have a l arge portion of \ntheir net  worth in our st ock (among t hem, it shoul d be em phasized, a l arge number of ou r board and key  \nmanagers ) and a disaster for the com pany would be a disaster for them .  Moreove r, there are pe ople who \nhave been permanent ly injured to whom we o we insurance pay ments that stretch out for fi fty years or \nmore.  To  these an d other con stituencies we h ave promised total secu rity, wh atever co mes: fin ancial panics, \nstock-exc hange closures (a n extended one occurre d in 1914) or even dom estic nuclear, chem ical or \nbiological attacks. \n \n We a re quite willing to acce pt huge  risks.  Indeed , more tha n any other insure r, we write high-lim it \npolicies th at are tied  to sing le catastrop hic events.  We also  own  a larg e investment portfolio whose mark et \nvalue cou ld fall d ramatically and quickly under certain  conditions (as h appened on Octob er 19, 1987).  \nWhatever occurs, tho ugh, Berkshire will h ave the net worth, th e earn ings stream s and the liq uidity to  \nhandle the prob lem with  ease. \n \n Any other a pproach i s dangerous.  Over the years, a n umber of very smart peo ple have learne d the \nhard way th at a long string of im pressiv e numbers m ultiplied by a single zero always eq uals zero .  That is \nnot an equation whose ef fects I wo uld like to experience pers onally, and I would like eve n less to be \nrespon sible for imposing its penalties up on others. \n \n \n \n 20\n\nManageme nt Succession \n \n As owners, you are naturally concerned about whether I will in sist on  continuing as C EO after I \nbegin to fade and, if so , how the board will han dle that  problem.  Yo u also wan t to know what happens if I \nshould die tonight. \n \n That second question is eas y to answer.  Most of our many busi nesses ha ve st rong m arket \npositions, sign ifican t momentum, and terrifi c managers.  The special Berk shire culture is deeply ingrained \nthroughout our sub sidiaries, an d these op erations won’t m iss a beat whe n I die. \n \n Moreover, we have  three m anage rs at Berkshire wh o are reason ably young and fully capable  of \nbeing CEO.  Any of the three w ould be much better at certain manage ment aspect s of my job t han I.  On \nthe minus si de, none has m y cross over e xperience t hat allows m e to be comfortable making deci sions in \neither th e business aren a or in investments.  Th at problem will b e solved by having anoth er person in the \norganizatio n handle marketable securities.  Th at’s an  interestin g job at Berk shire, and th e new CEO wil l \nhave  no problem in hiring a talented individual to do it.  Indeed , that’s what we have done at GEICO for 26 \nyears, and our resu lts have been terrific. \n \n Berkshire’s board has fully discuss ed eac h of t he three CEO can didates and has unanimously \nagree d on the person who s hould succeed me if a repl acement were needed toda y.  The directors stay \nupdated on this subject  and could alter their view as ci rcumstances cha nge – new m anage rial stars may \nemerge and presen t ones will ag e.  Th e important point is th at the directors know now –  and will always  \nknow in th e future – ex actly wh at they will do  when the need arises. \n \n The other questio n that must be addressed  is wh ether the Board will b e prepared to make a ch ange \nif that need should arise not from my death but rathe r from  my decay, particularly  if this decay is  \naccom panied by my delusionally thi nking that I am  reac hing ne w peaks of m anage rial brilliance.  That \nproblem woul d not be uni que to me.  Charl ie and I have faced  this situ ation from t ime to time at \nBerks hire’s subsidiaries .  Humans age at greatly varyi ng rates – b ut sooner or later their talents and vigor \ndeclin e.  Some managers remain  effectiv e well in to their 80s – Charlie is a wo nder at 82 – and others \nnoticeably fade in their 60s.  When their abilities ebb, so usually do their powers of self-assessm ent.  \nSomeone el se often needs  to blow the whistle. \n \n When that time co mes for me, o ur board will h ave to step up to the job.  From a financial \nstandpoint, its members are un usually m otivated to do so.  I kno w of no other board in the coun try in  which \nthe financial interests of directors are s o completely aligned wi th those of shareholders.  Few b oards even \ncome close.  On a personal level, howe ver, it is e xtraordinarily d ifficu lt for most people to  tell so meone, \nparticularly a fr iend, that he or she is no longer  capable. \n \n If I become a candidate fo r that message, however, ou r board will be d oing me a favo r by \ndelivering it.  Every  share of Berk shire th at I own  is destined  to go to philanthropies, and I want s ociety to \nreap t he maximum good from these gi fts and bequests.  It woul d be a t ragedy  if the philanthropic potential \nof my holdings was d iminished because my asso ciates  shirked their respo nsibility t o (tend erly, I hope) \nshow m e the door.  B ut don’t worry ab out this.  We have an outstan ding group of directo rs, an d they will \nalway s do what’s right for shareholders. \n \n And while we are on the s ubject, I feel terrific. \n \nThe Annual Meeting  \n \n Our m eeting this year will b e on Saturd ay, May 6 .  As always, th e doo rs will o pen at th e Qwest \nCenter at 7  a.m., and the latest Berk shire movie will b e shown at 8:30.  At 9 :30 we will g o directly to  the \nquestion-and-an swer p eriod, which (with  a break for lunch at th e Qwest ’s stan ds) will last u ntil 3:00.  Then, \nafter a sho rt recess, Ch arlie an d I will co nvene the annu al meetin g at 3:15.  Th is sch edule wo rked well las t \nyear, because  it let those who wante d to attend the  form al session to do so, while freeing others to shop . \n \n 21\n\n You certain ly did your share in  this resp ect last year.  Th e 194,300 square fo ot hall adjo ining the \nmeetin g area was filled  with th e products of Berksh ire subsidiaries, and  the 21,000 people wh o cam e to the \nmeetin g allowed every locatio n to rack up sales record s.  Kelly Bro z (neé Mu chemore), th e Flo Zieg feld of \nBerks hire, orc hestrates both this magnificent shopping extravaga nza and the m eeting itself.  T he exhi bitors \nlove her, and so do I.  Kelly got married in October, and I gave her away.  She asked me how I wanted to \nbe listed in the wedding program.  I replied “envious of the groom,” and t hat’s the way it went  to press. \n \n This year we will showcase two Clayto n ho mes (featuring  Acm e brick, Shaw carpet, John s \nManville in sulation, MiTek  fasten ers, Carefree awnings and NFM furnitu re).  You will find that these  \nhomes, pri ced at $79,000 and $89,000, deliver excel lent value.  In fact, three sha reholders cam e so fi rmly \nto that con clusion last year that th ey bought the $119,000 model we t hen showcased.  Flanking the Cl ayton \nhomes on  the exhibition floor will b e RVs from Forest River. \n \n GEIC O will h ave a boo th staffed  by a nu mber of its to p counselors from around the coun try, all of \nthem read y to supply you  with auto insuran ce quotes.  In m ost cases, GEICO will b e able to give yo u a \nspecial shareholder discount (us ually 8%).  This sp ecial offer is perm itted by 45 of the 50 jurisdictions in \nwhich we operate.  (On e supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you  qualify fo r ano ther, such as \nthat given cert ain groups.)  Bring the details of y our existing insurance a nd check out whet her we ca n save \nyou m oney .  For at least 50% of you, I believe we ca n.  And while you’re at it, sign up for the new GEICO \ncredit ca rd.  It’s the one I now use . \n \n On Saturd ay, at the Omaha airpo rt, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets® \navailab le for your insp ection .  Stop  by the NetJets boo th at the Qwest t o learn a bout view ing these planes.  \nCome to Omaha by bus; leav e in your  new plane. \n \n The Bookworm  bouti que at the Qwest broke all rec ords last year selling Berk shire-related books .  \nAn amazing 3,500 of these were Poor Charlie’s Almanack , the collected wi sdom of my part ner.  This \nmean s that a co py was so ld every 9 second s.  And for good reaso n: You will never find a book with  more \nuseful ideas.  Word-of-mouth recom menda tions have ca used Charlie’s first printing of 20,500 copies to sell \nout, and we wi ll therefore have a revi sed and expa nded edition on sale at our meeting.  Among t he other 22 \ntitles an d DVDs av ailab le last year at t he Book worm, 4,597 cop ies were so ld for $84,746 .  Our \nshare holders are a bookseller’s dream . \n \n An attachm ent to t he proxy  material that is encl osed w ith th is report explains how you  can obtain \nthe cred ential yo u will n eed for ad mission to the meeting and other events.  As fo r plane, ho tel and car \nreser vations, we have a gain signed up American Ex press (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  Carol \nPede rsen, who handles t hese matters, doe s a terrifi c job for us each year, a nd I tha nk her for it. \n \n At Ne braska  Furniture  Mart, located on a 77-ac re site on 72nd Street between Dodge  and Pacific, \nwe will ag ain be having “Berk shire Week end” pricing .  We in itiated  this special ev ent at NFM n ine years \nago, and sales during the “Weeken d” grew from $5.3 m illion in 1997 to $27.4 million in 2005 (up 9% f rom \na year earlier).  I get goose bumps just thinking abou t this volume. \n \n To obtain th e discoun t, you  must make your purchases betw een Thu rsday, May 4  and Mo nday,  \nMay 8  inclusive, an d also  present your m eeting cred ential.  Th e period’s sp ecial p ricing  will ev en apply to \nthe products of several  prestigious m anufact urers that normally have i ronclad rules aga inst discounting but \nthat, in the spirit of our shareholder week end, have  made an exce ption for y ou.  We a ppreciate their \ncooperation.  NFM  is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m . Monday through S aturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p. m. on \nSunday .  On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., we a re having a speci al affair for shareholders \nonly.  I’ll be there, eat ing barbeque, drinking Coke, and counting sales. \n \n Borsheim ’s again will have t wo shareholde r-only eve nts.

During \nthat period, just identify yoursel f as a s hareholder through your m eeting c redentials or a brokerage \nstatement.   \n \n Borsheim’s op erates on a gross margin that, even before the share holders’ discount, is fully twenty \nperce ntage points below that of its major ri vals.  Last year, our sha reholder-period business increased 9% \nfrom 2004, which cam e on t op of a 73% gain the year before.  The store sold 5,000 Berkshire Monopoly \ngames – and then ran ou t.  We’ve learn ed: Plenty will b e in stock this year. \n \n In a ten t outside of Borsheim’s, Patrick  Wolff, twice U.S. ch ess ch ampion, will tak e on all co mers \nin groups of six – blindfolded.  Add itionally, we will h ave Bob  Hamm an and Sh aron Osberg, two of th e \nworld’s top bridge e xperts, available to play with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon.  They  plan to keep \ntheir eyes open – but Bob never sorts his cards, eve n when playing for a national champions hip. \n \n Gorat’s – my fav orite steak house – will again  be open exclu sively for Berk shire sh areholders on \nSunday, May 7, and  will b e serv ing from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  Please re member that to come to Gorat’s o n \nthat day, you must have a reservation .  To make one, call 4 02-551-3733 on April 1 (but not before).   \n \n In this schoo l year, ab out 35 university classes will co me to Omaha for sessio ns with  me.  I tak e \nalmost all – in  aggregate, perhaps 2, 000 students – to lunch at Gorat’s.  And they lov e it.  To  learn  why, \ncome join us on Sunday . \n \n We will again have a special r eception from 4:00 to 5: 30 on Saturd ay afternoon for sha reholde rs \nwho have come from outside of North America.  E very year our meeting dra ws many people from around \nthe globe, and Charlie and I want  to be sure we pe rsonally greet  those who have come so fa r.  Last  year we \nenjoyed meeting m ore than 400 of you from many dozen s of c ountries.  Any  shareholder who comes from \nother than the U.S. or Canada will b e given a special cred ential an d instructio ns for attend ing this function. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Charlie and  I are ex traord inarily lu cky.  We we re born in America; had  terrific parents who saw  \nthat we go t goo d educatio ns; h ave enjoyed wond erful families an d great h ealth ; and  came eq uipped with a \n“business” gene that allows us t o prosper in a m anner hugely disproportionate to other people who \ncontribute as much or m ore to our society’s well-being.   Moreover, we have l ong had jobs that we l ove, in \nwhich we are helped every day in  countless ways b y talented and chee rful associ ates.  No wonder we  tap-\ndance t o work.  But nothing is more fu n for us than getting together with our shareholder-partners at \nBerk shire’s annual meetin g.

In this table, Berkshire’s results \nthrough 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rule s.  In all other respects, the results are calculated using \nthe numbers originally reported. \nThe S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax  whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax .  If a corporation such as Berkshire \nwere simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appr opriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500 \nin years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index \nshowed a negative return.  Over the years, the tax cost s would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.  \n\n \nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. \n \n \nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hath away Inc.: \n \nOur gain in net worth during 2006 was $16.9 billion, which increased the per-share book value of \nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 18.4%.  Over the last 42 years (that is, since present management \ntook over) book value has grown from $19 to $7 0,281, a rate of 21.4% compounded annually.* \n \nWe believe that $16.9 billion is a record for a one-year gain in net worth – more than has ever \nbeen booked by any American business, leaving aside boosts that have occurred because of mergers (e.g., \nAOL’s purchase of Time Warner).  Of course, Exxon Mobil and other companies earn far more than Berkshire, but their earnings largely go to dividends and/or repurchases, rather than to building net worth. \n \nAll that said, a confession about our 2006 gain is in order.  Our most important business, \ninsurance, benefited from a large dose of luck:  Mother Nature, bless her heart, went on vacation.  After \nhammering us with hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 – storms that caused us to lose a bundle on super-cat insurance – she just vanished.  Last year, th e red ink from this activity turned black – very black. \n \nIn addition, the great majority of our 73 businesses did outstandingly well in 2006.  Let me focus \nfor a moment on one of our largest operations, GEICO.   What management accomplished there was simply \nextraordinary. \n \nAs I’ve told you before, Tony Nicely, GEICO’s CEO,  went to work at the company 45 years ago, \ntwo months after turning 18.  He became CEO in 1992, and from then on the comp any’s growth exploded.  \nIn addition, Tony has delivered staggering productivity  gains in recent years.  Between yearend 2003 and \nyearend 2006, the number of GEICO policies increased from 5.7 million to 8.1 million, a jump of 42%.  \nYet during that same period, the company’s employees (measured on a fulltime-equivalent basis) fell 3.5%.  \nSo productivity grew 47%.  And GEICO didn’t start fat. \n \nThat remarkable gain has allowed GEICO to maintain its all-important position as a low-cost \nproducer, even though it has dramatically increased advertising expenditures.  Last year GEICO spent $631 million on ads, up from $238 million in 2003 (and  up from $31 million in 1995,  when Berkshire took \ncontrol).  Today, GEICO spends far more on ads than any of its competitors, even those much larger.  We \nwill continue to raise the bar. \n \nLast year I told you that if you had a new son or grandson to be sure to name him Tony.  But Don \nKeough, a Berkshire director , recently had a better idea.  After reviewing GEICO’s performance in 2006, \nhe wrote me, “Forget births.  Tell the shareholders to immediately change the names of their present \nchildren to Tony or Antoinette.”  Don signed his letter “Tony.” \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nCharlie Munger – my partner and Berkshire’s vice chairman – and I run what has turned out to be \na big business, one with 217,000 employees and annual revenues approaching $100 billion.  We certainly \ndidn’t plan it that way.  Charlie began as a lawyer, and I thought of myself as a security analyst.  Sitting in \nthose seats, we both grew skeptical about the ability of big entities of any type to function well.  Size seems \nto make many organizations slow-thinking, resistant to change and smug.  In Churchill’s words: “We shape \nour buildings, and afterwards our buildings shape us.”  Here’s a telling fact: Of the ten non-oil companies \nhaving the largest market capitalization in 1965 – titans such as General Motors, Sears, DuPont and Eastman Kodak – only one made the 2006 list.   \n \n  \n * All per-share figures used in this report apply to  Berkshire’s A shares.  Figures for the B shares \nare 1/30th of those shown for the A. \n 3\n\nIn fairness, we’ve seen plenty of successes as well, some truly outstanding.  There are many giant-\ncompany managers whom I greatly admire; Ken Chenau lt of American Express, Jeff Immelt of G.E. and \nDick Kovacevich of Wells Fargo come quickly to mind.   But I don’t think I could do the management job \nthey do.  And I know I wouldn’t enjoy many of the duties that come with their positions – meetings, \nspeeches, foreign travel, the charity  circuit and governmental relations.  For me, Ronald Reagan had it \nright: “It’s probably true that hard work never killed anyone – but why take the chance?” \n \nSo I’ve taken the easy route, just sitting back and working through great managers who run their \nown shows.  My only tasks are to cheer them on, sculpt and harden our corporate culture, and make major capital-allocation decisions.  Our managers have returned this trust by working hard and effectively. \n \nFor their performance over the last 42 years – and particularly for 2006 – Charlie and I thank \nthem. \n \nYardsticks \n \n Charlie and I measure Berkshire’s progress and eval uate its intrinsic value in a number of ways. \nNo single criterion is effective in doing these jobs, and even an avalanche of statistics will not capture some factors that are important.  For example, it’s essential that we have managers much younger than I available \nto succeed me.  Berkshire has never been in better shap e in this regard – but I can’t prove it to you with \nnumbers. \n \n There are two statistics, however, that are of real importance.  The first is the amount of \ninvestments (including cash and cash-equivalents) that we own on a per-share basis.  Arriving at this figure, we exclude investments held in ou r finance operation because these are largely offset by  borrowings.  \nHere’s the record since present manage ment acquired control of Berkshire: \n \n \nYear \nPer-Share Investments * \n  \n1965 ..................................................................... $         4 \n1975 ..................................................................... 159 \n1985 ..................................................................... 2,407 \n1995 ..................................................................... 21,817 \n2006 ..................................................................... $80,636\nCompound Growth Rate 1965-2006....................        27.5% \nCompound Growth Rate 1995-2006....................        12.6% \n  *Net of minority interests \n \n In our early years we put most of our retained earnings and insurance float into investments in \nmarketable securities.  Because of this emphasis, and because the securities we  purchased generally did \nwell, our growth rate in investments was for a long time quite high. \n \n Over the years, however, we have focused more and more on the acquisition of operating businesses.  Using our funds for these purchases has bo th slowed our growth in investments and accelerated \nour gains in pre-tax earnings from non-insurance businesses, the second yardstick we use.  Here’s how those earnings have looked: \n 4\n\n \nYear Pre-Tax Earnings Per Share * \n  \n1965 ..................................................................... $        4 \n1975 ..................................................................... 4 \n1985 ..................................................................... 52 \n1995 ..................................................................... 175 \n2006 ..................................................................... $3,625\nCompound Growth Rate 1965-2006 ....................        17.9% \nCompound Growth Rate 1995-2006 ....................        31.7% \n *Excluding purchase-accounting adjustments and net of minority interests \n \n Last year we had a good increase in non-insurance earnings – 38%.  Large gains from here on in, \nthough, will come only if we are able to make major, and sensible , acquisitions.  That will not be easy.  We \ndo, however, have one advantage: More and more, Berkshire has become “the buyer of choice” for \nbusiness owners and managers.  Initially, we were view ed that way only in the U.S. (and more often than \nnot by private companies).  We’ve long wanted, noneth eless, to extend Berkshir e’s appeal beyond U.S. \nborders.  And last year, our globe-trotting finally got underway. \n \nAcquisitions \n \n We began 2006 by completing the three acquisitions pending at yearend 2005, spending about $6 \nbillion for PacifiCorp, Business Wire and Applied Underwriters.  All are performing very well. \n \n The highlight of the year, however, was our July 5th acquisition of most of ISCAR, an Israeli \ncompany, and our new association with its chairman , Eitan Wertheimer, and CEO, Jacob Harpaz.  The \nstory here began on October 25, 2005, when I received a 1¼-page letter from Eitan, of whom I then knew \nnothing.  The letter began, “I am writing to introdu ce you to ISCAR,” and proceeded to describe a cutting-\ntool business carried on in 61 countries.  Then Eitan wrote, “We have for some time considered the issues \nof generational transfer and ownership that are typical for large family enterprises, and have given much thought to ISCAR’s future.  Our conclusion is that  Berkshire Hathaway would be the ideal home for \nISCAR.  We believe that ISCAR would continue to thrive as a part of your portfolio of businesses.” \n \nOverall, Eitan’s letter made the quality of the company and the character of its management leap \noff the page.  It also made me want to learn more, and in November, Eitan, Jacob and ISCAR’s CFO, Danny Goldman, came to Omaha.  A fe w hours with them convinced me that  if we were to make a deal, we \nwould be teaming up with extraordinarily talented ma nagers who could be trusted to run the business after \na sale with all of the energy and dedication that they had exhibited previously.  However, having never bought a business based outside of the U.S. (though I had bought a number of foreign stocks), I needed to \nget educated on some tax and jurisdictional matters.  With that task completed, Berkshire purchased 80% of \nISCAR for $4 billion.  The remaining 20% stays in the hands of the Wertheimer family, making it our valued partner. \n \n ISCAR’s products are small, consumable cutting tool s that are used in conjunction with large and \nexpensive machine tools.  It’s a business without magic except for that imparted by the people who run it.  \nBut Eitan, Jacob and their associates are true managerial magicians who constantly develop tools that make \ntheir customers’ machines more productive.  Th e result: ISCAR makes money because it enables its \ncustomers to make more  money.  There is no better recipe for continued success. \n 5\n\n In September, Charlie and I, along with five Be rkshire associates, visited ISCAR in Israel.  We – \nand I mean every one of us – have never been more impressed with any operation.  At ISCAR, as \nthroughout Israel, brains and energy are ubiquitous.  Berkshire share holders are lucky to have joined with \nEitan, Jacob, Danny and their talented associates. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n A few months later, Berkshire again became “the buyer of choice” in a deal  brought to us by my \nfriend, John Roach, of Fort Worth.  John, many of you will remember, was Chairman of Justin Industries, which we bought in 2000.  At that time John was helping John Justin, who was terminally ill, find a \npermanent home for his company.  John Justin died soon after we bought Justin Industries, but it has since been run exactly as we promised him it would be. \n \n Visiting me in November, John Roach brought along Paul Andrews, Jr., owner of about 80% of \nTTI, a Fort Worth distribut or of electronic components.  Over a 35-year period, Paul built TTI from \n$112,000 of sales to $1.3 billion.  He is  a remarkable entrepreneur and operator. \n \n Paul, 64, loves running his business.  But not long ago he happened to witness how disruptive the \ndeath of a founder can be both to a private company’s employees and the owner’s family.  What starts out as disruptive, furthermore, often evolves into destructive.  About a year ago, therefore, Paul began to think \nabout selling TTI.  His goal was to put his business in the hands of an owner he had carefully chosen, rather \nthan allowing a trust officer or lawyer to conduct an auction after his death. \n \n Paul rejected the idea of a “strategic” buyer, knowing that in the pursuit of “synergies,” an owner \nof that type would be apt to dismantle what he had so carefully built, a move that would uproot hundreds of his associates (and perhaps wound TTI’s business in the process).  He also ruled out a private equity firm, \nwhich would very likely load the company with debt and then flip it as soon as possible. \n \n That left Berkshire.  Paul and I met on the morning of November 15th and made a deal before \nlunch.  Later he wrote me: “After our meeting, I am c onfident that Berkshire is the right owner for TTI . . . \nI am proud of our past and excited about our future.”  And so are Charlie and I. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n We also made some “tuck-in” acquisitions during 2006 at Fruit of the Loom (“Fruit”), MiTek, \nCTB, Shaw and Clayton.  Fruit made the largest purchases.  First, it bought Russell Corp., a leading \nproducer of athletic apparel and uniforms for about $1.2 billion (including assumed debt) and in December it agreed to buy the intimate apparel business of VF Corp.  Together, these acquisitions add about $2.2 \nbillion to Fruit’s sales and bring with them about 23,000 employees. \n \n Charlie and I love it when we can acquire busine sses that can be placed under managers, such as \nJohn Holland at Fruit, who have already shown their stuff at Berkshire.  MiTek, for example, has made 14 \nacquisitions since we purchased it in 2001, and Gene T oombs has delivered results from these deals far in \nexcess of what he had predicted.  In effect, we leverage  the managerial talent alr eady with us by these tuck-\nin deals.  We will make many more. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n We continue, however, to need “elephants” in order for us to use Berkshire’s flood of incoming cash.  Charlie and I must therefore ignore the pursuit of mice and focus our acquisition efforts on much bigger game. \n \nOur exemplar is the older man who crashed his gr ocery cart into that of  a much younger fellow \nwhile both were shopping.  The elderly man explained apologetically that he had lost track of his wife and \nwas preoccupied searching for her.  His new acquain tance said that by coincidence his wife had also \nwandered off and suggested that it might be more efficient if they jointly looked for the two women.  \nAgreeing, the older man asked his new companion what his wife looked like.  “She’s a gorgeous blonde,” \nthe fellow answered, “with a body th at would cause a bishop to go through a stained glass window, and \nshe’s wearing tight white shorts.  How about yours?”  The senior citizen wasted no words: “Forget her, we’ll look for yours.” \n 6\n\nWhat we are looking for is described on page 25.  If  you have an acquisition candidate that fits, \ncall me – day or night.  And then watch me shatter a stained glass window. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Now, let’s examine the four majo r operating sectors of Berkshire.  Lumping their financial figures \ntogether impedes analysis.  So we’ll look at them as four separate businesses, starting with the all–\nimportant insurance group. \n \nInsurance  \n \n Next month marks the 40th anniversary of our entrance into the insurance business.  It was on \nMarch 9, 1967, that Berkshire purchased National Indemnity and its companion company, National Fire & \nMarine, from Jack Ringwalt for $8.6 million. \n \n Jack was a long-time friend of mine and an ex cellent, but somewhat eccentr ic, businessman.  For \nabout ten minutes every year he would get the urge to sell his company.  But those moods – perhaps \nbrought on by a tiff with regulators or an unfavorable jury verdict – quickly vanished. \n \n In the mid-1960s, I asked investment banker Charlie Heider, a mutual friend of mine and Jack’s, to alert me the next time Jack was “in heat.”  When Charlie’s call came, I sped to meet Jack.  We made a \ndeal in a few minutes, with me waiving an audit, “due diligence” or anything else that would give Jack an \nopportunity to reconsider.  We just shook hands, and that was that. \n \n When we were due to close the purchase at Char lie’s office, Jack was late.  Finally arriving, he \nexplained that he had been driving around looking for a parking meter with some unexpired time.  That was \na magic moment for me.  I knew then that Jack was going to be my kind of manager. \n \n When Berkshire purchased Jack’s two insurers, they had “float” of $17 million.  We’ve regularly offered a long explanation of float in earlier reports, which you can read on our website.  Simply put, float \nis money we hold that is not ours but which we get to invest. \n \n At the end of 2006, our float had grown to $50.9 billion, and we have since written a huge retroactive reinsurance contra ct with Equitas – which I will describe in the next section – that boosts float \nby another $7 billion.  Much of the gain we’ve made has come through our acquisition of other insurers, but we’ve also had outstanding internal growth, particularly at Ajit Jain’s amazing reinsurance operation.  Naturally, I had no notion in 1967 that our float would develop as it has.  There’s much to be said for just \nputting one foot in front of the other every day. \n \n The float from retroactive reinsurance contracts, of which we have many, automatically drifts down over time.  Therefore, it will be difficult for us  to increase float in the future unless we make new \nacquisitions in the insurance field.  Whatever its size, however, the all-important cost of Berkshire’s float \nover time is likely to be significantly below that of the industry, perhaps even falling to less than zero.  \nNote the words “over time.”  There will be bad years periodically.  You can be sure of that. \n \n In 2006, though, everything went right in insurance – really  right.  Our managers – Tony Nicely \n(GEICO), Ajit Jain (B-H Reinsurance), Joe Brandon and Tad Montross (General Re), Don Wurster \n(National Indemnity Primary), Tom Nerney (U.S. Li ability), Tim Kenesey (M edical Protective), Rod \nEldred (Homestate Companies and Cypress), Sid Ferenc and Steve Menzies (Applied Underwriters), John \nKizer (Central States) and Don Towle (Kansas Bankers Surety) – simply shot the lights out.  When I recite \ntheir names, I feel as if I’m at Cooperstown, reading from the Hall of Fame roster.  Of course, the overall \ninsurance industry also had a terrific year in 2006.  But our managers delivered results generally superior to \nthose of their competitors. \n 7\n\n Below is the tally on our underwriting and float fo r each major sector of insurance.

Or were they our plan et’s first warning that the climate of the 21st Century will \ndiffer materially from what we’ve seen in the past?  If  the answer to the second question is yes, 2006 will \nsoon be perceived as a misleading period of calm pr eceding a series of devasta ting storms.  These could \nrock the insurance industry.  It’s naïve to think of  Katrina as anything close to a worst-case event. \n \n Neither Ajit Jain, who manages our super-cat operation, nor I know what lies ahead.  We do know \nthat it would be a huge mistake to bet that evolving atmospheric changes are benign in their implications for insurers. \n \n Don’t think, however, that we have lost our taste for risk.  We remain prepared to lose $6 billion in a single event, if we have been paid appropriately for assuming that risk.  We are not willing, though, to \ntake on even very small exposures at prices that don’t reflect our evaluation of loss probabilities.  \nAppropriate prices don’t guarantee profits in any given year, but inappropriate prices most certainly guarantee eventual losses.  Rates have recently fallen because a flood of capital has entered the super-cat \nfield.  We have therefore sharply reduced our wind exposures.  Our behavior here parallels that which we \nemploy in financial markets: Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. \n \nLloyd’s, Equitas and Retroactive Reinsurance \n \n Last year – we are getting now to Equitas – Berkshire agreed to enter into a huge retroactive reinsurance contract, a policy that protects an insurer against losses that have already happened, but whose cost is not yet known.  I’ll give you details of the ag reement shortly.  But let’s first take a journey through \ninsurance history, following the route that led to our deal. \n \n Our tale begins around 1688, when Edward Lloyd opened a small coffee house in London.  \nThough no Starbucks, his shop wa s destined to achieve worldwide fame because of the commercial \nactivities of its clientele – shipowners, merchants and venturesome British capitalists.  As these parties \nsipped Edward’s brew, they began to write contracts tr ansferring the risk of a disaster at sea from the \nowners of ships and their cargo to the capitalists, who wagered that a given voyage would be completed without incident.  These capita lists eventually became known as  “underwriters at Lloyd’s.” \n \n Though many people believe Lloyd’s to be an insurance company, that is not the case.  It is instead a place  where many member-insurers transact business, just as they did centuries ago. \n \n Over time, the underwriters solicited passive in vestors to join in syndicates.  Additionally, the \nbusiness broadened beyond marine risks into every imaginable form of insurance, including exotic \ncoverages that spread the fame of Lloyd’s far and wide.  The underwriters left the coffee house, found \ngrander quarters and formalized some rules of association.  And those persons who passively backed the underwriters became known as “names.” \n 8\n\n Eventually, the names came to include many thousands of people from around the world, who \njoined expecting to pick up some extra change without effort or serious risk.  True, prospective names were \nalways solemnly told that they would have unlimited and everlasting liability for the consequences of their \nsyndicate’s underwriting – “down to the last cufflink,” as the quaint description went.  But that warning came to be viewed as perfunctory.  Three hundred years of retained cufflinks acted as a powerful sedative \nto the names poised to sign up. \n \n Then came asbestos.  When its prospective costs were added to the tidal wave of environmental \nand product claims that surfaced in the 1980s, Lloyd’ s began to implode.  Policies written decades earlier – \nand largely forgotten about – were developing huge losses.  No one could intelligently estimate their total, but it was certain to be many tens of billions of dollars.  The specter of unending and unlimited losses \nterrified existing names and scared away prospects.  Many names opted for bankruptcy; some even chose \nsuicide. \n \n From these shambles, there came a desperate effort  to resuscitate Lloyd’s.  In 1996, the powers \nthat be at the institution allotted £11.1 billion to a new company, Equitas, and made it responsible for paying all claims on policies written before 1993.  In effect, this plan pooled the misery of the many \nsyndicates in trouble.  Of course, the money allotted could prove to be insufficient – and if that happened, the names remained liable for the shortfall. \n \nBut the new plan, by concentrating all of the liabilities in one place, had the advantage of \neliminating much of the costly intramural squabbling that went on among syndicates.  Moreover, the \npooling allowed claims evaluation, negotiation and litigation to be handled more intelligently than had been \nthe case previously.  Equitas embraced Ben Franklin’s thinking: “We must all hang together, or assuredly \nwe shall hang separately.”  \n \n From the start, many people predicted Equitas would eventually fail.  But as Ajit and I reviewed the facts in the spring of 2006 – 13 years after th e last exposed policy had been written and after the \npayment of £11.3 billion in claims – we concluded that the patient was likely to survive.  And so we decided to offer a huge reinsurance policy to Equitas. \n \n Because plenty of imponderables continue to exist, Berkshire could not provide Equitas, and its 27,972 names, unlimited protection.  But we said – and I’m simplifying – that if Equitas would give us \n$7.12 billion in cash and securities (this is the float I spoke about), we would pay all of its future claims and \nexpenses up to $13.9 billion.  Th at amount was $5.7 billion above what Equitas had recently guessed its \nultimate liabilities to be.  Thus the names received a huge – and almost certainly sufficient – amount of \nfuture protection against unpleasant su rprises.  Indeed the protection is so large that Equitas plans a cash \npayment to its thousands of names, an event few of them had ever dreamed possible. \n \n And how will Berkshire fare?  That depends on how much “known” claims will end up costing us, how many yet-to-be-presented claims will surface and what they will cost, how soon claim payments will \nbe made and how much we earn on the cash we receive be fore it must be paid out.  Ajit and I think the odds \nare in our favor.  And should we be wrong, Berkshire can handle it. \n \n Scott Moser, the CEO of Equitas, summarized th e transaction neatly: “Names wanted to sleep \neasy at night, and we think we’ve just bought them the world’s best mattress.” \n* * * * * * * * * * * \nWarning: It’s time to eat your broccoli – I am now going to talk about accounting matters.  I owe \nthis to those Berkshire shareholders who love reading about debits and credits.  I hope both of you find this discussion helpful.  All others can skip this section; there will be no quiz. \n \n Berkshire has done many retroactive transactions – in both number and amount a multiple of such \npolicies entered into by any other insurer.  We are the reinsurer of choice for these coverages because the \nobligations that are transferred to us – for example, lifetime indemnity and medical payments to be made to injured workers – may not be fully satisfied for 50 years or more.  No other company can offer the certainty  \n 9\n\nthat Berkshire can, in terms of guaranteeing the full and fair settlement of these obligations.  This fact is \nimportant to the original insurer, policyholders and regulators. \n \n The accounting procedure for retro active transactions is neither well known nor intuitive.  The \nbest way for shareholders to understand it, therefore, is for us to simply lay out the debits and credits.  \nCharlie and I would like to see this done more often.  We sometimes encounter accounting footnotes about \nimportant transactions that leave us baffled, and we go away suspicious that the reporting company wished it that way.  (For example, try comprehending trans actions “described” in the old 10-Ks of Enron, even \nafter you know  how the movie ended.) \n \nSo let us summarize our accounting for the Equitas transaction.  The major debits will be to Cash \nand Investments, Reinsurance Recoverable, and Deferred Charges for Reinsurance Assumed (“DCRA”).  The major credit will be to Reserve for Losses and Loss  Adjustment Expense.  No profit or loss will be \nrecorded at the inception of the transaction, but underw riting losses will thereafter be incurred annually as \nthe DCRA asset is amortized downward.  The amount of the annual amortization charge will be primarily determined by how our end-of-the-year estimates as to the timing and amount of future loss payments \ncompare to the estimates made at the beginning of the y ear.  Eventually, when the last claim has been paid, \nthe DCRA account will be reduced to zero.  That day is 50 years or more away. \n \n What’s important to remember is that retroac tive insurance contracts always produce underwriting \nlosses for us.  Whether these losses are worth experien cing depends on whether the cash we have received \nproduces investment income that exceeds the losses.  Recently our DCRA charges have annually delivered \n$300 million or so of underwriting losses, which have been more than offset by the income we have \nrealized through use of the cash we received as a pr emium.  Absent new retroactive contracts, the amount \nof the annual charge would normally  decline over time.  After the Equ itas transaction, however, the annual \nDCRA cost will initially increase to about $450 million a year.  This means that our other insurance operations must generate at least that much underwriting gain for our overall float to be cost-free.  That amount is quite a hurdle but one that I believe we will clear in many, if not most, years. \n \n Aren’t you glad that I promised you there would be no quiz? \n \nManufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations \n \n Our activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront.  Let’s look, though, at a summary balance sheet and earnings stat ement for the entire group. \n \nBalance Sheet 12/31/06 (in millions)\n    \nAssets  Liabilities and Equity  \nCash and equivalents .............................. $  1,543 Notes payable ............................ $  1,468 \nAccounts and notes receivable ............... 3,793 Other current liabilities..............     6,635\nInventory ................................................ 5,257 Total current liabilities .............. 8,103 \nOther current assets ................................        363   \nTotal current asse ts................................. 10,956   \n    \nGoodwill and other intangibles............... 13,314 Deferred taxes............................ 540 \nFixed assets............................................. 8,934 Term debt and ot her liabilities... 3,014 \nOther assets.............................................     1,168 Equity ........................................   22,715\n $34,372   $34,372  \n 10\n\n \nEarnings Statement (in millions)\n 2006 2005 2004\nRevenues .................................................................................  $52,660 $46,896 $44,142 \nOperating expenses (including depreciation of $823 in 2006,    \n $699 in 2005 and $67 6 in 2004).......................................  49,002 44,190 41,604 \nInterest expense .......................................................................         132          83         57\nPre-tax earnings.......................................................................  3,526* 2,623* 2,481* \nIncome taxes and mi nority interests ........................................      1,395        977        941\nNet income ..............................................................................  $  2,131  $  1,646  $  1,540  \n*Does not include purchase-accounting adjustments. \n \n  This motley group, which sells products ranging from lollipops to motor homes, earned a pleasing \n25% on average tangible net worth last year.  It’s not eworthy also that these op erations used only minor \nfinancial leverage in achieving that return.  Clearly we own some terrific businesses.  We purchased many \nof them, however, at large premiums to net worth – a point reflected in the goodwill item shown on the \nbalance sheet – and that fact re duces the earnings on our average carrying  value to 10.8%. \n \n Here are a few newsworthy items about companies in this sector: \n \n• Bob Shaw, a remarkable entrepreneur who from a standing start built Shaw Industries into the \ncountry’s largest carpet producer, elected last y ear, at age 75, to retire.  To succeed him, Bob \nrecommended Vance Bell, a 31-year veteran at Shaw, and Bob, as usual, made the right call.  Weakness in housing has caused the carpet business to slow.  Shaw, however, remains a powerhouse and a major contributor to Berkshire’s earnings.  \n \n• MiTek, a manufacturer of connectors for roof trusses at the time we purchased it in 2001, is \ndeveloping into a mini-conglomerate.  At the rate it is growing, in fact, “mini” may soon be \ninappropriate.  In purchasing MiTek for $420 million, we lent the company $200 million at 9% and bought $198 million of stock, priced at $10,000 per share.  Additionally, 55 employees bought \n2,200 shares for $22 million.  Each employee paid exactly  the same price that we did, in most \ncases borrowing money to do so. \n \nAnd are they ever glad they did!  Five years later, MiTek’s sales have tripled and the stock is \nvalued at $71,699 per share.  Despite its making 14 acquisitions, at a cost of $291 million, MiTek has paid off its debt to Berkshire and holds $35 million of cash.  We celebrated the fifth \nanniversary of our purchase with a party in July.  I told the group that it would be embarrassing if \nMiTek’s stock price soared beyond that of Berkshire “A” shares.  Don’t be surprised, however, if that happens (though Charlie and I will try to make our shares a moving target). \n \n• Not all of our businesses are destined to increase profits.  When an industry’s underlying economics are crumbling, talented management may slow the rate of decline.  Eventually, though, \neroding fundamentals will overwhelm managerial br illiance.  (As a wise friend told me long ago, \n“If you want to get a reputation as a good businessman , be sure to get into a good business.”)  And \nfundamentals are definitely eroding in the newspaper industry, a trend that has caused the profits \nof our Buffalo News to decline.  The skid will almost certainly continue. \n \nWhen Charlie and I were young, the newspaper business was as easy a way to make huge returns \nas existed in America.  As one not-too-bright publisher famously said, “I owe my fortune to two great American institutions: monop oly and nepotism.”  No paper in  a one-paper city, however bad \nthe product or however inept the management, could avoid gushing profits. \n \nThe industry’s staggering returns could be simply explained.  For most of the 20th Century, \nnewspapers were the primary source of informati on for the American public.  Whether the subject \nwas sports, finance, or politics, newspapers reigned supreme.  Just as important, their ads were the \neasiest way to find job opportunities or to learn the price of groceries at your town’s supermarkets.   \n 11\n\nThe great majority of families therefore felt the need for a paper every day, but understandably \nmost didn’t wish to pay for two.  Advertisers preferred the paper with the most circulation, and \nreaders tended to want the paper with the most ad s and news pages.  This circularity led to a law \nof the newspaper jungle: Survival of the Fattest.  \n \nThus, when two or more papers existed in a major city (which was almost universally the case a \ncentury ago), the one that pulled ahead usually  emerged as the stand-alone winner.  After \ncompetition disappeared, the paper’s pricing power in both advertising and circulation was \nunleashed.  Typically, rates for both advertisers and readers would be raised annually – and the \nprofits rolled in.  For owners this was economic heaven.  (Interestingly, though papers regularly – and often in a disapproving way – reported on the profitability of, say, the auto or steel industries, \nthey never enlightened readers about their own Midas-like situation.  Hmmm . . .) \n \nAs long ago as my 1991 letter to shareholders, I non etheless asserted that this insulated world was \nchanging, writing that “the media businesses . . . will prove considerably less marvelous than I, the industry, or lenders thought would be the case only a few years ago.”  Some publishers took \numbrage at both this remark and other warnings from me that followed.  Newspaper properties, \nmoreover, continued to sell as if they were indestructible slot machines.  In fact, many intelligent newspaper executives who regularly chronicled and analyzed important worldwide events were \neither blind or indifferent to what was going on under their noses.  \n \nNow, however, almost all newspaper owners reali ze that they are constantly losing ground in the \nbattle for eyeballs.  Simply put, if cable and satellite broadcasting, as well as the internet, had \ncome along first, newspapers as we know them probably would never have existed. \n \nIn Berkshire’s world, Stan Lipsey does a te rrific job running the Buffalo News, and I am \nenormously proud of its editor, Margaret Sullivan.  The News’ penetration of its market is the highest among that of this country’s large newspapers.  We also do better financially than most \nmetropolitan newspapers, even though Buffalo’s population and business trends are not good.  \nNevertheless, this operation faces unrelenting pres sures that will cause pr ofit margins to slide. \n \nTrue, we have the leading online news operation in Buffalo, and it will continue to attract more \nviewers and ads.  However, the economic potential of a newspaper internet site – given the many \nalternative sources of information and entertainment that are free and only a click away – is at best \na small fraction of that existing in the past for a print newspaper facing no competition. \n \nFor a local resident, ownership of a city’s paper, like ownership of a sports team, still produces \ninstant prominence.  With it typically comes power a nd influence.  These are ruboffs that appeal to \nmany people with money.  Beyond that, civic-minded, wealthy individuals may feel that local \nownership will serve their community well. That’s why Peter Kiewit bought the Omaha paper \nmore than 40 years ago. \n \nWe are likely therefore to see non-economic individual buyers of newspapers emerge, just as we have seen such buyers acquire major sports franchises.  Aspiring press lords should be careful, however: There’s no rule that says a newspaper’s revenues can’t fall below its expenses and that \nlosses can’t mushroom.  Fixed costs are high in the newspaper business, and that’s bad news when \nunit volume heads south.  As the importance of newspapers diminishes, moreover, the “psychic” value of possessing one will wane, whereas owning a sports franchi se will likely retain its cachet. \n \nUnless we face an irreversible cash drain, we will stick with the News, just as we’ve said that we would.  (Read economic principle 11, on page 76.)   Charlie and I love newspapers – we each read \nfive a day – and believe that a free and energetic press is a key ingredient for maintaining a great democracy.  We hope that some combination of print and online will ward off economic \ndoomsday for newspapers, and we will work hard in Buffalo to develop a sustainable business \nmodel.  I think we will be successful.  But the da ys of lush profits from our newspaper are over. \n 12\n\n• A much improved situation is emerging at NetJets, which sells and manages fractionally-owned \naircraft.  This company has never had a problem growing: Revenues from flight operations have \nincreased 596% since our purchase in 1998.  But profits had been erratic. \n \nOur move to Europe, which began in 1996, was particularly expensive.  After five years of operation there, we had acquired only 80 customers.  And by mid-year 2006 our cumulative pre-\ntax loss had risen to $212 million.  But European demand has now exploded, with a net of 589 customers having been added in 2005-2006.  Under Mark Booth’s brilliant leadership, NetJets is \nnow operating profitably in Europe, and we expect the positive trend to continue. \n \nOur U.S. operation also had a good year in 2006, which led to worldwide pre-tax earnings of $143 \nmillion at NetJets last year.  We made this profit even though we suffered a loss of $19 million in the first quarter. \n \nCredit Rich Santulli, along with Mark, for this turnaround.  Rich, like many of our managers, has no financial need to work.  But you’d never know it.  He’s absolutely tireless – monitoring \noperations, making sales, and traveling the globe to constantly widen the already-enormous lead \nthat NetJets enjoys over its competitors.  Today, the value of the fleet we manage is far greater than that managed by our three largest competitors combined . \n \nThere’s a reason NetJets is the runaway leader: It offers the ultimate in safety and service.  At Berkshire, and at a number of our subsidiaries, NetJ ets aircraft are an indi spensable business tool.  \nI also have a contract for personal use with NetJets and so do members of my family and most Berkshire directors.  (None of us, I should add, gets a discount.)  Once you’ve flown NetJets, returning to commercial flights is like going back to holding hands. \n \nRegulated Utility Business \n \n Berkshire has an 86.6% (fully diluted) interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which owns a wide variety of utility operations.  The largest of thes e are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, \nwhose 3.7 million electric cu stomers make it the third largest distributor of electricity in the U.K.; (2) \nMidAmerican Energy, which serves 70 6,000 electric customers, primaril y in Iowa; (3) Pacific Power and \nRocky Mountain Power, serving about 1.7 million electric customers in six western states; and (4) Kern \nRiver and Northern Natural pipelines, which carry about 8% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S. \n \nOur partners in ownership of MidAmerican are Walter Scott, and its two terrific managers, Dave \nSokol and Greg Abel.  It’s unimportant how many votes each party has; we will make major moves only \nwhen we are unanimous in thinking them wise.  Six years of working with Dave, Greg and Walter have \nunderscored my original belief: Berkshire couldn’t have better partners. \n \n Somewhat incongruously, MidAmerican owns the seco nd largest real estate brokerage firm in the \nU.S., HomeServices of America.  This company operates through 20 locally-branded firms with 20,300 \nagents.  Despite HomeServices’ purchase of two oper ations last year, the company’s overall volume fell \n9% to $58 billion, and profits fell 50%. \n \n The slowdown in residential real estate activity stems in part from the weakened lending practices \nof recent years.  The “optional” contracts and “teaser” rates that have been popular have allowed borrowers to make payments in the early years of their mortgages that fall far short of covering normal interest costs.  \nNaturally, there are few defaults when virtually nothing is required of a borrower.  As a cynic has said, “A \nrolling loan gathers no loss.”  But payments not made add to principal, and borrowers who can’t afford \nnormal monthly payments early on are hit later with above-normal  monthly obligations.  This is the Scarlett \nO’Hara scenario: “I’ll think about that tomorrow.”  For many home owners, “tomorrow” has now arrived.  Consequently there is a huge overhang of offerings in several of HomeServices’ markets. \n \n Nevertheless, we will be seeking to purchase additional brokerage operations.  A decade from \nnow, HomeServices will almost certainly be much larger. \n 13\n\n Here are some key figures on MidAmerican’s operations: \n \n Earnings (in $ millions)\n 2006 2005\nU.K. utilitie s .......................................................................................................  $     338  $     308 \nIowa u tility .........................................................................................................  348 288 \nWestern utilities (acquired Ma rch 21, 2006) .....................................................  356 N/A \nPipelines .............................................................................................................  376 309 \nHomeServices.....................................................................................................  74 148 \nOther (net) ..........................................................................................................        226       115\nEarnings before corporate inte rest and taxes ......................................................  1,718 1,168 \nInterest, other than to Berkshire .........................................................................

When we star ted to wind this business down early in 2002, we had \n23,218 contracts outstanding.  Now we have 197.  Our cumulative pre-tax loss from this operation totals \n$409 million, but only $5 million occurred in 2006.  Charlie says that if we had properly classified the $409 \nmillion on our 2001 balance sheet, it would have been labeled “Good Until Reached For.”  In any event, a \nShakespearean thought – slightly modified – seems appropriate for the tombstone of this derivative \nbusiness: “All’s well that ends.” \n \n We’ve also wound up our investment in Value Capital.  So earnings or losses from these two lines \nof business are making their final appearance in th e table that annually appears in this section. \n \n Clayton Homes remains an anomaly in the manufactured-housing industry, which last year \nrecorded its lowest unit sales since 1962.  Indeed, the industry’s volume last year was only about one-third that of 1999.  Outside of Clayton, I doubt if the industry, overall, made any money in 2006. \n \nYet Clayton earned $513 million pre-tax and paid Berkshire an additional $86 million as a fee for \nour obtaining the funds to finance Clayton’s $10 billi on portfolio of installment receivables.  Berkshire’s \nfinancial strength has clearly been of huge help to Clayton.  But the driving force behind the company’s \nsuccess is Kevin Clayton.  Kevin knows the business forward and backward, is a rational decision-maker and a joy to work with.  Because of acquisitions, Clayton now employs 14,787 people, compared to 6,661 \nat the time of our purchase. \n \n We have two leasing operations: CORT (furniture), run by Paul Arnold, and XTRA (truck trailers), run by Bill Franz.  CORT’s earnings improved  significantly last year, and XTRA’s remained at \nthe high level attained in 2005.  We continue to look for tuck-in acquisitions to be run by Paul or Bill, and \nalso are open to ideas for new leasing opportunities. \n 14\n\n Here’s a breakdown of earnings in this sector: \n (in millions) \nPre-Tax Earnings Interest-Bearing Liabilities\n 2006 2005 2006 2005\nTrading  – ordinary income ............................  $     274 $    200 $    600 $1,061 \nGen Re Securities (loss) .................................

Last year, we told you that our expectation was th at these companies, in aggregate, would increase their earnings by 6% \nto 8% annually, a rate that would double their earnings every ten years or so.  In 2006 American Express,  \n 15\n\nCoca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Wells Fargo, our largest holdings, increased per-share earnings by 18%, \n9%, 8% and 11%.  These are stellar results, and we thank their CEOs. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n We’ve come close to eliminating our direct foreign-exchange position, from which we realized \nabout $186 million in pre-tax profits in 2006 (earnings that were includ ed in the Finance and Financial \nProducts table shown earlier).  That brought our total gain since inception of this position in 2002 to $2.2 \nbillion.  Here’s a br eakdown by currency: \n \nTotal Gain (Loss) in Millions\n    \nAustralian dollar $247.1 Mexican peso $106.1 \nBritish pound 287.2 New Zealand dollar 102.6 \nCanadian dollar 398.3 Singapore dollar (2.6) \nChinese yuan (12.7) South Korean won 261.3 \nEuro 839.2 Swiss franc 9.6 \nHong Kong dollar (2.5) Taiwan dollar (45.3) \nJapanese yen 1.9 Miscellaneous options 22.9 \n \n We’ve made large indirect currency profits as well, though I’ve never tallied the precise amount.  \nFor example, in 2002-2003 we spent about $82 milli on buying – of all things – Enron bonds, some of \nwhich were denominated in Euros.  Already we’ve recei ved distributions of $179 million from these bonds, \nand our remaining stake is worth $173 million.  That means our overall gain is $270 million, part of which came from the appreciation of  the Euro that took pl ace after our bond purchase. \n \n When we first began making foreign exchange pu rchases, interest-rate differentials between the \nU.S. and most foreign countries favored a direct curr ency position.  But that spread turned negative in \n2005.  We therefore looked for other ways to gain foreign-currency exposure, such as the ownership of \nforeign equities or of U.S. stocks with major earning s abroad.  The currency factor, we should emphasize, \nis not dominant in our selection of equities, but is merely one of many considerations. \n \n As our U.S. trade problems worsen, the probability that the dollar will weaken over time continues \nto be high.  I fervently believe in real trade – the more the better for both us and the world.  We had about \n$1.44 trillion of this honest-to-God trade in 20 06.  But the U.S. also had $.76 trillion of pseudo -trade last \nyear – imports for which we exchanged no goods or services.  (Ponder, for a moment, how commentators would describe the situation if our imports were $.76 trillion – a full 6% of GDP – and we had no exports.)  \nMaking these purchases that weren’t r eciprocated by sales, the U.S. nece ssarily transferred ownership of its \nassets or IOUs to the rest of the world.  Like a very  wealthy but self-indulgent fami ly, we peeled off a bit of \nwhat we owned in order to consume more than we produced. \n \nThe U.S. can do a lot of this because we are an  extraordinarily rich country that has behaved \nresponsibly in the past.  The world is therefore w illing to accept our bonds, real estate, stocks and \nbusinesses.  And we have a vast store of these to hand over. \n \n These transfers will have consequences, however.  Already the prediction I made last year about \none fall-out from our spending binge has come true: The “investment income” account of our country – positive in every previous year since 1915  – turned negative in 2006.  Foreigners now earn more on their \nU.S. investments than we do on our investments abroad.  In effect, we’ve used up our bank account and \nturned to our credit card.  And, like everyone who gets in hock, the U.S. will now experience “reverse \ncompounding” as we pay ever-increasing amounts of interest on interest. \n \n I want to emphasize that even though our course is unwise, Americans will live better ten or \ntwenty years from now than they do today.  Per-capita  wealth will increase.  But our citizens will also be \nforced every year to ship a significan t portion of their current production abroad merely to service the cost \nof our huge debtor position.  It won’t be pleasant to work part of each day to pay for the over-consumption  \n 16\n\nof your ancestors.  I believe that at some point in th e future U.S. workers and voters will find this annual \n“tribute” so onerous that there will be a severe political backlash.  How that will play out in markets is \nimpossible to predict – but to expect a “soft landing” seems like wishful thinking. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n I should mention that all of the direct currency profits we have realized have come from forward \ncontracts, which are derivatives, and that we have entere d into other types of derivatives contracts as well.  \nThat may seem odd, since you know of our expensive experience in unwinding the derivatives book at Gen \nRe and also have heard me talk of the systemic problems that could result from the enormous growth in the \nuse of derivatives.  Why, you may wonder, are we fooling around with such potentially toxic material? \n \n The answer is that derivatives, just like stocks and bonds, are sometimes wildly mispriced.  For many years, accordingly, we have selectively written derivative contracts – few in number bu t sometimes \nfor large dollar amounts.  We currently have 62 contracts outstanding.  I manage them personally, and they are free of counterparty credit risk.  So far, thes e derivative contracts have worked out well for us, \nproducing pre-tax profits in the hundreds of millions of dollars (above and beyond the gains I’ve itemized \nfrom forward foreign-exchange contracts).  Though we will experience losses from time to time, we are \nlikely to continue to earn – overall – significant profits from mispriced derivatives. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n I have told you that Berkshir e has three outstanding candidates to replace me as CEO and that the \nBoard knows exactly who should take over if I should die tonight.  Each of the three is much younger than I.  The directors believe it’s important that my successor have the prospect of a long tenure. \n \n Frankly, we are not as well-prepared on the investment side of our business.  There’s a history here: At one time, Charlie was my potential replacemen t for investing, and more recently Lou Simpson has \nfilled that slot.  Lou is a top-notch investor with an outstanding long-term record of managing GEICO’s \nequity portfolio.  But he is only six years younger than I.  If I were to die soon, he would fill in magnificently for a short period.  For the long-term, though, we need a different answer. \n \n At our October board meeting, we discussed that subject fully.  And we emerged with a plan, which I will carry out with the help of Charlie and Lou. \n \n Under this plan, I intend to hire a younger man or woman with the potential to manage a very \nlarge portfolio, who we hope will succeed me as Berksh ire’s chief investment officer when the need for \nsomeone to do that arises.  As part of the selection process, we may in fact take on several candidates. \n \n Picking the right person(s) will not be an easy task .  It’s not hard, of course, to find smart people, \namong them individuals who have impressive investment records.  But there is far more to successful long-\nterm investing than brains and performance that has recently been good.   \n \nOver time, markets will do extraordinary, even bizarre, things.  A single, big mistake could wipe \nout a long string of successes.  We therefore need so meone genetically programmed  to recognize and avoid \nserious risks, including those never before encountered .  Certain perils that lurk in investment strategies \ncannot be spotted by use of the models commonly employed today by financial institutions. \n \nTemperament is also important.  Independent thinking, emotional stability, and a keen \nunderstanding of both human and ins titutional behavior is vital to long-t erm investment success.  I’ve seen \na lot of very smart people who have lacked these virtues. \n \n Finally, we have a special problem to consider: our ability to keep the person we hire.  Being able to list Berkshire on a resume would materially enhance the marketability of an investment manager.  We \nwill need, therefore, to be sure we can retain our choi ce, even though he or she could leave and make much \nmore money elsewhere. \n 17\n\nThere are surely people who fit what we need, but they may be hard to identify.  In 1979, Jack \nByrne and I felt we had found such a person in Lou Simpson.  We then made an arrangement with him \nwhereby he would be paid well for sustained overperformance.  Under this deal, he has earned large \namounts.  Lou, however, could have left us long ago to manage far greater sums on more advantageous terms.  If money alone had been the object, that’s exactly what he would have done.  But Lou never \nconsidered such a move.  We need to find a younger person or two made of the same stuff.   \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n The good news: At 76, I feel terrific and, accordin g to all measurable indicators, am in excellent \nhealth.  It’s amazing what Cherry Coke and hamburgers will do for a fellow. \n \nSome Changes on Berkshire’s Board \n \n The composition of our board will change in two ways this spring.  One change will involve the \nChace family, which has been connected to Berkshir e and its predecessor companies for more than a \ncentury.  In 1929, the first Malcolm G. Chace played  an important role in merging four New England \ntextile operations into Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates.  That company merged with Hathaway Manufacturing in 1955 to  form Berkshire Hathaway, and Malcol m G. Chace, Jr. became its chairman. \n \n Early in 1965, Malcolm arranged for Buffett Partnership Ltd. to buy a key block of Berkshire shares and welcomed us as the new controlling shareholder of the company.  Malcolm continued as non-executive chairman until 1969.  He was both a wonderful gentleman and helpful partner. \n \n That description also fits his son, Malcolm “K im” Chace, who succeeded his father on Berkshire’s \nboard in 1992.  But last year Kim, now actively and successfully running a community bank that he \nfounded in 1996, suggest ed that we find a younger person to replace him on our board.   We have done so, \nand Kim will step down as a director at the annual m eeting.  I owe much to the Chaces and wish to thank \nKim for his many years of service to Berkshire. \n \n In selecting a new director, we were guided by our long-standing criteria, which are that board members be owner-oriented, business-savvy, interested and truly independent.  I say “truly” because many \ndirectors who are now deemed independent by various authorities and observers are far from that, relying \nheavily as they do on directors’ fees to maintain their standard of living.  These payments, which come in many forms, often range between $150,000 and $250,000 annually, compensation that may approach or \neven exceed all other income of the “independent” director.  And – surprise, surprise – director compensation has soared in recent years, pushed up by recommendations from corporate America’s \nfavorite consultant, Ratchet, Ratchet and Bingo.  (The name may be phony, but the action it conveys is not.) \n \nCharlie and I believe our four criteria are essential if  directors are to do their job – which, by law, \nis to faithfully represent owners .  Yet these criteria are usually ignored.  Instead, consultants and CEOs \nseeking board candidates will often say, “We’re looking  for a woman,” or “a Hispanic,” or “someone from \nabroad,” or what have you.  It sometimes sounds as if the mission is to stock Noah’s ark.  Over the years I’ve been queried many times about potential directors and have yet to hear anyone  ask, “Does he think like \nan intelligent owner?”   \n \n The questions I instead get would sound ridiculous to someone seeking candidates for, say, a football team, or an arbitration panel or a military co mmand.  In those cases, the selectors would look for \npeople who had the specific talents and attitudes that were  required for a specialized job.  At Berkshire, we \nare in the specialized activ ity of running a business well, and therefore we seek business  judgment. \n \n That’s exactly what we’ve found in Susan Decker , CFO of Yahoo!, who will join our board at the \nannual meeting.  We are lucky to have her: She scores very high on our four criteria and additionally, at 44, \nis young – an attribute, as you may have noticed, that your Chairman has long lacked.  We will seek more \nyoung directors in the future, but never by slighting the four qualities that we insist upon. \n 18\n\nThis and That \n \n Berkshire will pay about $4.4 billion in federal inco me tax on its 2006 earnings.  In its last fiscal \nyear the U.S. Government spent $2.6 trillion, or about $7 billion per day.  Thus, for more than half of one \nday, Berkshire picked up the tab for all federal expenditures, ranging from  Social Security and Medicare \npayments to the cost of our armed se rvices.  Had there been only 600 taxpayers like Berkshire, no one else \nin America would have needed to pay any federal income or payroll taxes. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Our federal return last year, we should add, ran to 9,386 pages.  To handle this filing, state and \nforeign tax returns, a myriad of SEC requirements, and all of the other matters involved in running \nBerkshire, we have gone all the way up to 19 employees at World Headquarters. \n \n This crew occupies 9,708 square feet of space, and Charlie – at World Headquarters West in Los \nAngeles – uses another 655 square feet.  Our home-office payroll, including benefits and counting both \nlocations, totaled $3,531,978 last year.  We’re careful when spending your money. \n \n Corporate bigwigs often complain about govern ment spending, criticizing bureaucrats who they \nsay spend taxpayers’ money differently from how they  would if it were their own.  But sometimes the \nfinancial behavior of executives will also vary based on whose wallet is getting depleted.  Here’s an illustrative tale from my days at Salomon.  In the 1980s the company had a barber, Jimmy by name, who came in weekly to give free haircuts to the top brass.  A manicurist was also on tap.  Then, because of a \ncost-cutting drive, patrons were told to pay their own way.  One top executive (not the CEO) who had \npreviously visited Jimmy weekly went immedi ately to a once-every-three-weeks schedule. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nEvery now and then Charlie and I catch on early to a tide-like trend, one brimming over with \ncommercial promise.  For example,  though American Airlines (with its “miles”) and American Express \n(with credit card points) ar e credited as being trailbl azers in granting customers “rewards,” Charlie and I \nwere far ahead of them in spotting the appeal of this powerful idea.  Excited by our insight, the two of us jumped into the reward business way back in 1970 by buying control of a trading stamp operation, Blue \nChip Stamps.  In that year, Blue Chip had sales of $126 million, and its stamps papered California. \n \nIn 1970, indeed, about 60 billion  of our stamps were licked by savers, pasted into books, and taken \nto Blue Chip redemption stores.  Our catalog of rewards was 116 pages thick and chock full of tantalizing \nitems.  When I was told that even certain brothels and mortuaries gave stamps to their patrons, I felt I had \nfinally found a sure thing. \n \nWell, not quite.  From the day Charlie and I stepped into the Blue Chip picture, the business went \nstraight downhill.  By 1980, sales had fallen to $19.4 million.  And, by 1990, sales were bumping along at \n$1.5 million.  No quitter, I redoubled my managerial efforts. \n \n Sales then fell another 98%.  Last year, in Berkshire’s $98 billion of revenues, all of $25,920 ( no \nzeros omitted) came from Blue Chip.  Ever hopeful, Charlie and I soldier on. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n I mentioned last year that in my service on 19 corporate boards (not counting Berkshire or other \ncontrolled companies), I have been the Typhoid Mary of compensation committees.  At only one company \nwas I assigned to comp committee duty, and then I was promptly outvoted on the most crucial decision that \nwe faced.  My ostracism has been peculiar, consideri ng that I certainly haven’t lacked experience in setting \nCEO pay.  At Berkshire, after all, I am a one-man  compensation committee who determines the salaries \nand incentives for the CEOs of around 40 significant operating businesses. \n 19\n\n How much time does this aspect of my job take?  Virtually none.  How many CEOs have \nvoluntarily left us for other jobs in our 42-year history?  Precisely none. \n \n Berkshire employs many different incentive arrangements, with their terms depending on such elements as the economic potential or capital intensity of a CEO’s busi ness.  Whatever the compensation \narrangement, though, I try to keep it both simple and fair. \n \nWhen we use incentives – and these can be large – they are always tied to the operating results for \nwhich a given CEO has authority.  We issue no lottery tickets that carry payoffs unrelated to business performance.  If a CEO bats .300, he gets paid for being a .300 hitter, even if circumstances outside of his control cause Berkshire to perform poo rly.  And if he bats .150, he do esn’t get a payoff just because the \nsuccesses of others have enabled Berkshire to prosper mightily.  An example:  We now own $61 billion of equities at Berkshire, whose value can easily rise or fall by 10% in a given year.  Why in the world should \nthe pay of our operating executives be affected by such $6 billion swings, however important the gain or \nloss may be for shareholders? \n \n You’ve read loads about CE Os who have received astronomical compensation for mediocre \nresults.  Much less well-advertised is the fact that Am erica’s CEOs also generally live the good life.  Many, \nit should be emphasized, are exceptiona lly able, and almost all work far more than 40 hours a week.  But \nthey are usually treated like royalty in the process.  (And we’re certainly going to keep it that way at \nBerkshire.  Though Charlie still favors sackcloth and as hes, I prefer to be spoile d rotten.  Berkshire owns \nThe Pampered Chef; our wond erful office group has made me The Pampered Chief.) \n \n CEO perks at one company are quickly copied else where.  “All the other kids have one” may seem \na thought too juvenile to use as a rationale in the boardroom.  But consultants employ precisely this \nargument, phrased more elegantly of course, when they make recommendations to comp committees. \n \n Irrational and excessive comp practices will not be materially changed by disclosure or by “independent” comp committee members.  Indeed, I th ink it’s likely that the reason I was rejected for \nservice on so many comp committees was that I was regarded as too independent.  Compensation reform \nwill only occur if the largest institutional shareh olders – it would only take a few – demand a fresh look at \nthe whole system.  The consultants’ present drill of def tly selecting “peer” companies to compare with their \nclients will only perpetuate present excesses. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Last year I arranged for the bulk of my Berkshire holdings to go to five charitable foundations, thus carrying out part of my lifelong plan to eventually use all of my shares for philanthropic purposes.  \nDetails of the commitments I made, as well as the rationale for them, are posted on our website, \nwww.berkshirehathaway.com .  Taxes, I should note, had nothing to do with my decision or its timing.  My \nfederal and state income taxes in 2006 were exactly what they would have been had I not made my first contributions last summer, and the same point will apply to my 2007 contributions. \n \n In my will I’ve stipulated that the proceeds from all Berkshire shares I still own at death are to be \nused for philanthropic pur poses within ten years after my estate is closed.  Because my affairs are not \ncomplicated, it should take th ree years at most for this closing to occur.  Adding this 13-year period to my \nexpected lifespan of about 12 years (though, naturally, I’m aiming for more) means that proceeds from all \nof my Berkshire shares will likely be distributed for societal purposes over the next 25 years or so. \n \nI’ve set this schedule because I want the money to be spent relatively promptly by people I know  \nto be capable, vigorous and motivated.  These managerial attributes sometimes wane as institutions – particularly those that are exempt fro m market forces – age.  Today, ther e are terrific people in charge at \nthe five foundations.  So at my death, why should they not move with dispatch to judiciously spend the money that remains? \n 20\n\nThose people favoring perpetual foundations argue that in the future there will most certainly be \nlarge and important societal problems that philanthropy will need to address.  I agree.  But there will then \nalso be many super-rich individuals and families wh ose wealth will exceed that of today’s Americans and \nto whom philanthropic organizations can make their case for funding.  These funders can then judge \nfirsthand which operations have both the vitality and the focus to best address the major societal problems \nthat then exist.  In this way, a market test of ideas an d effectiveness can be applied.  Some organizations \nwill deserve major support while othe rs will have outlived their usefulness.  Even if the people above \nground make their decisions imperfectly, they should be able to allocate funds more rationally than a decedent six feet under will have ordained decades earlie r.  Wills, of course, can always be rewritten, but \nit’s very unlikely that my thinking will change in a material way. \n \n A few shareholders have expressed concern that sales of Berkshire by the foundations receiving \nshares will depress the stock.  These fears are unwarra nted.  The annual trading volume of many stocks \nexceeds 100% of the outstanding shares, but nevertheless these stocks usually sell at prices approximating \ntheir intrinsic value.  Berkshire also tends to sell at an appropriate price, but with a nnual volume that is only \n15% of shares outstanding.  At most, sales by the foundations receiving my shares will add three percentage points to annual trading volume, which will s till leave Berkshire with a turnover ratio that is the \nlowest around. \n \nOverall, Berkshire’s business performance will dete rmine the price of our stock, and most of the \ntime it will sell in a zone of reasonableness.  It’s important that the foundations receive appropriate prices \nas they periodically sell Berkshire shares, but it’s also  important that incoming shareholders don’t overpay.  \n(See economic principle 14 on page 77.)  By both our policies and shareholder communications, Charlie and I will do our best to ensure that Berkshire sells at neither a large discount nor large premium to intrinsic value. \n \n The existence of foundation ownership will in no way influence our board’s decisions about dividends, repurchases, or the issuance of shares.  We will follow exactly the same rule that has guided us \nin the past: What action will be likely to deliver the best result for shareholders over time? \n* * * * * * * * * * * * * \n In last year’s report I allegorically described the Gotrocks family – a clan that owned all of America’s businesses and that counterproductively attempted to increase its investment returns by paying \never-greater commissions and fees to “helpers.”  Sa d to say, the “family” continued its self-destructive \nways in 2006. \n \n In part the family persists in this folly because it harbors unrealistic expectations about obtainable \nreturns.  Sometimes these delusions are self-serving.  For example, private pension plans can temporarily \noverstate their earnings, and public pension plans can defer the need for increased taxes, by using \ninvestment assumptions that are likely to be out of reach.  Actuaries and auditors go along with these \ntactics, and it can be decades before the chickens come home to roost (at which point the CEO or public official who misled the world is apt to be gone). \n \n Meanwhile, Wall Street’s Pied Pipers of Performa nce will have encouraged the futile hopes of the \nfamily. The hapless Gotrocks will be assured that they all can achieve above-average investment \nperformance – but only by paying ever-higher fees.  Call this promise the adult version of Lake Woebegon. \n \nIn 2006, promises and fees hit new highs.  A flood of money went from institutional investors to \nthe 2-and-20 crowd.  For those innocent of this arrangement, let me explain: It’s a lopsided system whereby 2% of your principal  is paid each year to the manager even if he accomplishes nothing – or, for that matter, \nloses you a bundle – and, additionally, 20% of your profit is paid to him if he succeeds, even if his success \nis due simply to a rising tide.  For example, a manage r who achieves a gross return of 10% in a year will \nkeep 3.6 percentage points – two points off the top plus 20% of the residual 8 points – leaving only 6.4 \npercentage points for his investors.  On a $3 billi on fund, this 6.4% net “p erformance” will deliver the \nmanager a cool $108 million.  He will receive this bona nza even though an index fund might have returned \n15% to investors in the same period and charged them only a token fee. \n 21\n\nThe inexorable math of this grotesque arrangemen t is certain to make the Gotrocks family poorer \nover time than it would have been had it never heard of these “hyper-helpers.”  Even so, the 2-and-20 \naction spreads.  Its effects bring to mind the old adage: When someone with experience proposes a deal to \nsomeone with money, too often the fellow with money ends up with the experience, and the fellow with \nexperience ends up with the money. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Let me end this section by telling you about one of the good guys of Wall Street, my long-time \nfriend Walter Schloss, who last year turned 90.  From 1956 to 2002, Walter managed a remarkably \nsuccessful investment partnership, from which he took not a dime unle ss his investors made money.  My \nadmiration for Walter, it should be noted, is not based on hindsight.  A full fifty years ago, Walter was my \nsole recommendation to a St. Louis family who wanted an honest and able investment manager. \n \n Walter did not go to business school, or for that matter, college.  His office contained one file \ncabinet in 1956; the number mushroom ed to four by 2002.  Walter work ed without a secretary, clerk or \nbookkeeper, his only associate being his son, Edwin, a graduate of the North Carolina School of the Arts.  \nWalter and Edwin never came within a mile of inside in formation.  Indeed, they used “outside” information \nonly sparingly, generally selecting securities by certa in simple statistical methods Walter learned while \nworking for Ben Graham.  When Walter and Edwin were asked in 1989 by Outstanding Investors Digest , \n“How would you summarize your approach?” Edwin replied, “We try to buy stocks cheap.”  So much for \nModern Portfolio Theory, technical analysis, macroeconomic thoughts and complex algorithms. \n \n Following a strategy that involved no real risk – defined as permanent loss of capital – Walter produced results over his 47 partnership years that dramatically surpassed those of the S&P 500.  It’s particularly noteworthy that he built this record by investing in about 1,000 securities, mostly of a \nlackluster type.  A few big winners did not account for his success.  It’s safe to say that had millions of \ninvestment managers made trades by a) drawing stock names from a hat; b) purchasing these stocks in \ncomparable amounts when Walter made a purchase; a nd then c) selling when Walter sold his pick, the \nluckiest of them would not have come close to equaling his record.  There is simply no possibility that what \nWalter achieved over 47 years was due to chance. \n \n I first publicly discussed Walter’s remarkable record in 1984.  At that time “efficient market theory” (EMT) was the centerpiece of investment instru ction at most major business schools.  This theory, \nas then most commonly taught, held that the price of any stock at any moment is not demonstrably mispriced, which means that no investor can be expected  to overperform the stock market averages using \nonly publicly-available information (though some will do so by luck).  When I talked about Walter 23 years \nago, his record forcefully contradicted this dogma. \n \nAnd what did members of the academic community do when they were exposed to this new and \nimportant evidence?  Unfortunately, they reacted in all-too-human fashion: Ra ther than opening their \nminds, they closed their eyes.  To my knowledge no business school teaching EMT made any attempt to \nstudy Walter’s performance and what it meant for the school’s cherished theory.    \n \n Instead, the faculties of the schools went me rrily on their way presenting EMT as having the \ncertainty of scripture.  Typically, a finance instructor who had the nerve to question EMT had about as much chance of major promotion as Galileo had of being named Pope. \n \n Tens of thousands of students were therefore sent out into life believing that on every day the price of every stock was “right” (or, more accurately, not de monstrably wrong) and that attempts to evaluate \nbusinesses – that is, stocks – were useless.  Walter meanwhile went on overperforming, his job made easier \nby the misguided instructions that had been given to those young minds.  After all, if you are in the shipping business, it’s helpful to have all of your pot ential competitors be taught that the earth is flat. \n \n Maybe it was a good thing for his investors that Walter didn’t go to college. \n 22\n\nThe Annual Meeting  \n \n Our meeting this year will be held on Saturday, May 5th.   As always, the doors will open at the \nQwest Center at 7 a.m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at 8:30.  At 9:30 we will go directly to \nthe question-and-answer period, whic h (with a break for lunch at the Qwest’s stands) will last until 3:00.  \nThen, after a short recess, Charlie an d I will convene the annual meeting at  3:15.  If you decide to leave \nduring the day’s question periods, please do so while Charlie  is talking. \n \n The best reason to exit, of course is to shop .  We will help you do that by filling the 194,300 \nsquare foot hall that adjoins the m eeting area with the products of Berk shire subsidiaries.  Last year, the \n24,000 people who came to the meeting did their part, a nd almost every location rack ed up record sales.  \nBut records are made to be broken, and I know you can do better. \n \n This year we will again showcase a Clayton ho me (featuring Acme brick, Shaw carpet, Johns \nManville insulation, MiTek fasteners, Carefree awning s and NFM furniture).  You will find that the home, \npriced at $139,900, delivers excellent value.  Last y ear, a helper at the Qwest bought one of two homes on \ndisplay well before we opened the doors to shareholders.  Flanking the Clayton home on the exhibition floor this year will be an RV and pontoon boat from Forest River. \n \n GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of \nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes.  In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a special shareholder discount (usually 8% ).  This special offer is permitted by 45 of the 50 jurisdictions in \nwhich we operate.  (One supplemental point: The discount  is not additive if you qualify for another, such as \nthat given certain groups.)  Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money.  For at least 50% of you, I believe we can.  And while you’re at it, sign up for the new GEICO \ncredit card.  It’s the one I now use (sparingly, of course). \n \n On Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets available for your inspection.  Stop by the NetJets booth at the Qwest to learn about viewing these planes.  Come to \nOmaha by bus; leave in your new plane.  And take all the hair gel that you wish on board with you. \n \n In the Bookworm’s corner of our bazaar, there will be about 25 books and DVDs – all discounted \n– led again by Poor Charlie’s Almanack.  (One hapless soul last year asked Charlie what he should do if he \ndidn’t enjoy the book.  Back came a Mungerism: “No pr oblem – just give it to someone more intelligent.”)  \nWe’ve added a few titles this year.  Among them are Seeking Wisdom: From Darwin to Munger  by Peter \nBevelin, a long-time Swedish shareholder of Berkshire, and Fred Schwed’s classic, Where are the \nCustomers’ Yachts?   This book was first published in 1940 and is now in its 4th edition.  The funniest book \never written about investing, it lightly delivers many truly important messages on the subject. \n \n An attachment to the proxy material that is encl osed with this report explains how you can obtain \nthe credential you will need for admission to the meeti ng and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car \nreservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  Carol \nPedersen, who handles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it.  Hotel \nrooms can be hard to find, but work with Carol and you will get one. \n \n At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, \nwe will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing.  We initiated this special event at NFM ten \nyears ago, and sales during the “Weekend” grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $30 million in 2006.  I get \ngoose bumps just thinking about this volume. \n \n To obtain the Berkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, May 3rd and \nMonday, May 7th inclusive, and also present your meeting cr edential.  The period’s special pricing will \neven apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you.  We \nappreciate their cooperation.  NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m.  \n 23\n\nto 6 p.m. on Sunday.  On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a special shareholder \npicnic featuring chicken and beef tacos (and hamburgers for traditionalists like me). \n \n At a remodeled and expanded Borsheim’s, we will again have two shareholder-only events.  The first will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, May 4\nth.  The second, the main gala, will \nbe held on Sunday, May 6th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.  On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. \n \n We will have huge crowds at Borsheim’s throughout the weekend.  For your convenience, \ntherefore, shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 30th through Saturday, May 12th.  \nDuring that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder by pres enting your meeting credentials or a \nbrokerage statement that show s you are a Berkshire holder. \n \n On Sunday, in a tent outside of Borsheim’s, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, will take on all comers – who will have their eyes wide open – in groups of six.  Last year I \ncarried on a conversation with Patrick while he pl ayed in this manner.  Nearby, Norman Beck, a \nremarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers.  Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and \nSharon Osberg, two of the world’s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on \nSunday afternoon. \n \n To add to the Sunday fun at Borsheim’s, Ariel Hsing will play table tennis (ping-pong to the uninitiated) from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. against anyone brave enough to take her on.  Ariel, though only 11, is ranked number one among girls under 16 in the U.S. (and number 1 among both boys and girls under 12).  \nThe week I turned 75 I played Ariel, then 9 and barely tall enough to see across the table, thinking I would \ntake it easy on her so as not to crush her young spirit.  Instead she crushed me.  I’ve since devised a plan that will give me a chance against her.  At 1 p.m. on Sunday, I will initiate play with a 2-point  game against \nAriel.  If I somehow win the first point, I will then fe ign injury and claim victory.  After this strenuous \nencounter wears Ariel down, our shareholders  can then try their luck against her. \n \n Gorat’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 6th, and will be \nserving from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  Please remember that  to come to Gorat’s on that day, you must have a \nreservation.  To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 1st (but not before ).   \n \n In the 2006-2007 school year, 35 university classes, including one from IBMEC in Brazil, will \ncome to Omaha for sessions with me.  I take almost all – in aggregate, more than 2,000 students – to lunch \nat Gorat’s.  And they love it.  To learn why, come join us on Sunday. \n \n We will again have a reception at 4 p.m. on Satu rday afternoon fo r shareholders who have come \nfrom outside of North America.  Every year our meeting draws many people from around the globe, and Charlie and I want to be sure we personally greet those who have come so far.  Last year we enjoyed \nmeeting more than 400 of you from many dozens of countries.  Any shareholder who comes from other \nthan the U.S. or Canada will be given a special cred ential and instructions for attending this function. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Charlie and I are extraordinarily lucky.  We we re born in America; had terrific parents who saw \nthat we got good educations; have enjoyed wonderful families and great health; and came equipped with a \n“business” gene that allows us to prosper in a manner hugely disproportionate to other people who contribute as much or more to our society’s well-being.   Moreover, we have long had jobs that we love, in \nwhich we are helped every day in countless ways by ta lented and cheerful associ ates.  No wonder we tap-\ndance to work.  But nothing is more fun for us than getting together with our shareholder-partners at Berkshire’s annual meeting.  So join us on May 5\nth at the Qwest for our annual Woodstock for Capitalists.  \nWe’ll see you there. \n \nFebruary 28, 2007    Warren E. Buffett \n      Chairman of the Board \n 24",

In this table, Berkshire’s results \nthrough 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rule s.  In all other respects, the results are calculated using \nthe numbers originally reported. \nThe S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax  whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax .  If a corporation such as Berkshire \nwere simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appr opriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500 \nin years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index \nshowed a negative return.  Over the years, the tax cost s would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.  \n\n \nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. \n \n \nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hath away Inc.: \n \nOur gain in net worth during 2007 was $12.3 billion, which increased the per-share book value of \nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 11%.  Over the last 43 years (that is, since present management took \nover) book value has grown from $19 to $78,008, a rate of 21.1% compounded annually.* \n \nOverall, our 76 operating businesses did well last y ear.  The few that had problems were primarily \nthose linked to housing, among them our brick, carpet and real estate brokerage operations.  Their setbacks \nare minor and temporary.  Our competitive position in these businesses remains strong, and we have first-\nclass CEOs who run them right, in good times or bad. \n \nSome major financial institutions have, however, experienced staggering problems because they \nengaged in the “weakened lending practices” I described in last year’s letter.  John Stumpf, CEO of Wells \nFargo, aptly dissected the recent behavior of many lenders: “It is interesting that the industry has invented new ways to lose money when the old ways seemed to work just fine.” \n \nYou may recall a 2003 Silicon Valley bumper sticker that implored, “Please, God, Just One More \nBubble.”  Unfortunately, this wish was promptly granted, as just about all Americans came to believe that \nhouse prices would forever rise.  That convictio n made a borrower’s income  and cash equity seem \nunimportant to lenders, who shoveled out money, confident that HPA – house price appreciation – would \ncure all problems.  Today, our country is experiencing widespread pain because of  that erroneous belief.  \nAs house prices fall, a huge amount of financial folly is being exposed.  You only learn who has been swimming naked when the tide goes out – and what we are witnessing at some of our largest financial institutions is an ugly sight. \n \n Turning to happier thoughts, we can report that Berkshire’s newest acquisitions of size, TTI and Iscar, led by their CEOs, Paul Andrews and Jacob Harpaz respectively, performed magnificently in 2007.  \nIscar is as impressive a manufacturing operation as I’ ve seen, a view I reported  last year and that was \nconfirmed by a visit I made in the fall to its extraordinary plant in Korea. \n \n Finally, our insurance business – the cornerstone of Berkshire – had an excellent year.  Part of the \nreason is that we have the best collection of insurance managers in the business – more about them later.  \nBut we also were very lucky in 2007, the second year in a row free of major insured catastrophes. \n \n That party is over.  It’s a certainty  that insurance-industry profit margins, including ours, will fall \nsignificantly in 2008.  Prices are down, and exposures inexorably rise.  Even if the U.S. has its third \nconsecutive catastrophe-light year, industry profit marg ins will probably shrink by four percentage points \nor so.  If the winds roar or the earth trembles, results could be far worse.  So be prepared for lower \ninsurance earnings during the next few years. \n \nYardsticks \n \n Berkshire has two major areas of value.  The first is our investments: stocks, bonds and cash equivalents.  At yearend these totaled $141 billion (not counting those in our finance or utility operations, \nwhich we assign to our second bucket of value). \n \n  \n * All per-share figures used in this report apply to  Berkshire’s A shares.  Figures for the B shares \nare 1/30th of those shown for the A. \n 3\n\n Insurance float – money we temporarily hold in our insurance operations that does not belong to \nus – funds $59 billion of our investments.  This fl oat is “free” as long as insurance underwriting breaks \neven, meaning that the premiums we receive equal the losses and expenses we incur.  Of course, insurance \nunderwriting is volatile, swinging erratically between profits and losses.  Over our entire history, however, we’ve been profitable, and I expect we will average breake ven results or better in the future.  If we do that, \nour investments can be viewed as an unencumber ed source of value for Berkshire shareholders. \n \n Berkshire’s second component of value is earnings that come from sources other than investments \nand insurance.  These earnings are delivered by our 66 non-insurance companies, itemized on page 76.  In \nour early years, we focused on the investment side.  During the past two decades, however, we have put \never more emphasis on the development of earnings from non-insurance businesses. \n \n The following tables illustrate this shift.  In th e first we tabulate per-share investments at 14-year \nintervals.  We exclude those applicable to minority interests. \n \n \nYearPer-Share \nInvestments \nYearsCompounded Annual \nGain in Per-Share Investments\n    \n1965 $         4   \n1979 577 1965-1979 42.8% \n1993 13,961 1979-1993 25.6% \n2007 90,343 1993-2007 14.3% \n \n For the entire 42 years, our compounded annual gain in per-share investments was 27.1%.  But the \ntrend has been downward as we increasingly used our available funds to buy operating businesses. \n \n Here’s the record on how earnings of our non-insurance businesses have grown, again on a per-share basis and after applicable minority interests. \n \n \nYearPer Share \nPre-Tax Earnings \nYearsCompounded Annual Gain in Per-\nShare Pre-Tax Earnings\n    \n1965 $      4   \n1979 18 1965-1979 11.1% \n1993 212 1979-1993 19.1% \n2007 4,093 1993-2007 23.5% \n \n For the entire period, the compounded annual gain was 17.8%, with gains accelerating as our focus shifted. \n \n Though these tables may help you gain historical perspective and be useful in valuation, they are completely misleading in predicting future possibilities.  Berkshire’s past record can’t be duplicated or \neven approached.  Our base of  assets and earnings is now far too la rge for us to make outsized gains in the \nfuture.  \n \n Charlie Munger, my partner at Berkshire, and I will continue to measure our progress by the two \nyardsticks I have just described and will regularly update you on the results.  Though we can’t come close to duplicating the past, we will do our best to make sure the future is not disappointing. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n In our efforts, we will be aided enormously by th e managers who have joined Berkshire.  This is \nan unusual group in several ways.  First, most of them have no financial need to work.  Many sold us their \nbusinesses for large sums and run th em because they love doing so, not because they need the money.  \nNaturally they wish to be paid fairly, but money alon e is not the reason they work hard and productively. \n 4\n\n A second, somewhat related, point about these managers is that they have exactly the job they \nwant for the rest of their working years.  At almost any other company, key managers below the top aspire \nto keep climbing the pyramid.  For them, the subsidiary or division they manage today is a way station – or \nso they hope.  Indeed, if they are in their present positions five years from now, they may well feel like \nfailures. \n \n Conversely, our CEOs’ scorecards for success are not whether they obtain my job but instead are \nthe long-term performances of their businesses.  Their decisions flow from a here-today, here-forever \nmindset.  I think our rare and hard-to-replicate managerial structure gives Berkshire a real advantage. \n \nAcquisitions \n \n Though our managers may be the best, we will need large and sensible acquisitions to get the \ngrowth in operating earnings we wish.  Here, we made little progress in 2007 until very late in the year.  \nThen, on Christmas day, Charlie and I finally earne d our paychecks by contracting for the largest cash \npurchase in Berkshire’s history. \n \n The seeds of this transaction were planted in 1954.  That fall, only three months into a new job, I was sent by my employers, Ben Graham and Jerry Newman, to a shareholders’ meeting of Rockwood \nChocolate in Brooklyn.  A young fellow had recently taken control of this company, a manufacturer of \nassorted cocoa-based items.  He had then initiated a one-of-a-kind tender, offering 80 pounds of cocoa beans for each share of Rockwood stock.  I described this  transaction in a section of the 1988 annual report \nthat explained arbitrage.  I also told you that Jay Pritzker – the young fellow mentioned above – was the business genius behind this tax-efficient idea, the possibilities for which had escaped all the other experts who had thought about buying Rockwood, including my bosses, Ben and Jerry. \n \n At the meeting, Jay was friendly and gave me an  education on the 1954 tax code.  I came away \nvery impressed.  Thereafter, I avid ly followed Jay’s business dealings, which were many and brilliant.  His \nvalued partner was his brother, Bob, who for nearly 50 years ran Marmon Group, the home for most of the Pritzker businesses. \n \n Jay died in 1999, and Bob retired early in 2002.  Around then, the Pritzker family decided to gradually sell or reorganize certain of its holdings, including Marmon, a company operating 125 \nbusinesses, managed through nine sectors.  Marmon’s largest operation is Union Tank Car, which together \nwith a Canadian counterpart owns 94,000 rail cars that are leased to various shippe rs.  The original cost of \nthis fleet is $5.1 billion.  All told, Marmon has $7 billion in sales and about 20,000 employees. \n \n We will soon purchase 60% of Marmon and will acq uire virtually all of the balance within six \nyears.  Our initial outlay will be $4.5 billion, and the price of our later purchases will be based on a formula \ntied to earnings.  Prior to our entry into the picture, the Pritzker family received substantial consideration \nfrom Marmon’s distribution of cash, investments and certain businesses. \n \n This deal was done in the way Jay would have liked.  We arrived at a price using only Marmon’s \nfinancial statements, employing no advisors and engaging in no nit-picking.  I knew that the business would be exactly as the Pritzkers represented, and they knew that we would cl ose on the dot, however \nchaotic financial markets might be.  During the past year, many large deals have been renegotiated or killed entirely.  With the Pritzkers, as w ith Berkshire, a deal is a deal.  \n \n Marmon’s CEO, Frank Ptak, works closely with a long-time associate, John  Nichols.  John was \nformerly the highly successful CEO of  Illinois Tool Works (I TW), where he teamed with Frank to run a \nmix of industrial businesses.  Take a look at their ITW record; you’ll be impressed. \n 5\n\n Byron Trott of Goldman Sachs – whose praises I sa ng in the 2003 report – facilitated the Marmon \ntransaction.  Byron is the rare investment banker who puts himself in his client’s shoes.  Charlie and I trust \nhim completely. \n \n You’ll like the code name that Goldman Sachs assigned the deal.  Marmon entered the auto \nbusiness in 1902 and exited it in 1933.  Along the way it manufactured the Wasp, a car that won the first \nIndianapolis 500 race, held in 1911.  So this deal was labeled “Indy 500.” \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n In May 2006, I spoke at a lunch at Ben Bridge, our Seattle-based jewelry chain.  The audience was \na number of its vendors, among them Dennis Ulrich , owner of a company that manufactured gold jewelry. \n \n In January 2007, Dennis called me, suggesting that with Berkshire’s support he could build a large \njewelry supplier.  We soon made a deal for his business, simultaneously purchasing a supplier of about equal size.  The new company, Richline Group, has since made two smaller acquisitions.  Even with those, Richline is far below the earnings threshold we norm ally require for purchases.  I’m willing to bet, \nhowever, that Dennis – with the help of his partner, Dave Meleski – will build a large operation, earning good returns on capital employed. \n \nBusinesses – The Great, th e Good and the Gruesome \n \n Let’s take a look at what kind of businesses turn us on.  And while we’re at it, let’s also discuss \nwhat we wish to avoid. \n \n Charlie and I look for companies that have a) a business we understand; b) favorable long-term economics; c) able and trustworthy management; and d) a sensible price tag.  We like to buy the whole \nbusiness or, if management is our partner, at least 80%.  When control-type purchases of quality aren’t \navailable, though, we are also happy to simply buy small portions of great businesses by way of stock-\nmarket purchases.  It’s better to have a part interest in the Hope Diamond than to own all of a rhinestone. \n \n A truly great business must have an enduring “moat” that protects excellent returns on invested capital.  The dynamics of capitalism guarantee that competitors will repeatedly assault any business \n“castle” that is earning high  returns.  Therefore a formidable barr ier such as a company’s being the low-\ncost producer (GEICO, Costco) or possessing a powerf ul world-wide brand (Coca-Cola, Gillette, American \nExpress) is essential for sustaine d success.  Business history is fille d with “Roman Candles,” companies \nwhose moats proved illusory and were soon crossed. \n \n Our criterion of “enduring” causes us to rule out companies in industries prone to rapid and continuous change.  Though capitalism’s “creative destru ction” is highly beneficial for society, it precludes \ninvestment certainty.  A moat that must be continuously rebuilt will eventually be no moat at all. \n \n Additionally, this criterion elim inates the business whose success depends  on having a great \nmanager.  Of course, a terrific CEO is a huge asset for any enterprise, and at Berkshire we have an abundance of these managers.  Their abilities have created billions of dollars of value that would never have materialized if typical CEOs had been running their businesses.  \n \n But if a business requires a superstar to produce great results, the business itself cannot be deemed \ngreat.  A medical partnership led by your area’s premier brain surgeon may enjoy outsized and growing \nearnings, but that tells little about its future.  The pa rtnership’s moat will go when the surgeon goes.  You \ncan count, though, on the moat of the Mayo Clinic to endure, even though you can’t name its CEO. \n \n 6\n\n Long-term competitive advantage in a stable industry is what we seek in a business.  If that comes \nwith rapid organic growth, great.  But even without organic growth, such a business is rewarding.  We will  \nsimply take the lush earnings of the business and use th em to buy similar businesses elsewhere.  There’s no  \nrule that you have to invest money where you’ve earned it.  Indeed, it’s often a mistake to do so: Truly great businesses, earning huge returns on tangible assets, can’t for any extended period reinvest a large \nportion of their earnings internally at high rates of return. \n \n Let’s look at the prototype of a dream busine ss, our own See’s Candy.  The boxed-chocolates \nindustry in which it operates is unexciting: Per-capita consumption in the U.S. is extremely low and doesn’t \ngrow.  Many once-important brands have disappeared, and only three companies have earned more than token profits over the last forty years.  Indeed, I believe that See’s, though it obtains the bulk of its revenues \nfrom only a few states, accounts for nearly half of the entire industry’s earnings. \n \n At See’s, annual sales were 16 million pounds of candy when Blue Chip Stamps purchased the \ncompany in 1972.  (Charlie and I controlled Blue Chip at the time and later merged it into Berkshire.)  Last year See’s sold 31 million pounds, a growth rate of only 2% annually.  Yet its durable competitive \nadvantage, built by the See’s family over a 50-year period, and strengthened subsequently by Chuck Huggins and Brad Kinstler, has produced extraordinary results  for Berkshire. \n \n We bought See’s for $25 million when its sales were $30 million and pre-tax earnings were less \nthan $5 million.  The capital then required to conduct the business was $8 million.  (Modest seasonal debt was also needed for a few months each year.)  Co nsequently, the company wa s earning 60% pre-tax on \ninvested capital.  Two factors helped to minimize the funds required for operations.  First, the product was sold for cash, and that eliminated  accounts receivable.  Second, the production and dist ribution cycle was \nshort, which minimized inventories. \n \n Last year See’s sales were $383 million, and pre-tax profits were $82 million.  The capital now \nrequired to run the business is $40 million.  This means we have had to reinvest only $32 million since \n1972 to handle the modest physical growth – and somewhat immodest financial growth – of the business.  In the meantime pre-tax earnings have totaled $1.35 billion.  All of that , except for the $32 million, has \nbeen sent to Berkshire (or, in the early years, to Blue Chip).  After paying corporate taxes on the profits, we \nhave used the rest to buy other attractive businesses.  Just as Adam and Eve kick-started an activity that led \nto six billion humans, See’s has given birth to multiple new streams of cash for us.  (The biblical command to “be fruitful and multiply” is one we take seriously at Berkshire.) \n \n There aren’t many See’s in Corporate America.  Typically, companies that increase their earnings \nfrom $5 million to $82 million require, say, $400 million or so of capital investment to finance their \ngrowth.  That’s because growing businesses have bot h working capital needs that increase in proportion to \nsales growth and significant require ments for fixed asset investments. \n \n A company that needs large incr eases in capital to engender its growth may well prove to be a \nsatisfactory investment.  There is, to follow through on our example, nothing shabby about earning $82 \nmillion pre-tax on $400 million of net tangible assets.  But that equation for the owner is vastly different \nfrom the See’s situation.  It’s far better to have an  ever-increasing stream of earnings with virtually no \nmajor capital requirements.  Ask Microsoft or Google. \n \n One example of good, but far from sensational, business economics is our own FlightSafety.  This \ncompany delivers benefits to its customers that are the equal of those delivered by any business that I know \nof.  It also possesses a durable competitive advantage: Going to any other flight-training provider than the \nbest is like taking the low bid on a surgical procedure. \n 7\n\n Nevertheless, this business requires a significant reinvestment of earnings if it is to grow.  When \nwe purchased FlightSafety in 1996, its pre-tax operatin g earnings were $111 million, and its net investment \nin fixed assets was $570 million.  Since our purchase, depreciation charges have totaled $923 million.  But \ncapital expenditures have totaled $1.635 billion, most of that for simulators to match the new airplane models that are constantly being introduced.  (A simulator can cost us more than $12 million, and we have \n273 of them.)  Our fixed assets, after depreciatio n, now amount to $1.079 billion.  Pre-tax operating \nearnings in 2007 were $270 million, a gain of $159 million since 1996.  That gain gave us a good, but far \nfrom See’s-like, return on our incremental investment of $509 million. \n \n Consequently, if measured only by economic returns, FlightSafety is an excellent but not extraordinary business.  Its put-up-more-to-earn-more ex perience is that faced by most corporations.  For \nexample, our large investment in regulated utilities falls squarely in this category.  We will earn considerably more money in this business ten years from  now, but we will invest many billions to make it. \n \n Now let’s move to the gruesome.  The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires significant capital to engender the growth, and then ea rns little or no money.  Think airlines.  Here a \ndurable  competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers.  Indeed, if a \nfarsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk , he would have done his successors a huge favor by \nshooting Orville down. \n \n The airline industry’s demand for ca pital ever since that first flight  has been insatiable.  Investors \nhave poured money into a bottomless pit, attracted by growth when they should have been repelled by it.  \nAnd I, to my shame, participated in this foolishne ss when I had Berkshire buy U.S. Air preferred stock in \n1989.  As the ink was drying on our check, the company went into a tailspin, and before long our preferred \ndividend was no longer being paid.  But we then got very lucky.  In one of the recurrent, but always \nmisguided, bursts of optimism for airlines, we were actua lly able to sell our shares in 1998 for a hefty gain.  \nIn the decade following our sale, the company went bankrupt.  Twice. \n \n To sum up, think of three types of “savings accoun ts.”  The great one pays an extraordinarily high \ninterest rate that will rise as the years pass.  The good one pays an attractive rate of interest that will be \nearned also on deposits that are added.  Finally, the gruesome account both pays an inadequate interest rate \nand requires you to keep adding money at those disappointing returns. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n And now it’s confession time.  It should be noted that no consultant, board of directors or investment banker pushed me into the mistakes I will describe.  In tennis parlance, they were all unforced \nerrors. \n \n To begin with, I almost blew the See’s purchase.  The seller was asking $30 million, and I was adamant about not going above $25 million.  Fortunately, he caved.  Otherwise I would have balked, and \nthat $1.35 billion would have gone to somebody else. \n \n About the time of the See’s purchase, Tom Murphy, then running Capital Cities Broadcasting, called and offered me the Dallas-Fort Worth NBC station for $35 million.  The station came with the Fort Worth paper that Capital Cities was buying, and under the “cross-ownership” rules Murph had to divest it.  \nI knew that TV stations were See’s-like businesses that required virtually no capital investment and had \nexcellent prospects for growth.  They were simple to run and showered cash on their owners. \n \n Moreover, Murph, then as now, was a close frien d, a man I admired as an extraordinary manager \nand outstanding human being.  He knew the television business forward and backward and would not have called me unless he felt a purchase was certain to work.  In effect Murph whispered “buy” into my ear.  But \nI didn’t listen. \n \n 8\n\n In 2006, the station earned $73 million pre-tax, bringing its total earnings since I turned down the \ndeal to at least $1 billion – almost all available to its  owner for other purposes.  Moreover, the property now \nhas a capital value of about $800 million.  Why did I say “no”?  The only explanation is that my brain had gone on vacation and forgot to notify me.  (My behavior resembled that of a politician Molly Ivins once described: “If his I.Q. was any lower, you would have to water him twice a day.”) \n \n Finally, I made an even worse mistake when I sa id “yes” to Dexter, a shoe business I bought in \n1993 for $433 million in Berkshire stock (25,203 shar es of A).  What I had assessed as durable competitive \nadvantage vanished within a few years.  But that’s just the beginning: By using Berkshire stock, I compounded this error hugely.  That move made the cost to Berkshire shareholders not $400 million, but rather $3.5 billion.  In essence, I gave away 1.6% of a wonderful business – one now valued at $220 billion \n– to buy a worthless business. \n \n To date , Dexter is the worst deal that I’ve made.  But I’ll make more mistakes in the future – you \ncan bet on that.  A line from Bobby Bare’s country so ng explains what too often happens with acquisitions: \n“I’ve never gone to bed with an ugly woman, but I’ve sure woke up with a few.” \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Now, let’s examine the four major operating sectors of Berkshire.  Each sector has vastly different \nbalance sheet and income account characteristics.  Ther efore, lumping them together impedes analysis.  So \nwe’ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them. \n \nInsurance \n \n The best anecdote I’ve heard during the current presidential campaign came from Mitt Romney, who asked his wife, Ann, “When we were young, did you ever in your wildest dreams think I might be \npresident?”  To which she replied, “Honey, you weren’t in my wildest dreams.” \n \n When we first entered the property/casualty insurance business in 1967, my wildest dreams did not envision our current operation.  Here’s how we did in the first five years after purchasing National Indemnity: \n \nYear Underwriting Profit (Loss) Float\n                              (in millions)  \n1967 $  0.4 $18.5 \n1968 0.6 21.3 \n1969 0.1 25.4 \n1970 (0.4) 39.4 \n1971 1.4 65.6 \n \n To put it charitably, we were a slow starter.  But th ings changed.  Here’s the record of the last five \nyears: \n \nYear Underwriting Profit (Loss) Float\n                               (in millions)  \n2003 $1,718 $44,220 \n2004 1,551 46,094 \n2005 53 49,287 \n2006 3,838 50,887 \n2007 3,374 58,698 \n \n This metamorphosis has been accomplished by some  extraordinary managers .  Let’s look at what \neach has achieved. \n 9\n\n \n• GEICO possesses the widest moat of any of our in surers, one carefully protected and expanded by \nTony Nicely, its CEO.  Last year – again – GEICO had the best growth record among major auto \ninsurers, increasing its market share to 7.2%.  Wh en Berkshire acquired cont rol in 1995, that share \nwas 2.5%.  Not coincidentally, annual ad expend itures by GEICO have increased from $31 million \nto $751 million during the same period. \n \nTony, now 64, joined GEICO at 18.  Every day si nce, he has been passiona te about the company – \nproud of how it could both save money for its cu stomers and provide growth opportunities for its \nassociates.  Even now, with sales at $12 billion, To ny feels GEICO is just getting started.  So do I. \n \nHere’s some evidence.  In the last three years, GEICO has increased its share of the motorcycle market from 2.1% to 6%.  We’ve also recently begun writing policies on ATVs and RVs.  And in \nNovember we wrote our first commercial  auto policy.  GEICO and National Indemnity are \nworking together in the commercial field, and early results are very encouraging. \n \nEven in aggregate, these lines will remain a small fraction of our personal auto volume.  \nNevertheless, they should deliver a growing stream of underwriting profits and float. \n \n• General Re, our international reinsurer, is by far our largest source of “home-grown” float – $23 billion at yearend.  This operation is now a huge asset for Berkshire.  Our ownership, however, \nhad a shaky start. \n \nFor decades, General Re was the Tiffany of rein surers, admired by all for its underwriting skills \nand discipline.  This reputation, unfortunately, outlived its factual underpinnings, a flaw that I \ncompletely missed when I made the decision in 1998 to merge with General Re.  The General Re \nof 1998 was not operated as the General Re of 1968 or 1978. \n \nNow, thanks to Joe Brandon, General Re’s CEO, and his partner, Tad Montross, the luster of the company has been restored.  Joe and Tad have been running the business for six years and have \nbeen doing first-class business in a first-class way, to use the words of J. P. Morgan.  They have \nrestored discipline to underwriting, reserving and the selection of clients. \n \nTheir job was made more difficult by costly and time-consuming legacy problems, both in the \nU.S. and abroad.  Despite that diversion, Joe and Tad have delivered excellent underwriting results while skillfully repositioning the company for the future. \n \n• Since joining Berkshire in 1986, Ajit Jain has built a truly great specialty reinsurance operation from scratch.  For one-of-a-kind mammoth transactions, the world now turns to him. \n \nLast year I told you in detail about the Equitas tr ansfer of huge, but capped, liabilities to Berkshire \nfor a single premium of $7.1 billion.  At this very early date, our experience has been good.  But \nthis doesn’t tell us much because it’s just one st raw in a fifty-year-or-more wind.  What we know \nfor sure, however, is that the London team who joined us, headed by Scott Moser, is first-rate and \nhas become a valuable asset for our insurance business. \n \n• Finally, we have our smaller operations, which serve specialized segments of the insurance \nmarket.  In aggregate, these companies have performed extraordinarily  well, earning above-\naverage underwriting profits and deliver ing valuable float for investment. \n \nLast year BoatU.S., headed by Bill Oakerson, was added to the group.  This company manages an \nassociation of about 650,000 boat owners, providing them services similar to those offered by AAA auto clubs to drivers.  Among the association’s offerings is boat insurance.  Learn more \nabout this operation by visiting its display at the annual meeting. \n \n 10\n\nBelow we show the record of our four categories of property/casualty insurance. \n \n Underwriting Profit Yearend Float\n          (in millions) \nInsurance Operations 2007 2006 2007 2006\nGeneral Re ....................... $   555 $   526 $23,009 $22,827 \nBH Reinsurance ............... 1,427 1,658 23,692 16,860 \nGEICO ............................. 1,113 1,314 7,768 7,171 \nOther Primary...................      279      340 *     4,229     4,029 * \n $3,374  $3,838  $58,698  $50,887  \n     \n  *  Includes Applied Underwriters from May 19, 2006. \n \nRegulated Utility Business \n \n Berkshire has an 87.4% (diluted) interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which owns a wide \nvariety of utility operations.  The largest of these are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, whose \n3.8 million electric customers make it the third largest distributor of electricity in the U.K.; (2) MidAmerican Energy, which serves 72 0,000 electric customers, primaril y in Iowa; (3) Pacific Power and \nRocky Mountain Power, serving about 1.7 million electric customers in six western states; and (4) Kern River and Northern Natural pipelines, which carry about 8% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S. \n \nOur partners in ownership of MidAmerican are Walter Scott, and its two terrific managers, Dave \nSokol and Greg Abel.  It’s unimpor tant how many votes each party has; we make major moves only when \nwe are unanimous in thinking them wise.  Eight years of working with Dave, Greg and Walter have \nunderscored my original belief: Berkshire couldn’t have better partners. \n \n Somewhat incongruously, MidAmerican also owns th e second largest real estate brokerage firm in \nthe U.S., HomeServices of America.  This company operates through 20 locally-branded firms with 18,800 \nagents.  Last year was a slow year for residential sales, and 2008 will probab ly be slower.  We will \ncontinue, however, to acquire quality brokerage operatio ns when they are available at sensible prices. \n \n Here are some key figures on MidAmerican’s operation: \n  \n Earnings (in millions)\n 2007 2006\nU.K. utilitie s .......................................................................................................  $     337  $     338 \nIowa u tility .........................................................................................................  412 348 \nWestern utilities (acquired Ma rch 21, 2006) .....................................................  692 356 \nPipelines .............................................................................................................  473 376 \nHomeServices.....................................................................................................  42 74 \nOther (net) ..........................................................................................................        130       245\nEarnings before corporate inte rest and taxes ......................................................  2,086 1,737 \nInterest, other than to Berkshire .........................................................................

Why the odd figure of $35.05?  I originally decided the business \nwas worth $35.00 per share to Berkshire.  Now, I’m a “one-price” guy (remember See’s?) and for several \ndays the investment bankers representing MidAmerican had no luck in getting me to increase Berkshire’s offer.  But, finally, they caught me in a moment of weakness, and I caved, telling them I would go to \n$35.05.  With that, I explained, they could tell their client they had wrung the last nickel out of me.  At the \ntime, it hurt. \n \n Later on, in 2002, Berkshire purchased 6,700,000 shares at $60 to help finance the acquisition of one of our pipelines.  Lastly, in 2006, when MidAmerican bought PacifiCorp, we purchased 23,268,793 shares at $145 per share. \n \n In 2007, MidAmerican earned $15.78 per share.  However, 77¢ of that was non-recurring – a \nreduction in deferred tax at our British utility, resulting from a lowering of the U.K. corporate tax rate.  So \ncall normalized earnings $15.01 per share.  And ye s, I’m glad I wilted and offered the extra nickel. \n \nManufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations \n \n Our activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront.  Let’s look, though, at a summary \nbalance sheet and earnings stat ement for the entire group. \n \nBalance Sheet 12/31/07 (in millions)\n    \nAssets  Liabilities and Equity  \nCash and equivalents .............................. $  2,080 Notes payable ............................ $  1,278 \nAccounts and notes receivable ............... 4,488 Other current liabilities..............     7,652\nInventory ................................................ 5,793 Total current liabilities .............. 8,930 \nOther current assets ................................        470   \nTotal current asse ts................................. 12,831   \n    \nGoodwill and other intangibles............... 14,201 Deferred taxes............................ 828 \nFixed assets............................................. 9,605 Term debt and ot her liabilities... 3,079 \nOther assets.............................................     1,685 Equity ........................................   25,485\n $38,322   $38,322  \n \n \n    \nEarnings Statement (in millions)\n 2007 2006 2005\nRevenues .................................................................................... $59,100 $52,660 $46,896 \nOperating expenses (including depreciation of $955 in 2007,    \n $823 in 2006 and $699 in 2005) .......................................... 55,026 49,002 44,190 \nInterest expense ..........................................................................        127        132          83\nPre-tax earnings.......................................................................... 3,947* 3,526* 2,623* \nIncome taxes and mi nority interests ...........................................      1,594      1,395        977\nNet income ................................................................................. $   2,353  $   2,131  $  1,646  \n \n*Does not include purchase-accounting adjustments. \n \n  This motley group, which sells products ranging from lollipops to motor homes, earned a pleasing \n23% on average tangible net worth last year.  It’s not eworthy also that these op erations used only minor \nfinancial leverage in achieving that return.  Clearly we own some terrific businesses.  We purchased many of them, however, at large premiums to net worth – a point reflected in the goodwill item shown on the \nbalance sheet – and that fact re duces the earnings on our average carrying  value to 9.8%. \n \n 12\n\n Here are a few newsworthy items about companies in this sector: \n \n• Shaw, Acme Brick, Johns Manville and MiTek were all hurt in 2007 by the sharp housing \ndownturn, with their pre-tax earnings declining 27 %, 41%, 38%, and 9% respectively.  Overall, \nthese companies earned $941 million pre-tax compared to $1.296 billion in 2006.  \n \nLast year, Shaw, MiTek and Acme contracted fo r tuck-in acquisitions that will help future \nearnings.  You can be sure they will be looking for more of these.  \n \n• In a tough year for retailing, our standouts were See’s, Borsheims and Nebraska Furniture Mart. \n \nTwo years ago Brad Kinstler was made CEO of See’s.  We very seldom move managers from one industry to another at Berkshire.  But we made an exception with Brad, who had previously run \nour uniform company, Fechheimer, and Cypress Insu rance.  The move could not have worked out \nbetter.  In his two years, profits at See’s have increased more than 50%. \n \nAt Borsheims, sales increased 15.1%, helped by  a 27% gain during Shareholder Weekend.  Two \nyears ago, Susan Jacques suggested that we rem odel and expand the store.  I was skeptical, but \nSusan was right. \n \nSusan came to Borsheims 25 years ago as a $4-an-hour saleswoman.  Though she lacked a \nmanagerial background, I did not hesitate to make her CEO in 1994.  She’s smart, she loves the \nbusiness, and she loves her associates.  Th at beats having an MBA degree any time. \n \n(An aside: Charlie and I are not big fans of resumes.  Instead, we focus on brains, passion and integrity.  Another of our great managers is Cathy Baron Tamraz, who has significantly increased \nBusiness Wire’s earnings since we purchased it early in 2006.  She is an owner’s dream.  It is \npositively dangerous  to stand between Cathy and a business prospect.  Cathy, it should be noted, \nbegan her career as a cab driver.) \n \nFinally, at Nebraska Furniture Mart, earnings hit a record as our Omaha and Kansas City stores \neach had sales of about $400 million.  These, by  some margin, are the two top home furnishings \nstores in the country.  In a disastrous year for many furniture retailers, sales at Kansas City \nincreased 8%, while in Omaha the gain was 6%.  \n \nCredit the remarkable Blumkin brothers, Ron and Irv, for this performance.  Both are close \npersonal friends of mine and great businessmen. \n \n• Iscar continues its wondrous ways.  Its products are small carbide cutting tools that make large and very expensive machine tools more productive.  The raw material for carbide is tungsten, mined in \nChina.  For many decades, Iscar moved tungsten to  Israel, where brains turned it into something \nfar more valuable.  Late in 2007, Iscar opened a large plant in Dalian, China.  In effect, we’ve now \nmoved the brains to the tungsten.  Major opportu nities for growth await Iscar.  Its management \nteam, led by Eitan Wertheimer, Jacob Harpaz, and Da nny Goldman, is certain to make the most of \nthem.  \n \n• Flight services set a record in 2007 with pr e-tax earnings increasing 49% to $547 million.  \nCorporate aviation had an extraordinary year worldwide, and both of our companies – as runaway \nleaders in their fields  – fully participated. \n \nFlightSafety, our pilot training business, gained 14% in revenues and 20% in pre-tax earnings.  We estimate that we train about 58% of U.S. corporate pilots.  Bruc e Whitman, the company’s \nCEO, inherited this leadership position in 2003 fr om Al Ueltschi, the father of advanced flight \ntraining, and has proved to be a worthy successor. \n 13\n\nAt NetJets, the inventor of fractional-ownership of jets, we also remain the unchallenged leader.  \nWe now operate 487 planes in the U.S. and 135 in Europe, a fleet more than twice the size of that \noperated by our three major competitors combined .  Because our share of the large-cabin market is \nnear 90%, our lead in value terms is far greater. \n \nThe NetJets brand – with its promise of safety, se rvice and security – grows stronger every year.  \nBehind this is the passion of one man, Richard Santulli.  If you were to pick someone to join you in a foxhole, you couldn’t do better than Rich.  No  matter what the obstacles, he just doesn’t stop. \n \nEurope is the best example of how Rich’s tenac ity leads to success.  For the first ten years we \nmade little financial progress there, actually runnin g up cumulative losses of $212 million.  After \nRich brought Mark Booth on board to run Europe, however, we began to gain traction.  Now we have real momentum, and last year earnings tripled. \n \nIn November, our directors met at NetJets head quarters in Columbus and got a look at the \nsophisticated operation there.  It is responsible for 1,000 or so flights a day in all kinds of weather, \nwith customers expecting top-notch service.  Ou r directors came away impressed by the facility \nand its capabilities – but even more impressed by Rich and his associates. \n \nFinance and Finance Products \n \n Our major operation in this category is Clayton Homes, the largest U.S. manufacturer and marketer of manufactured hom es.  Clayton’s market share hit a record 31% last y ear.  But industry volume \ncontinues to shrink:  Last year, manufactured home sales were 96,000, down from 131,000 in 2003, the \nyear we bought Clayton.  (At the time, it should be remembered, some commentators criticized its directors \nfor selling at a cyclical bottom.) \n \n Though Clayton earns money from both manufacturing and retailing its homes, most of its \nearnings come from an $11 billion loan portfolio, covering 300,000 borrowers.  That’s why we include \nClayton’s operation in this finance section.  Despite the many problems that surfaced during 2007 in real estate finance, the Clayton portfolio is performing well.  Delinquencies, foreclosures and losses during the \nyear were at rates similar to  those we experienced in our previous years of ownership. \n \n Clayton’s loan portfolio is financed by Berkshire.  For this funding, we charge Clayton one \npercentage point over Berkshire’s borrowing cost – a fee that amounted to $85 million last year.  Clayton’s 2007 pre-tax earnings of $526 million are after  its paying this fee.  The flip side of this transaction is that \nBerkshire recorded $85 million as income, which is included in “other” in the following table. \n \nPre-Tax Earnings  \n(in millions) \n 2007 2006\nTrading – ordinary income.............................  $    272 $    274 \nLife and annuity ope ration ............................

That company also borrowed $400 million last year and distributed the proceeds to Berkshire.  The resulting \nhigher interest it is now paying further reduced XTRA’s earnings. \n 14\n\n Clayton, XTRA and CORT are all good businesses , very ably run by Kevin Clayton, Bill Franz \nand Paul Arnold.  Each has made tuck-in acquisitions  during Berkshire’s ownership.  More will come. \n \nInvestments  \n \n We show below our common stock investments at yearend, itemizing those with a market value of \nat least $600 million. \n \n  12/31/07 \n  Percentage of    \nShares Company Company Owned Cost* Market\n   (in millions)  \n     \n151,610,700 American Express Comp any ................... 13.1 $  1,287 $  7,887 \n35,563,200 Anheuser-Busch Comp anies, Inc............. 4.8 1,718 1,861 \n60,828,818 Burlington Northern  Santa Fe.................. 17.5 4,731 5,063 \n200,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company ........................ 8.6 1,299 12,274 \n17,508,700 Cono co Phillips ....................................... 1.1 1,039 1,546 \n64,271,948 Johnson & Johnson.................................. 2.2 3,943 4,287 \n124,393,800 Kraft Foods Inc........................................ 8.1 4,152 4,059 \n48,000,000 Moody’s Corporation .............................. 19.1 499 1,714 \n3,486,006 POSCO .................................................... 4.5 572 2,136 \n101,472,000 The Procter & Gamble Company ............ 3.3 1,030 7,450 \n17,170,953 Sanofi-Aventis......................................... 1.3 1,466 1,575 \n227,307,000 Tesco pl c.................................................. 2.9 1,326 2,156 \n75,176,026 U.S. Bancorp ........................................... 4.4 2,417 2,386 \n17,072,192 USG Co rp................................................ 17.2 536 611 \n19,944,300 Wal-Mart St ores, Inc. .............................. 0.5 942 948 \n1,727,765 The Washington Po st Company .............. 18.2 11 1,367 \n303,407,068 Wells Fargo & Company......................... 9.2 6,677 9,160 \n1,724,200 White Mountains Insurance Group Ltd. .. 16.3 369 886 \n Others ......................................................      5,238     7,633\n Total Common Stocks .............................  $39,252  $74,999  \n \n*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP “cost” differs in a few cases because of write-ups or write-downs that have been required. \n \n Overall, we are delighted by the business performance of our investees.  In 2007, American \nExpress, Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble, three of our four largest holdings, increased per-share earnings \nby 12%, 14% and 14%.  The fourth, Wells Fargo, had a small decline in earnings because of the popping of the real estate bubble.  Nevertheless, I believe its intr insic value increased, even if only by a minor amount. \n \n In the strange world department, note that American Express and Wells Fargo were both organized by Henry Wells and William Fargo, Amex in 1850 and Wells in 1852.  P&G and Coke began \nbusiness in 1837 and 1886 respectively.  Start-ups are not our game. \n \n I should emphasize that we do not measure the progress of our in vestments by what their market \nprices do during any given year.  Rather, we evaluate their performance by the two methods we apply to the \nbusinesses we own.  The first test is improvement in earnings, with our making due allowance for industry conditions.  The second test, more subjective, is whether their “moats” – a metaphor for the superiorities \nthey possess that make life difficult for their competitors – have widened during the year.  All of the “big \nfour” scored positively on that test. \n 15\n\n We made one large sale last year.  In 2002 and 2003 Berkshire bought 1.3% of PetroChina for \n$488 million, a price that valued the entire business at about  $37 billion.  Charlie a nd I then felt that the \ncompany was worth about $100 billion.  By 2007, two factors had materially increased its value: the price of oil had climbed significantly, and PetroChina’s management had done a great job in building oil and gas reserves.  In the second half of last year, the market  value of the company rose to $275 billion, about what \nwe thought it was worth compared to other giant oil companies.  So we sold our holdings for $4 billion. \n \n A footnote: We paid the IRS tax of $1.2 billion on our PetroChina gain.  This sum paid all costs of \nthe U.S. government – defense, social security, you name it – for about four hours. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Last year I told you that Berkshire had 62 derivative contracts that I manage.  (We also have a few left in the General Re runoff book.)  Today, we ha ve 94 of these, and they fall into two categories. \n \n First, we have written 54 contracts that require us to make payments if certain bonds that are \nincluded in various high-yield indices default.  These contracts expire at various times from 2009 to 2013.  \nAt yearend we had received $3.2 billion in premiums on these co ntracts; had paid $472 million in losses; \nand in the worst case (though it is extremely unlikely to occur) could be required to pay an additional $4.7 \nbillion. \n \n We are certain to make many more payments.  But I believe that on premium revenues alone, \nthese contracts will prove profitable, leaving aside what we can earn on the large sums we hold.  Our \nyearend liability for this exposure was recorded at $1.8 billion and is included in “Derivative Contract \nLiabilities” on our balance sheet. \n \n The second category of contracts involves various put options we have sold on four stock indices \n(the S&P 500 plus three foreign indices).  These puts had original terms of either 15 or 20 years and were struck at the market.  We have received premiums of $4.5 billion, and we recorded  a liability at yearend of \n$4.6 billion.  The puts in these contracts are exercisable only at their expiration dates, which occur between \n2019 and 2027, and Berkshire will then need to make a payment only if the index in question is quoted at a level below that existing on the day that the put was writte n.  Again, I believe these contracts, in aggregate, \nwill be profitable and that we will, in addition, receive substantial income from our investment of the premiums we hold during the 15- or 20-year period. \n \n Two aspects of our derivative contracts are particul arly important.  First, in all cases we hold the \nmoney, which means that we have no counterparty risk. \n \n Second, accounting rules for our derivative contracts differ from those applying to our investment portfolio.  In that portfolio, changes in value are applied to the net worth shown on Berkshire’s balance \nsheet, but do not affect earnings unless we sell (or write down) a holding.  Changes in the value of a \nderivative contract, however, must be applied each quarter to earnings. \n \n Thus, our derivative positions will sometimes cause large swings in reported earnings, even though Charlie and I might believe the intrinsic value of these positions has changed little.  He and I will not be bothered by these swings – even though they could easily amount to $1 billio n or more in a quarter – \nand we hope you won’t be either.  You will recall that in our catastrophe insuran ce business, we are always \nready to trade increased volatility in reported earnings in  the short run for greater gains in net worth in the \nlong run.  That is our philosophy in derivatives as well. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n The U.S. dollar weakened furt her in 2007 against major currencies, and it’s no mystery why: \nAmericans like buying products made elsewhere more than the rest of the world likes buying products made in the U.S.  Inevitably, that causes Amer ica to ship about $2 billion of IOUs and assets daily to the \nrest of the world.  And over time, that puts pressure on the dollar. \n 16\n\n When the dollar falls, it both makes our products cheaper for foreigners to buy and their products \nmore expensive for U.S. citizens.  That’s why a falling cu rrency is supposed to cure a trade deficit.  Indeed, \nthe U.S. deficit has undoubtedly been tempered by the large drop in the dollar.  But ponder this:  In 2002 when the Euro averaged 94.6¢, our tr ade deficit with Germany (the fifth largest of our trading partners) was \n$36 billion, whereas in 2007, with the Euro averagi ng $1.37, our deficit with Germany was up to $45 \nbillion.  Similarly, the Canadian dollar averaged 64¢ in 2002 and 93¢ in 2007.  Yet our trade deficit with Canada rose as well, from $50 billion in 2002 to $64 billion in 2007.  So far, at least, a plunging dollar has \nnot done much to bring our trade activity into balance. \n \n There’s been much talk  recently of sovereign wealth funds and how they are buyi ng large pieces \nof American businesses.  This is our doing, not some nefarious plot by foreign governments.  Our trade \nequation guarantees massive foreign investment in the U.S.  When we force-feed $2 billion daily to the rest of the world, they must invest in something  here.  Why should we complain when they choose stocks over \nbonds? \n \n Our country’s weakening currency is not the fault of OPEC, China, etc.  Other developed \ncountries rely on imported oil and compete against Chinese imports just as we do.  In developing a sensible \ntrade policy, the U.S. should not single out countries to punish or industries to protect.  Nor should we take actions likely to evoke retaliatory behavior that will reduce America’s exports, true trade that benefits both \nour country and the rest of the world. \n \n Our legislators should recognize, however, that  the current imbalances are unsustainable and \nshould therefore adopt policies that will materially reduce them s ooner rather than later.  Otherwise our $2 \nbillion daily of force-fed dollars to the rest of the world may produce global indigestion of an unpleasant \nsort.  (For other comments about the unsustainability of our trade deficits, see Alan Greenspan’s comments \non November 19, 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee’s minutes of June 29, 2004, and Ben \nBernanke’s statement on September 11, 2007.) \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n At Berkshire we held only one direct currency position during 2007.  That was in – hold your breath – the Brazilian real.  Not long ago, swapping dollars for reals would have been unthinkable.  After \nall, during the past century five versions of Brazilian currency have, in effect, turned into confetti.  As has \nbeen true in many countries whose currencies have  periodically withered and died, wealthy Brazilians \nsometimes stashed large sums in the U.S. to preserve their wealth. \n \n But any Brazilian who followed this apparently prudent course would have lost half his net worth \nover the past five years.  Here’s th e year-by-year record (ind exed) of the real versus the dollar from the end \nof 2002 to yearend 2007: 100; 122; 133; 152; 166; 199.  Every year the real went up and the dollar fell.  \nMoreover, during much of this period the Brazilian government was actually holding down the value of the \nreal and supporting our currency by buying dollars in the market. \n \n Our direct currency positions have yielded $2.3 b illion of pre-tax profits over  the past five years, \nand in addition we have profited by holding bonds of U.S. companies that are denominated in other \ncurrencies.  For example, in  2001 and 2002 we purchased €310 million Amazon.com, Inc. 6 7/8 of 2010 at \n57% of par.  At the time, Amazon bonds were priced as  “junk” credits, though they were anything but.  \n(Yes, Virginia, you can occasionally fi nd markets that are ridiculously ine fficient – or at least you can find \nthem anywhere except at the finance departments of some leading business schools.)   \n \n The Euro denomination of the Amazon bonds was a further, and important, attraction for us.  The \nEuro was at 95¢ when we bought in 2002.  Therefore, our cost in dollars came to only $169 million.  Now \nthe bonds sell at 102% of par and the Euro is worth $1.47.  In 2005 and 2006 some of our bonds were \ncalled and we received $253 million for them.  Our remaining bonds were valu ed at $162 million at \nyearend.  Of our $246 million of r ealized and unrealized gain, about $118 million is attributable to the fall \nin the dollar.  Currencies do matter. \n 17\n\n At Berkshire, we will attempt to further increase our stream of direct and indirect foreign earnings.  \nEven if we are successful, however, our assets and earnings will always be concentrated in the U.S.  \nDespite our country’s many imperfections and unrelenting problems of one sort or another, America’s rule of law, market-responsive economic system, and belief in meritocracy are almost  certain to produce ever-\ngrowing prosperity for its citizens. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n As I have told you before, we have for some time been well-prepared for CEO succession because \nwe have three outstanding internal candidates.  The board knows exactly whom it would pick if I were to become unavailable, either because of death or diminishing abilities.  And that would still leave the board with two backups. \n \n Last year I told you that we would also prom ptly complete a succession plan for the investment \njob at Berkshire, and we have i ndeed now identified four candidates who could succeed me in managing \ninvestments.  All manage substantial sums currently, and all have indicated a strong interest in coming to Berkshire if called.  The board knows the strengths of the four and would expect to hire one or more if the \nneed arises.  The candidates are yo ung to middle-aged, well-to-do to rich, and all wish to work for \nBerkshire for reasons that  go beyond compensation. \n \n (I’ve reluctantly discarded the notion of my continuing to manage the portfolio after my death – \nabandoning my hope to give new meaning to the term “thinking outside the box.”) \n \nFanciful Figures – How Public Companies Juice Earnings \n \n Former Senator Alan Simpson famously said: “Those who travel the high road in Washington \nneed not fear heavy traffic.”  If he had sought truly deserted streets, however, the Senator should have \nlooked to Corporate America’s accounting. \n \n An important referendum on which road businesses prefer occurred in 1994.  America’s CEOs had just strong-armed the U.S. Senate into ordering the Financial Accounting Standards Board to shut up, by a vote that was 88-9.  Before that rebuke the FASB had shown the audacity – by unanimous agreement, no \nless – to tell corporate chieftains that the stock optio ns they were being awarded represented a form of \ncompensation and that thei r value should be recorded as an expense. \n \n After the senators voted, the FASB – now educat ed on accounting principles by the Senate’s 88 \ncloset CPAs – decreed that companies could choose between two methods of reporting on options.  The preferred  treatment would be to expense their value, but it would also be allowable for companies to ignore \nthe expense as long as their options were issued at market value. \n \n A moment of truth had now arrived for America’s CEOs, and their reaction was not a pretty sight.  \nDuring the next six years, exactly two of the 500 companies in the S&P chose the preferred route.  CEOs of \nthe rest opted for the low road, thereby ignoring a large and obvious expense in order to report higher \n“earnings.”  I’m sure some of them also felt that if they opted for expensing, thei r directors might in future \nyears think twice before approving the mega-grants the managers longed for. \n \n It turned out that for many CEOs even the low road wasn’t good enough.  Under the weakened \nrule, there remained earnings consequen ces if options were issued with a strike price below market value.  \nNo problem.  To avoid that bothersome rule, a numb er of companies surreptitiously backdated options to \nfalsely indicate that they were granted at current market prices, when in fact they were dished out at prices \nwell below market. \n \n Decades of option-accounting nonsense have now been put to rest, but other accounting choices remain – important among these the investment-return assumption a company uses in calculating pension \nexpense.  It will come as no surprise that many comp anies continue to choose an assumption that allows \nthem to report less-than-solid “earni ngs.” For the 363 companies in the S& P that have pension plans, this \nassumption in 2006 averaged 8%.  Let’s look  at the chances of that being achieved. \n 18\n\n The average holdings of bonds and cash for all pension funds is about 28%, and on these assets \nreturns can be expected to be no more than 5%. Higher yields, of course, are obtainable but they carry with \nthem a risk of commensurate (or greater) loss. \n \n This means that the remaining 72% of assets – which are mostly in equities, either held directly or through vehicles such as hedge funds or private-equity investments – must earn 9.2% in order for the fund \noverall to achieve the postulated 8%.  And that return must be delivered after  all fees, which are now far \nhigher than they have ever been. \n \n How realistic is this expectation?  Let’s revisit some data I mentioned two years ago: During the 20\nth Century, the Dow advanced from 66 to 11,497.  This gain, though it appears huge, shrinks to 5.3% \nwhen compounded annually.  An investor who owned the Dow throughout the century would also have received generous dividends for much of  the period, but only about 2% or so in the final years.  It was a \nwonderful century. \n \n Think now about this century.  For investors to merely match that 5.3% market-value gain, the \nDow – recently below 13,000 – would need to close at about 2,000,000  on December 31, 2099.  We are \nnow eight years into this century, and we have racked up less than 2,000 of the 1,988,000 Dow points the market needed to travel in this hundred years to equal the 5.3% of the last. \n \n It’s amusing that commentators regularly hyperventilate at the prospect of the Dow crossing an even number of thousands, such as 14,000 or 15,000.  If they keep reacting that way, a 5.3% annual gain \nfor the century will mean they experience at least 1,986 seizures during the next 92 years.  While anything \nis possible, does anyone really believe this is the most likely outcome? \n \n Dividends continue to run about 2%.  Even if stocks were to average the 5.3% annual appreciation of the 1900s, the equity portion of plan assets – allowing for expenses of .5% – would produce no more than 7% or so.  And .5% may well understate costs, given the presence of layers of consultants and high-\npriced managers (“helpers”). \n \n Naturally, everyone expects to be  above average.  And those help ers – bless their hearts – will \ncertainly encourage their clients in this belief.  But, as a class, the helper-aided group must be below \naverage.  The reason is simple: 1) Investors, overall,  will necessarily earn an average return, minus costs \nthey incur; 2) Passive and index investors, through their very inactivity, will earn that average minus costs \nthat are very low; 3) With that group earning average returns, so mu st the remaining group – the active \ninvestors.  But this group will incur high transaction, management, and advisory costs.  Therefore, the \nactive investors will have their returns diminished by  a far greater percentage than will their inactive \nbrethren.  That means that the passive group – the “know-nothings” – must win. \n \n I should mention that people who expect to earn 10% annually from equities during this century – \nenvisioning that 2% of that will come from dividends and 8% from price appreciation – are implicitly forecasting a level of about 24,000,000  on the Dow by 2100.  If your adviser talks to you about double-\ndigit returns from equities, explain this  math to him – not that it will faze him.  Many helpers are apparently \ndirect descendants of the queen in Alice in Wonderland, who said: “Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.”  Beware the glib helper who fills your head with fantasies while \nhe fills his pockets with fees. \n \n Some companies have pension plans in Europe as well as in the U.S. and, in their accounting, \nalmost all assume that the U.S. plans will earn more than  the non-U.S. plans.  This discrepancy is puzzling: \nWhy should these companies not put th eir U.S. managers in charge of the non-U.S. pension assets and let \nthem work their magic on these assets as well?  I’ve never seen this puzzle explai ned.  But the auditors and \nactuaries who are charged with vetting the return assumptions seem to have no problem with it. \n 19\n\n What is no puzzle, however, is why CEOs opt for a high investment assumption: It lets them \nreport higher earnings.  And if they are wrong, as I be lieve they are, the chickens  won’t come home to roost \nuntil long after they retire. \n \n After decades of pushing the envelope – or worse – in its attempt to report the highest number \npossible for current earnings, Corporate America should ease up.  It should listen to my partner, Charlie: “If \nyou’ve hit three balls out of bounds to the left, aim a little to the right on the next swing.” \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Whatever pension-cost surprises are in store fo r shareholders down the road, these jolts will be \nsurpassed many times over by those experienced by taxpayers.  Public pension promises are huge and, in \nmany cases, funding is woefully inadequate.  Because th e fuse on this time bomb is  long, politicians flinch \nfrom inflicting tax pain, given that problems will only become apparent long after these officials have departed.  Promises involving very early retirement – sometimes to those in their low 40s – and generous \ncost-of-living adjustments ar e easy for these officials to make.  In a world where people are living longer \nand inflation is certain, those promises will be anything but easy to keep. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Having laid out the failures of an “honor system” in American accounting, I need to point out that \nthis is exactly the system existing at Berkshire for a truly huge balance-sheet item.  In every report we \nmake to you, we must guesstimate the loss reserves for our insurance units.  If our estimate is wrong, it means that both our balance sheet and our earnings statem ent will be wrong.  So naturally we do our best to \nmake these guesses accurate.  Nevertheless, in every report our estimate is sure to be wrong . \n \n At yearend 2007, we show an insurance liability of  $56 billion that represents our guess as to what \nwe will eventually pay for all loss events that occurred before yearend (except for about $3 billion of the reserve that has been discounted to present value).  We know of many thousands of events and have put a dollar value on each that reflects what we believe we  will pay, including the associated costs (such as \nattorney’s fees) that we will incur in the payment process.  In some cases, among them claims for certain \nserious injuries covered by work er’s compensation, payments will be made for 50 years or more. \n \n We also include a large reserve for losses that occu rred before yearend but that we have yet to hear \nabout.  Sometimes, th e insured itself does not know that a loss has occurred.  (Think of an embezzlement \nthat remains undiscovered for years.)  We sometimes hear about losses from policies that covered our insured many decades ago. \n \n A story I told you some years back illustrates our problem in accurately estimating our loss \nliability:  A fellow was on an important business trip in Europe when his sister called to tell him that their dad had died.  Her brother explained that he couldn’t get back but said to spare nothing on the funeral, \nwhose cost he would cover.  When he returned, his sister told him that the service had been beautiful and \npresented him with bills totaling $8,000.  He paid up but a month later received a bill from the mortuary for $10.  He paid that, too – and still another $10 charge he received a month later.  When a third $10 invoice \nwas sent to him the following month, the perplexed man called his sister to ask what was going on.  “Oh,” \nshe replied, “I forgot to tell you.  We buried Dad in a rented suit.” \n \n At our insurance companies we have an unknown, but most certainly large, number of “rented \nsuits” buried around the world.  We tr y to estimate the bill fo r them accurately.  In ten or twenty years, we \nwill even be able to make a good guess as to how inaccurate our present guess is.  But even that guess will \nbe subject to surprises.  I personally believe our stat ed reserves are adequate, but I’ve been wrong several \ntimes in the past. \n 20\n\nThe Annual Meeting  \n \n Our meeting this year will be held on Saturday, May 3rd.  As always, the doors will open at the \nQwest Center at 7 a.m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at 8:30.  At 9:30 we will go directly to \nthe question-and-answer period, whic h (with a break for lunch at the Qwest’s stands) will last until 3:00.  \nThen, after a short recess, Charlie an d I will convene the annual meeting at  3:15.  If you decide to leave \nduring the day’s question periods, please do so while Charlie  is talking. \n \n The best reason to exit, of course is to shop .  We will help you do that by filling the 194,300-\nsquare-foot hall that adjoins the meeting area with the products of Berkshire subsidiaries.  Last year, the 27,000 people who came to the meeting did their part, a nd almost every location rack ed up record sales.  \nBut you can do better.  (If necessary, I’ll lock the doors.) \n \n This year we will again showcase a Clayton ho me (featuring Acme brick, Shaw carpet, Johns \nManville insulation, MiTek fasteners, Carefree awnings and NFM furniture).  You will find that this 1,550-square-foot home, priced at $69,500, delivers excep tional value.  And after you purchase the house, \nconsider also acquiring the Forest River RV and pontoon boat on display nearby. \n \n GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of \nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes.  In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a special shareholder discount (usually 8% ).  This special offer is permitted by 45 of the 50 jurisdictions in \nwhich we operate.  (One supplemental point: The discount  is not additive if you qualify for another, such as \nthat given certain groups.)  Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money.  For at least 50% of you, I believe we can. \n \n On Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets available for your inspection.  Stop by the NetJets booth at the Qwest to learn about viewing these planes.  Come to \nOmaha by bus; leave in your new plane.  And take all the hair gel and scissors that you wish on board with \nyou. \n \n Next, if you have any money left, visit the Bookworm, where you will find about 25 books and \nDVDs – all discounted – led again by Poor Charlie’s Almanack .  Without any advertising or bookstore \nplacement, Charlie’s book has now re markably sold nearly 50,000 copies.  For those of you who can’t \nmake the meeting, go to poorcharliesalmanack.com  to order a copy. \n \n An attachment to the proxy material that is encl osed with this report explains how you can obtain \nthe credential you will need for admission to the meeti ng and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car \nreservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  Carol \nPedersen, who handles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it.  Hotel \nrooms can be hard to find, but work with Carol and you will get one. \n \n At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, \nwe will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing.  We initiated this special event at NFM \neleven years ago, and sales during the “Weekend” grew  from $5.3 million in 1997 to $30.9 million in 2007.  \nThis is more volume than most furniture stores register in a year. \n \n To obtain the Berkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, May 1st and \nMonday, May 5th inclusive, and also present your meeting cr edential.  The period’s special pricing will \neven apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against \ndiscounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you.  We appreciate their cooperation.  NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. \nto 6 p.m. on Sunday.  On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a Baja Beach Bash \nfeaturing beef and chicken tacos. \n 21\n\n At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events.  The first will be a cocktail \nreception from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, May 2nd.  The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, \nMay 4th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.  On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. \n \n We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend.  For your convenience, \ntherefore, shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 28th through Saturday, May 10th.  \nDuring that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder by pres enting your meeting credentials or a \nbrokerage statement that show s you are a Berkshire holder. \n \n On Sunday, in a tent outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess \nchampion, will take on all comers – who will have their eyes wide open – in groups of six.  Nearby, \nNorman Beck, a remarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers.  Additionally, we will have \nBob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the world’s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our \nshareholders on Sunday afternoon. \n \n Gorat’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 4th, and will be \nserving from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  Last year Gorat’s,  which seats 240, served 915 dinners on Shareholder \nSunday.  The three-day total was 2,487 including 656 T-bone steaks, the entrée preferred by the \ncognoscenti .  Please remember that to come to Gorat’s on th at day, you must have a reservation.  To make \none, call 402-551-3733 on April 1st (but not before ).   \n \n We will again have a reception at 4 p.m. on Satu rday afternoon fo r shareholders who have come \nfrom outside of North America.  Every year our meeting draws many people from around the globe, and Charlie and I want to be sure we personally greet those who have come so far.  Last year we enjoyed meeting more than 400 of you from many dozens of countries.  Any shareholder who comes from other \nthan the U.S. or Canada will be given a special cred ential and instructions for attending this function. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \n At 84 and 77, Charlie and I remain lucky beyond our dreams.  We were born in America; had \nterrific parents who saw that we got good educations; have enjoyed wonderful families and great health; and came equipped with a “business” gene that allows us to prosper in a manner hugely disproportionate to \nthat experienced by many people who contribute as much or more to our society’s well-being.  Moreover, \nwe have long had jobs that we love, in which we are helped in countless ways by talented and cheerful \nassociates.  Every day is exciting to us; no wonder we tap-dance to work.  But nothing is more fun for us \nthan getting together with our shareholder-partners at Berkshire’s annual meeting.  So join us on May 3\nrd at \nthe Qwest for our annual Woodstock for Capitalists.  We’ll see you there. \n \n \nFebruary 2008    Warren E. Buffett \n     Chairman of the Board \n \n \n 22",

In this table, Berkshire’s resultsthrough 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculated usingthe numbers originally reported.\nThe S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax . If a corporation such as Berkshire\nwere simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the indexshowed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n2\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOur decrease in net worth during 2008 was $11.5 billion, which reduced the per-share book value of\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 9.6%. Over the last 44 years (that is, since present management took over)\nbook value has grown from $19 to $70,530, a rate of 20.3% compounded annually.*\nThe table on the preceding page, recording both the 44-year performance of Berkshire’s book value\nand the S&P 500 index, shows that 2008 was the worst year for each. The period was devastating as well for\ncorporate and municipal bonds, real estate and commodities. By yearend, investors of all stripes were bloodiedand confused, much as if they were small birds that had strayed into a badminton game.\nAs the year progressed, a series of life-threatening problems within many of the world’s great financial\ninstitutions was unveiled. This led to a dysfunctional credit market that in important respects soon turnednon-functional. The watchword throughout the country became the creed I saw on restaurant walls when I wasyoung: “In God we trust; all others pay cash.”\nBy the fourth quarter, the credit crisis, coupled with tumbling home and stock prices, had produced a\nparalyzing fear that engulfed the country. A freefall in business activity ensued, accelerating at a pace that I havenever before witnessed. The U.S. – and much of the world – became trapped in a vicious negative-feedbackcycle. Fear led to business contraction, and that in turn led to even greater fear.\nThis debilitating spiral has spurred our government to take massive action. In poker terms, the Treasury\nand the Fed have gone “all in.” Economic medicine that was previously meted out by the cupful has recentlybeen dispensed by the barrel. These once-unthinkable dosages will almost certainly bring on unwelcomeaftereffects. Their precise nature is anyone’s guess, though one likely consequence is an onslaught of inflation.\nMoreover, major industries have become dependent on Federal assistance, and they will be followed by citiesand states bearing mind-boggling requests. Weaning these entities from the public teat will be a politicalchallenge. They won’t leave willingly.\nWhatever the downsides may be, strong and immediate action by government was essential last year if\nthe financial system was to avoid a total breakdown. Had one occurred, the consequences for every area of oureconomy would have been cataclysmic. Like it or not, the inhabitants of Wall Street, Main Street and the variousSide Streets of America were all in the same boat.\nAmid this bad news, however, never forget that our country has faced far worse travails in the past. In\nthe 20\nthCentury alone, we dealt with two great wars (one of which we initially appeared to be losing); a dozen or\nso panics and recessions; virulent inflation that led to a 211⁄2% prime rate in 1980; and the Great Depression of\nthe 1930s, when unemployment ranged between 15% and 25% for many years. America has had no shortage of\nchallenges.\nWithout fail, however, we’ve overcome them. In the face of those obstacles – and many others – the\nreal standard of living for Americans improved nearly seven -fold during the 1900s, while the Dow Jones\nIndustrials rose from 66 to 11,497. Compare the record of this period with the dozens of centuries during which\nhumans secured only tiny gains, if any, in how they lived. Though the path has not been smooth, our economic\nsystem has worked extraordinarily well over time. It has unleashed human potential as no other system has, and itwill continue to do so. America’s best days lie ahead.\n*All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are\n1/30thof those shown for A.\n3\n\nTake a look again at the 44-year table on page 2. In 75% of those years, the S&P stocks recorded a\ngain. I would guess that a roughly similar percentage of years will be positive in the next 44. But neither Charlie\nMunger, my partner in running Berkshire, nor I can predict the winning and losing years in advance. (In our\nusual opinionated view, we don’t think anyone else can either.) We’re certain, for example, that the economy will\nbe in shambles throughout 2009 – and, for that matter, probably well beyond – but that conclusion does not tellus whether the stock market will rise or fall.\nIn good years and bad, Charlie and I simply focus on four goals:\n(1) maintaining Berkshire’s Gibraltar-like financial position, which features huge amounts of\nexcess liquidity, near-term obligations that are modest, and dozens of sources of earnings\nand cash;\n(2) widening the “moats” around our operating businesses that give them durable competitive\nadvantages;\n(3) acquiring and developing new and varied streams of earnings;\n(4) expanding and nurturing the cadre of outstanding operating managers who, over the years,\nhave delivered Berkshire exceptional results.\nBerkshire in 2008\nMost of the Berkshire businesses whose results are significantly affected by the economy earned below\ntheir potential last year, and that will be true in 2009 as well. Our retailers were hit particularly hard, as were our\noperations tied to residential construction. In aggregate, however, our manufacturing, service and retailbusinesses earned substantial sums and most of them – particularly the larger ones – continue to strengthen theircompetitive positions. Moreover, we are fortunate that Berkshire’s two most important businesses – our\ninsurance and utility groups – produce earnings that are not correlated to those of the general economy. Bothbusinesses delivered outstanding results in 2008 and have excellent prospects.\nAs predicted in last year’s report, the exceptional underwriting profits that our insurance businesses\nrealized in 2007 were not repeated in 2008. Nevertheless, the insurance group delivered an underwriting gain forthe sixth consecutive year. This means that our $58.5 billion of insurance “float” – money that doesn’t belong tous but that we hold and invest for our own benefit – cost us less than zero. In fact, we were paid $2.8 billion to\nhold our float during 2008. Charlie and I find this enjoyable.\nOver time, most insurers experience a substantial underwriting loss, which makes their economics far\ndifferent from ours. Of course, we too will experience underwriting losses in some years. But we have the bestgroup of managers in the insurance business, and in most cases they oversee entrenched and valuable franchises.Considering these strengths, I believe that we will earn an underwriting profit over the years and that our floatwill therefore cost us nothing. Our insurance operation, the core business of Berkshire, is an economicpowerhouse.\nCharlie and I are equally enthusiastic about our utility business, which had record earnings last year\nand is poised for future gains. Dave Sokol and Greg Abel, the managers of this operation, have achieved resultsunmatched elsewhere in the utility industry. I love it when they come up with new projects because in thiscapital-intensive business these ventures are often large. Such projects offer Berkshire the opportunity to put outsubstantial sums at decent returns.\n4\n\nThings also went well on the capital-allocation front last year. Berkshire is always a buyer of both\nbusinesses and securities, and the disarray in markets gave us a tailwind in our purchases. When investing,\npessimism is your friend, euphoria the enemy.\nIn our insurance portfolios, we made three large investments on terms that would be unavailable in\nnormal markets. These should add about $11⁄2billion pre-tax to Berkshire’s annual earnings and offer\npossibilities for capital gains as well. We also closed on our Marmon acquisition (we own 64% of the companynow and will purchase its remaining stock over the next six years). Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries made\n“tuck-in” acquisitions that will strengthen their competitive positions and earnings.\nThat’s the good news. But there’s another less pleasant reality: During 2008 I did some dumb things in\ninvestments. I made at least one major mistake of commission and several lesser ones that also hurt. I will tell\nyou more about these later. Furthermore, I made some errors of omission, sucking my thumb when new facts\ncame in that should have caused me to re-examine my thinking and promptly take action.\nAdditionally, the market value of the bonds and stocks that we continue to hold suffered a significant\ndecline along with the general market. This does not bother Charlie and me. Indeed, we enjoy such price declinesif we have funds available to increase our positions. Long ago, Ben Graham taught me that “Price is what youpay; value is what you get.” Whether we’re talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandisewhen it is marked down.\nYardsticks\nBerkshire has two major areas of value. The first is our investments: stocks, bonds and cash\nequivalents. At yearend those totaled $122 billion (not counting the investments held by our finance and utility\noperations, which we assign to our second bucket of value). About $58.5 billion of that total is funded by ourinsurance float.\nBerkshire’s second component of value is earnings that come from sources other than investments and\ninsurance. These earnings are delivered by our 67 non-insurance companies, itemized on page 96. We excludeour insurance earnings from this calculation because the value of our insurance operation comes from theinvestable funds it generates, and we have already included this factor in our first bucket.\nIn 2008, our investments fell from $90,343 per share of Berkshire (after minority interest) to $77,793, a\ndecrease that was caused by a decline in market prices, not by net sales of stocks or bonds. Our second segment\nof value fell from pre-tax earnings of $4,093 per Berkshire share to $3,921 (again after minority interest).\nBoth of these performances are unsatisfactory. Over time, we need to make decent gains in each area if\nwe are to increase Berkshire’s intrinsic value at an acceptable rate. Going forward, however, our focus will be onthe earnings segment, just as it has been for several decades. We like buying underpriced securities, but we likebuying fairly-priced operating businesses even more.\nNow, let’s take a look at the four major operating sectors of Berkshire. Each of these has vastly\ndifferent balance sheet and income account characteristics. Therefore, lumping them together, as is done instandard financial statements, impedes analysis. So we’ll present them as four separate businesses, which is howCharlie and I view them.\n5\n\nRegulated Utility Business\nBerkshire has an 87.4% (diluted) interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which owns a wide\nvariety of utility operations. The largest of these are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, whose\n3.8 million end users make it the U.K.’s third largest distributor of electricity; (2) MidAmerican Energy, whichserves 723,000 electric customers, primarily in Iowa; (3) Pacific Power and Rocky Mountain Power, servingabout 1.7 million electric customers in six western states; and (4) Kern River and Northern Natural pipelines,\nwhich carry about 9% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S.\nOur partners in ownership of MidAmerican are its two terrific managers, Dave Sokol and Greg Abel,\nand my long-time friend, Walter Scott. It’s unimportant how many votes each party has; we make major movesonly when we are unanimous in thinking them wise. Nine years of working with Dave, Greg and Walter havereinforced my original belief: Berkshire couldn’t have better partners.\nSomewhat incongruously, MidAmerican also owns the second largest real estate brokerage firm in the\nU.S., HomeServices of America. This company operates through 21 locally-branded firms that have 16,000agents. Last year was a terrible year for home sales, and 2009 looks no better. We will continue, however, toacquire quality brokerage operations when they are available at sensible prices.\nHere are some key figures on MidAmerican’s operations:\nEarnings (in millions)\n2008 2007\nU.K. utilities ............................................................ $ 3 3 9 $ 3 3 7\nIowa utility ............................................................. 4 2 5 4 1 2\nWestern utilities ......................................................... 7 0 3 6 9 2\nPipelines ............................................................... 5 9 5 4 7 3\nHomeServices ...........................................................

Here’s some backup for that claim.\nOur two pipelines, Kern River and Northern Natural, were both acquired in 2002. A firm called Mastio\nregularly ranks pipelines for customer satisfaction. Among the 44 rated, Kern River came in 9thwhen we\npurchased it and Northern Natural ranked 39th. There was work to do.\nIn Mastio’s 2009 report, Kern River ranked 1stand Northern Natural 3rd. Charlie and I couldn’t be more\nproud of this performance. It came about because hundreds of people at each operation committed themselves to\na new culture and then delivered on their commitment.\nAchievements at our electric utilities have been equally impressive. In 1995, MidAmerican became the\nmajor provider of electricity in Iowa. By judicious planning and a zeal for efficiency, the company has kept\nelectric prices unchanged since our purchase and has promised to hold them steady through 2013.\n6\n\nMidAmerican has maintained this extraordinary price stability while making Iowa number one among\nall states in the percentage of its generation capacity that comes from wind. Since our purchase, MidAmerican’s\nwind-based facilities have grown from zero to almost 20% of total capacity.\nSimilarly, when we purchased PacifiCorp in 2006, we moved aggressively to expand wind generation.\nWind capacity was then 33 megawatts. It’s now 794, with more coming. (Arriving at PacifiCorp, we found\n“wind” of a different sort: The company had 98 committees that met frequently. Now there are 28. Meanwhile,we generate and deliver considerably more electricity, doing so with 2% fewer employees.)\nIn 2008 alone, MidAmerican spent $1.8 billion on wind generation at our two operations, and today the\ncompany is number one in the nation among regulated utilities in ownership of wind capacity. By the way,\ncompare that $1.8 billion to the $1.1 billion of pre-tax earnings of PacifiCorp (shown in the table as “Western”)and Iowa. In our utility business, we spend all we earn, and then some, in order to fulfill the needs of our serviceareas. Indeed, MidAmerican has not paid a dividend since Berkshire bought into the company in early 2000. Itsearnings have instead been reinvested to develop the utility systems our customers require and deserve. Inexchange, we have been allowed to earn a fair return on the huge sums we have invested. It’s a great partnershipfor all concerned.\n************\nOur long-avowed goal is to be the “buyer of choice” for businesses – particularly those built and owned\nby families. The way to achieve this goal is to deserve it. That means we must keep our promises; avoidleveraging up acquired businesses; grant unusual autonomy to our managers; and hold the purchased companiesthrough thick and thin (though we prefer thick and thicker).\nOur record matches our rhetoric. Most buyers competing against us, however, follow a different path.\nFor them, acquisitions are “merchandise.” Before the ink dries on their purchase contracts, these operators arecontemplating “exit strategies.” We have a decided advantage, therefore, when we encounter sellers who truly\ncare about the future of their businesses.\nSome years back our competitors were known as “leveraged-buyout operators.” But LBO became a\nbad name. So in Orwellian fashion, the buyout firms decided to change their moniker. What they did not change,though, were the essential ingredients of their previous operations, including their cherished fee structures andlove of leverage.\nTheir new label became “private equity,” a name that turns the facts upside-down: A purchase of a\nbusiness by these firms almost invariably results in dramatic reductions in the equity portion of the acquiree’s\ncapital structure compared to that previously existing. A number of these acquirees, purchased only two to threeyears ago, are now in mortal danger because of the debt piled on them by their private-equity buyers. Much ofthe bank debt is selling below 70¢ on the dollar, and the public debt has taken a far greater beating. The private-equity firms, it should be noted, are not rushing in to inject the equity their wards now desperately need. Instead,they’re keeping their remaining funds very private.\nIn the regulated utility field there are no large family-owned businesses. Here, Berkshire hopes to be\nthe “buyer of choice” of regulators . It is they, rather than selling shareholders, who judge the fitness of\npurchasers when transactions are proposed.\nThere is no hiding your history when you stand before these regulators. They can – and do – call their\ncounterparts in other states where you operate and ask how you have behaved in respect to all aspects of thebusiness, including a willingness to commit adequate equity capital.\n7\n\nWhen MidAmerican proposed its purchase of PacifiCorp in 2005, regulators in the six new states we\nwould be serving immediately checked our record in Iowa. They also carefully evaluated our financing plans and\ncapabilities. We passed this examination, just as we expect to pass future ones.\nThere are two reasons for our confidence. First, Dave Sokol and Greg Abel are going to run any\nbusinesses with which they are associated in a first-class manner. They don’t know of any other way to operate.\nBeyond that is the fact that we hope to buy more regulated utilities in the future – and we know that our businessbehavior in jurisdictions where we are operating today will determine how we are welcomed by new jurisdictions\ntomorrow.\nInsurance\nOur insurance group has propelled Berkshire’s growth since we first entered the business in 1967. This\nhappy result has not been due to general prosperity in the industry. During the 25 years ending in 2007, return on\nnet worth for insurers averaged 8.5% versus 14.0% for the Fortune 500. Clearly our insurance CEOs have not\nhad the wind at their back. Yet these managers have excelled to a degree Charlie and I never dreamed possible inthe early days. Why do I love them? Let me count the ways.\nAt GEICO, Tony Nicely – now in his 48th year at the company after joining it when he was 18 –\ncontinues to gobble up market share while maintaining disciplined underwriting. When Tony became CEO in1993, GEICO had 2.0% of the auto insurance market, a level at which the company had long been stuck. Now wehave a 7.7% share, up from 7.2% in 2007.\nThe combination of new business gains and an improvement in the renewal rate on existing business\nhas moved GEICO into the number three position among auto insurers. In 1995, when Berkshire purchasedcontrol, GEICO was number seven. Now we trail only State Farm and Allstate.\nGEICO grows because it saves money for motorists. No one likes to buy auto insurance. But virtually\neveryone likes to drive. So, sensibly, drivers look for the lowest-cost insurance consistent with first-class service.\nEfficiency is the key to low cost, and efficiency is Tony’s specialty. Five years ago the number of policies peremployee was 299. In 2008, the number was 439, a huge increase in productivity.\nAs we view GEICO’s current opportunities, Tony and I feel like two hungry mosquitoes in a nudist\ncamp. Juicy targets are everywhere. First, and most important, our new business in auto insurance is nowexploding. Americans are focused on saving money as never before, and they are flocking to GEICO. In January2009, we set a monthly record – by a wide margin – for growth in policyholders. That record will last exactly 28days: As we go to press, it’s clear February’s gain will be even better.\nBeyond this, we are gaining ground in allied lines. Last year, our motorcycle policies increased by\n23.4%, which raised our market share from about 6% to more than 7%. Our RV and ATV businesses are alsogrowing rapidly, albeit from a small base. And, finally, we recently began insuring commercial autos, a bigmarket that offers real promise.\nGEICO is now saving money for millions of Americans. Go to GEICO.com or call 1-800-847-7536\nand see if we can save you money as well.\nGeneral Re, our large international reinsurer, also had an outstanding year in 2008. Some time back,\nthe company had serious problems (which I totally failed to detect when we purchased it in late 1998). By 2001,when Joe Brandon took over as CEO, assisted by his partner, Tad Montross, General Re’s culture had furtherdeteriorated, exhibiting a loss of discipline in underwriting, reserving and expenses. After Joe and Tad tookcharge, these problems were decisively and successfully addressed. Today General Re has regained its luster.Last spring Joe stepped down, and Tad became CEO. Charlie and I are grateful to Joe for righting the ship andare certain that, with Tad, General Re’s future is in the best of hands.\n8\n\nReinsurance is a business of long-term promises, sometimes extending for fifty years or more. This\npast year has retaught clients a crucial principle: A promise is no better than the person or institution making it.\nThat’s where General Re excels: It is the only reinsurer that is backed by an AAA corporation. Ben Franklin once\nsaid, “It’s difficult for an empty sack to stand upright.” That’s no worry for General Re clients.\nOur third major insurance operation is Ajit Jain’s reinsurance division, headquartered in Stamford and\nstaffed by only 31 employees. This may be one of the most remarkable businesses in the world, hard to\ncharacterize but easy to admire.\nFrom year to year, Ajit’s business is never the same. It features very large transactions, incredible\nspeed of execution and a willingness to quote on policies that leave others scratching their heads. When there is a\nhuge and unusual risk to be insured, Ajit is almost certain to be called.\nAjit came to Berkshire in 1986. Very quickly, I realized that we had acquired an extraordinary talent.\nSo I did the logical thing: I wrote his parents in New Delhi and asked if they had another one like him at home.Of course, I knew the answer before writing. There isn’t anyone like Ajit.\nOur smaller insurers are just as outstanding in their own way as the “big three,” regularly delivering\nvaluable float to us at a negative cost. We aggregate their results below under “Other Primary.” For spacereasons, we don’t discuss these insurers individually. But be assured that Charlie and I appreciate thecontribution of each.\nHere is the record for the four legs to our insurance stool. The underwriting profits signify that all four\nprovided funds to Berkshire last year without cost, just as they did in 2007. And in both years our underwritingprofitability was considerably better than that achieved by the industry. Of course, we ourselves will periodicallyhave a terrible year in insurance. But, overall, I expect us to average an underwriting profit. If so, we will be\nusing free funds of large size for the indefinite future.\nUnderwriting Profit\nYearend Float\n(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2008 2007 2008 2007\nGeneral Re ...................... $ 3 4 2 $ 5 5 5 $21,074 $23,009\nBH Reinsurance .................. 1,324 1,427 24,221 23,692\nGEICO ......................... 9 1 6 1,113 8,454 7,768\nOther Primary ................... 2 1 0 2 7 9 4,739 4,229\n$2,792 $3,374 $58,488 $58,698\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations\nOur activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront.

It’s also noteworthy that these operations used only minor\nfinancial leverage in achieving that return. Clearly we own some terrific businesses. We purchased many ofthem, however, at large premiums to net worth – a point reflected in the goodwill item shown on our balancesheet – and that fact reduces the earnings on our average carrying value to 8.1%.\nThough the full-year result was satisfactory, earnings of many of the businesses in this group hit the\nskids in last year’s fourth quarter. Prospects for 2009 look worse. Nevertheless, the group retains strong earning\npower even under today’s conditions and will continue to deliver significant cash to the parent company. Overall,these companies improved their competitive positions last year, partly because our financial strength let us makeadvantageous tuck-in acquisitions. In contrast, many competitors were treading water (or sinking).\nThe most noteworthy of these acquisitions was Iscar’s late-November purchase of Tungaloy, a leading\nJapanese producer of small tools. Charlie and I continue to look with astonishment – and appreciation! – at theaccomplishments of Iscar’s management. To secure one manager like Eitan Wertheimer, Jacob Harpaz or DannyGoldman when we acquire a company is a blessing. Getting three is like winning the Triple Crown. Iscar’sgrowth since our purchase has exceeded our expectations – which were high – and the addition of Tungaloy willmove performance to the next level.\nMiTek, Benjamin Moore, Acme Brick, Forest River, Marmon and CTB also made one or more\nacquisitions during the year. CTB, which operates worldwide in the agriculture equipment field, has now pickedup six small firms since we purchased it in 2002. At that time, we paid $140 million for the company. Last yearits pre-tax earnings were $89 million. Vic Mancinelli, its CEO, followed Berkshire-like operating principles longbefore our arrival. He focuses on blocking and tackling, day by day doing the little things right and never gettingoff course. Ten years from now, Vic will be running a much larger operation and, more important, will be\nearning excellent returns on invested capital.\nFinance and Financial Products\nI will write here at some length about the mortgage operation of Clayton Homes and skip any financial\ncommentary, which is summarized in the table at the end of this section. I do this because Clayton’s recent\nexperience may be useful in the public-policy debate about housing and mortgages. But first a little background.\nClayton is the largest company in the manufactured home industry, delivering 27,499 units last year.\nThis came to about 34% of the industry’s 81,889 total. Our share will likely grow in 2009, partly because muchof the rest of the industry is in acute distress. Industrywide, units sold have steadily declined since they hit a peakof 372,843 in 1998.\n10\n\nAt that time, much of the industry employed sales practices that were atrocious. Writing about the\nperiod somewhat later, I described it as involving “borrowers who shouldn’t have borrowed being financed by\nlenders who shouldn’t have lent.”\nTo begin with, the need for meaningful down payments was frequently ignored. Sometimes fakery was\ninvolved. (“That certainly looks like a $2,000 cat to me” says the salesman who will receive a $3,000\ncommission if the loan goes through.) Moreover, impossible-to-meet monthly payments were being agreed to byborrowers who signed up because they had nothing to lose. The resulting mortgages were usually packaged\n(“securitized”) and sold by Wall Street firms to unsuspecting investors. This chain of folly had to end badly, andit did.\nClayton, it should be emphasized, followed far more sensible practices in its own lending throughout\nthat time. Indeed, no purchaser of the mortgages it originated and then securitized has ever lost a dime ofprincipal or interest. But Clayton was the exception; industry losses were staggering. And the hangover continuesto this day.\nThis 1997-2000 fiasco should have served as a canary-in-the-coal-mine warning for the far-larger\nconventional housing market. But investors, government and rating agencies learned exactly nothing from themanufactured-home debacle. Instead, in an eerie rerun of that disaster, the same mistakes were repeated withconventional homes in the 2004-07 period: Lenders happily made loans that borrowers couldn’t repay out of theirincomes, and borrowers just as happily signed up to meet those payments. Both parties counted on “house-priceappreciation” to make this otherwise impossible arrangement work. It was Scarlett O’Hara all over again: “I’llthink about it tomorrow.” The consequences of this behavior are now reverberating through every corner of oureconomy.\nClayton’s 198,888 borrowers, however, have continued to pay normally throughout the housing crash,\nhanding us no unexpected losses. This is notbecause these borrowers are unusually creditworthy, a point proved\nby FICO scores (a standard measure of credit risk). Their median FICO score is 644, compared to a national\nmedian of 723, and about 35% are below 620, the segment usually designated “sub-prime.” Many disastrouspools of mortgages on conventional homes are populated by borrowers with far better credit, as measured byFICO scores.\nYet at yearend, our delinquency rate on loans we have originated was 3.6%, up only modestly from\n2.9% in 2006 and 2.9% in 2004. (In addition to our originated loans, we’ve also bought bulk portfolios of varioustypes from other financial institutions.) Clayton’s foreclosures during 2008 were 3.0% of originated loanscompared to 3.8% in 2006 and 5.3% in 2004.\nWhy are our borrowers – characteristically people with modest incomes and far-from-great credit\nscores – performing so well? The answer is elementary, going right back to Lending 101. Our borrowers simplylooked at how full-bore mortgage payments would compare with their actual – not hoped-for – income and thendecided whether they could live with that commitment. Simply put, they took out a mortgage with the intentionof paying it off, whatever the course of home prices.\nJust as important is what our borrowers did notdo. They did not count on making their loan payments\nby means of refinancing. They did not sign up for “teaser” rates that upon reset were outsized relative to theirincome. And they did not assume that they could always sell their home at a profit if their mortgage paymentsbecame onerous. Jimmy Stewart would have loved these folks.\nOf course, a number of our borrowers will run into trouble. They generally have no more than minor\nsavings to tide them over if adversity hits. The major cause of delinquency or foreclosure is the loss of a job, butdeath, divorce and medical expenses all cause problems. If unemployment rates rise – as they surely will in2009 – more of Clayton’s borrowers will have troubles, and we will have larger, though still manageable, losses.But our problems will not be driven to any extent by the trend of home prices.\n11\n\nCommentary about the current housing crisis often ignores the crucial fact that most foreclosures do\nnotoccur because a house is worth less than its mortgage (so-called “upside-down” loans). Rather, foreclosures\ntake place because borrowers can’t pay the monthly payment that they agreed to pay. Homeowners who have\nmade a meaningful down-payment – derived from savings and not from other borrowing – seldom walk away\nfrom a primary residence simply because its value today is less than the mortgage. Instead, they walk when theycan’t make the monthly payments.\nHome ownership is a wonderful thing. My family and I have enjoyed my present home for 50 years,\nwith more to come. But enjoyment and utility should be the primary motives for purchase, not profit or refi\npossibilities. And the home purchased ought to fit the income of the purchaser.\nThe present housing debacle should teach home buyers, lenders, brokers and government some simple\nlessons that will ensure stability in the future. Home purchases should involve an honest-to-God down paymentof at least 10% and monthly payments that can be comfortably handled by the borrower’s income. That incomeshould be carefully verified.\nPutting people into homes, though a desirable goal, shouldn’t be our country’s primary objective.\nKeeping them in their homes should be the ambition.\n************\nClayton’s lending operation, though not damaged by the performance of its borrowers, is nevertheless\nthreatened by an element of the credit crisis. Funders that have access to any sort of government guarantee –banks with FDIC-insured deposits, large entities with commercial paper now backed by the Federal Reserve, andothers who are using imaginative methods (or lobbying skills) to come under the government’s umbrella – havemoney costs that are minimal. Conversely, highly-rated companies, such as Berkshire, are experiencingborrowing costs that, in relation to Treasury rates, are at record levels. Moreover, funds are abundant for thegovernment-guaranteed borrower but often scarce for others, no matter how creditworthy they may be.\nThis unprecedented “spread” in the cost of money makes it unprofitable for any lender who doesn’t\nenjoy government-guaranteed funds to go up against those with a favored status. Government is determining the\n“haves” and “have-nots.” That is why companies are rushing to convert to bank holding companies, not a coursefeasible for Berkshire.\nThough Berkshire’s credit is pristine – we are one of only seven AAA corporations in the country – our\ncost of borrowing is now farhigher than competitors with shaky balance sheets but government backing. At the\nmoment, it is much better to be a financial cripple with a government guarantee than a Gibraltar without one.\nToday’s extreme conditions may soon end. At worst, we believe we will find at least a partial solution\nthat will allow us to continue much of Clayton’s lending. Clayton’s earnings, however, will surely suffer if weare forced to compete for long against government-favored lenders.\nPre-Tax Earnings\n(in millions)\n2008 2007\nNet investment income ....................................... $330 $ 272\nLife and annuity operation .................................... 2 3 (60)\nLeasing operations .......................................... 8 7 1 1 1\nManufactured-housing finance (Clayton) ........................ 2 0 6 5 2 6\nOther* .................................................... 1 4 1 1 5 7\nIncome before investment and derivatives gains or losses ........... $787 $1,006\n*Includes $92 million in 2008 and $85 million in 2007 of fees that Berkshire charges Clayton for the\nuse of Berkshire’s credit.\n12\n\nTax-Exempt Bond Insurance\nEarly in 2008, we activated Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Company (“BHAC”) as an insurer of the\ntax-exempt bonds issued by states, cities and other local entities. BHAC insures these securities for issuers both\nat the time their bonds are sold to the public (primary transactions) and later, when the bonds are already ownedby investors (secondary transactions).\nBy yearend 2007, the half dozen or so companies that had been the major players in this business had\nall fallen into big trouble. The cause of their problems was captured long ago by Mae West: “I was Snow White,\nbut I drifted.”\nThe monolines (as the bond insurers are called) initially insured only tax-exempt bonds that were\nlow-risk. But over the years competition for this business intensified, and rates fell. Faced with the prospect ofstagnating or declining earnings, the monoline managers turned to ever-riskier propositions. Some of theseinvolved the insuring of residential mortgage obligations. When housing prices plummeted, the monolineindustry quickly became a basket case.\nEarly in the year, Berkshire offered to assume all of the insurance issued on tax-exempts that was on\nthe books of the three largest monolines. These companies were all in life-threatening trouble (though they saidotherwise.) We would have charged a 1\n1⁄2% rate to take over the guarantees on about $822 billion of bonds. If\nour offer had been accepted, we would have been required to pay any losses suffered by investors who owned\nthese bonds – a guarantee stretching for 40 years in some cases. Ours was not a frivolous proposal: For reasons\nwe will come to later, it involved substantial risk for Berkshire.\nThe monolines summarily rejected our offer, in some cases appending an insult or two. In the end,\nthough, the turndowns proved to be very good news for us, because it became apparent that I had severely\nunderpriced our offer.\nThereafter, we wrote about $15.6 billion of insurance in the secondary market. And here’s the punch\nline: About 77% of this business was on bonds that were already insured, largely by the three aforementioned\nmonolines. In these agreements, we have to pay for defaults only if the original insurer is financially unable to do\nso.\nWe wrote this “second-to-pay” insurance for rates averaging 3.3%. That’s right; we have been paid far\nmore for becoming the second to pay than the 1.5% we would have earlier charged to be the first to pay. In oneextreme case, we actually agreed to be fourth to pay, nonetheless receiving about three times the 1% premium\ncharged by the monoline that remains first to pay. In other words, three other monolines have to first go broke\nbefore we need to write a check.\nTwo of the three monolines to which we made our initial bulk offer later raised substantial capital.\nThis, of course, directly helps us, since it makes it less likely that we will have to pay, at least in the near term,\nany claims on our second-to-pay insurance because these two monolines fail. In addition to our book ofsecondary business, we have also written $3.7 billion of primary business for a premium of $96 million. Inprimary business, of course, we are first to pay if the issuer gets in trouble.\nWe have a great many more multiples of capital behind the insurance we write than does any other\nmonoline. Consequently, our guarantee is far more valuable than theirs. This explains why many sophisticated\ninvestors have bought second-to-pay insurance from us even though they were already insured by anothermonoline. BHAC has become not only the insurer of preference, but in many cases the soleinsurer acceptable to\nbondholders.\nNevertheless, we remain very cautious about the business we write and regard it as far from a sure\nthing that this insurance will ultimately be profitable for us. The reason is simple, though I have never seen evena passing reference to it by any financial analyst, rating agency or monoline CEO.\n13\n\nThe rationale behind very low premium rates for insuring tax-exempts has been that defaults have\nhistorically been few. But that record largely reflects the experience of entities that issued uninsured bonds.\nInsurance of tax-exempt bonds didn’t exist before 1971, and even after that most bonds remained uninsured.\nA universe of tax-exempts fully covered by insurance would be certain to have a somewhat different\nloss experience from a group of uninsured, but otherwise similar bonds, the only question being how different.\nTo understand why, let’s go back to 1975 when New York City was on the edge of bankruptcy. At the time its\nbonds – virtually all uninsured – were heavily held by the city’s wealthier residents as well as by New York\nbanks and other institutions. These local bondholders deeply desired to solve the city’s fiscal problems. So beforelong, concessions and cooperation from a host of involved constituencies produced a solution. Without one, itwas apparent to all that New York’s citizens and businesses would have experienced widespread and severefinancial losses from their bond holdings.\nNow, imagine that all of the city’s bonds had instead been insured by Berkshire. Would similar belt-\ntightening, tax increases, labor concessions, etc. have been forthcoming? Of course not. At a minimum, Berkshirewould have been asked to “share” in the required sacrifices. And, considering our deep pockets, the requiredcontribution would most certainly have been substantial.\nLocal governments are going to face fartougher fiscal problems in the future than they have to date.\nThe pension liabilities I talked about in last year’s report will be a huge contributor to these woes. Many citiesand states were surely horrified when they inspected the status of their funding at yearend 2008. The gap betweenassets and a realistic actuarial valuation of present liabilities is simply staggering.\nWhen faced with large revenue shortfalls, communities that have all of their bonds insured will be\nmore prone to develop “solutions” less favorable to bondholders than those communities that have uninsuredbonds held by local banks and residents. Losses in the tax-exempt arena, when they come, are also likely to behighly correlated among issuers. If a few communities stiff their creditors and get away with it, the chance that\nothers will follow in their footsteps will grow. What mayor or city council is going to choose pain to localcitizens in the form of major tax increases over pain to a far-away bond insurer?\nInsuring tax-exempts, therefore, has the look today of a dangerous business – one with similarities, in\nfact, to the insuring of natural catastrophes. In both cases, a string of loss-free years can be followed by adevastating experience that more than wipes out all earlier profits. We will try, therefore, to proceed carefully inthis business, eschewing many classes of bonds that other monolines regularly embrace.\n************\nThe type of fallacy involved in projecting loss experience from a universe of non-insured bonds onto a\ndeceptively-similar universe in which many bonds are insured pops up in other areas of finance. “Back-tested”models of many kinds are susceptible to this sort of error. Nevertheless, they are frequently touted in financialmarkets as guides to future action. (If merely looking up past financial data would tell you what the future holds,the Forbes 400 would consist of librarians.)\nIndeed, the stupefying losses in mortgage-related securities came in large part because of flawed,\nhistory-based models used by salesmen, rating agencies and investors. These parties looked at loss experienceover periods when home prices rose only moderately and speculation in houses was negligible. They then madethis experience a yardstick for evaluating future losses. They blissfully ignored the fact that house prices hadrecently skyrocketed, loan practices had deteriorated and many buyers had opted for houses they couldn’t afford.In short, universe “past” and universe “current” had very different characteristics. But lenders, government andmedia largely failed to recognize this all-important fact.\n14\n\nInvestors should be skeptical of history-based models. Constructed by a nerdy-sounding priesthood\nusing esoteric terms such as beta, gamma, sigma and the like, these models tend to look impressive. Too often,\nthough, investors forget to examine the assumptions behind the symbols. Our advice: Beware of geeks bearing\nformulas.\n************\nA final post-script on BHAC: Who, you may wonder, runs this operation? While I help set policy, all\nof the heavy lifting is done by Ajit and his crew. Sure, they were already generating $24 billion of float along\nwith hundreds of millions of underwriting profit annually. But how busy can that keep a 31-person group?Charlie and I decided it was high time for them to start doing a full day’s work.\nInvestments\nBecause of accounting rules, we divide our large holdings of common stocks this year into two\ncategories. The table below, presenting the first category, itemizes investments that are carried on our balance\nsheet at market value and that had a yearend value of more than $500 million.\n12/31/08\nShares\nCompanyPercentage of\nCompany\nOwned Cost* Market\n(in millions)\n151,610,700 American Express Company .................... 13.1 $ 1,287 $ 2,812\n200,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company ....................... 8 . 6 1,299 9,054\n84,896,273 ConocoPhillips ............................... 5 . 7 7,008 4,398\n30,009,591 Johnson & Johnson ........................... 1 . 1 1,847 1,795\n130,272,500 Kraft Foods Inc. .............................. 8 . 9 4,330 3,498\n3,947,554 POSCO ..................................... 5 . 2 7 6 8 1,191\n91,941,010 The Procter & Gamble Company ................. 3 . 1 6 4 3 5,684\n22,111,966 Sanofi-Aventis ............................... 1 . 7 1,827 1,404\n11,262,000 Swiss Re .................................... 3 . 2 7 7 3 5 3 0\n227,307,000 Tesco plc ................................... 2 . 9 1,326 1,193\n75,145,426 U.S. Bancorp ................................ 4 . 3 2,337 1,879\n19,944,300 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. .......................... 0 . 5 9 4 2 1,118\n1,727,765 The Washington Post Company .................. 18.4 11 674\n304,392,068 Wells Fargo & Company ....................... 7 . 2 6,702 8,973\nOthers ...................................... 6,035 4,870\nTotal Common Stocks Carried at Market .......... $37,135 $49,073\n*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP “cost” differs in a few cases because of\nwrite-ups or write-downs that have been required.\nIn addition, we have holdings in Moody’s and Burlington Northern Santa Fe that we now carry at\n“equity value” – our cost plus retained earnings since our purchase, minus the tax that would be paid if those\nearnings were paid to us as dividends. This accounting treatment is usually required when ownership of aninvestee company reaches 20%.\nWe purchased 15% of Moody’s some years ago and have not since bought a share. Moody’s, though,\nhas repurchased its own shares and, by late 2008, those repurchases reduced its outstanding shares to the point\nthat our holdings rose above 20%. Burlington Northern has also repurchased shares, but our increase to 20%primarily occurred because we continued to buy this stock.\n15\n\nUnless facts or rules change, you will see these holdings reflected in our balance sheet at “equity\naccounting” values, whatever their market prices. You will also see our share of their earnings (less applicable\ntaxes) regularly included in our quarterly and annual earnings.\nI told you in an earlier part of this report that last year I made a major mistake of commission (and\nmaybe more; this one sticks out). Without urging from Charlie or anyone else, I bought a large amount of\nConocoPhillips stock when oil and gas prices were near their peak. I in no way anticipated the dramatic fall inenergy prices that occurred in the last half of the year. I still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in\nthe future than the current $40-$50 price. But so far I have been dead wrong. Even if prices should rise,moreover, the terrible timing of my purchase has cost Berkshire several billion dollars.\nI made some other already-recognizable errors as well. They were smaller, but unfortunately not that\nsmall. During 2008, I spent $244 million for shares of two Irish banks that appeared cheap to me. At yearend wewrote these holdings down to market: $27 million, for an 89% loss. Since then, the two stocks have declinedeven further. The tennis crowd would call my mistakes “unforced errors.”\nOn the plus side last year, we made purchases totaling $14.5 billion in fixed-income securities issued\nby Wrigley, Goldman Sachs and General Electric. We very much like these commitments, which carry highcurrent yields that, in themselves, make the investments more than satisfactory. But in each of these threepurchases, we also acquired a substantial equity participation as a bonus. To fund these large purchases, I had tosell portions of some holdings that I would have preferred to keep (primarily Johnson & Johnson, Procter &Gamble and ConocoPhillips). However, I have pledged – to you, the rating agencies and myself – to always runBerkshire with more than ample cash. We never want to count on the kindness of strangers in order to meettomorrow’s obligations. When forced to choose, I will not trade even a night’s sleep for the chance of extraprofits.\nThe investment world has gone from underpricing risk to overpricing it. This change has not been\nminor; the pendulum has covered an extraordinary arc. A few years ago, it would have seemed unthinkable that\nyields like today’s could have been obtained on good-grade municipal or corporate bonds even while risk-freegovernments offered near-zero returns on short-term bonds and no better than a pittance on long-terms. When thefinancial history of this decade is written, it will surely speak of the Internet bubble of the late 1990s and thehousing bubble of the early 2000s. But the U.S. Treasury bond bubble of late 2008 may be regarded as almostequally extraordinary.\nClinging to cash equivalents or long-term government bonds at present yields is almost certainly a\nterrible policy if continued for long. Holders of these instruments, of course, have felt increasingly comfortable –in fact, almost smug – in following this policy as financial turmoil has mounted. They regard their judgmentconfirmed when they hear commentators proclaim “cash is king,” even though that wonderful cash is earningclose to nothing and will surely find its purchasing power eroded over time.\nApproval, though, is not the goal of investing. In fact, approval is often counter-productive because it\nsedates the brain and makes it less receptive to new facts or a re-examination of conclusions formed earlier.Beware the investment activity that produces applause; the great moves are usually greeted by yawns.\nDerivatives\nDerivatives are dangerous. They have dramatically increased the leverage and risks in our financial\nsystem. They have made it almost impossible for investors to understand and analyze our largest commercial\nbanks and investment banks. They allowed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to engage in massive misstatements ofearnings for years. So indecipherable were Freddie and Fannie that their federal regulator, OFHEO, whose morethan 100 employees had no job except the oversight of these two institutions, totally missed their cooking of thebooks.\n16\n\nIndeed, recent events demonstrate that certain big-name CEOs (or former CEOs) at major financial\ninstitutions were simply incapable of managing a business with a huge, complex book of derivatives. Include\nCharlie and me in this hapless group: When Berkshire purchased General Re in 1998, we knew we could not get\nour minds around its book of 23,218 derivatives contracts, made with 884 counterparties (many of which we had\nnever heard of). So we decided to close up shop. Though we were under no pressure and were operating inbenign markets as we exited, it took us five years and more than $400 million in losses to largely complete thetask. Upon leaving, our feelings about the business mirrored a line in a country song: “I liked you better before Igot to know you so well.”\nImproved “transparency” – a favorite remedy of politicians, commentators and financial regulators for\naverting future train wrecks – won’t cure the problems that derivatives pose. I know of no reporting mechanism\nthat would come close to describing and measuring the risks in a huge and complex portfolio of derivatives.Auditors can’t audit these contracts, and regulators can’t regulate them. When I read the pages of “disclosure” in10-Ks of companies that are entangled with these instruments, all I end up knowing is that I don’t know what is\ngoing on in their portfolios (and then I reach for some aspirin).\nFor a case study on regulatory effectiveness, let’s look harder at the Freddie and Fannie example.\nThese giant institutions were created by Congress, which retained control over them, dictating what they couldand could not do. To aid its oversight, Congress created OFHEO in 1992, admonishing it to make sure the twobehemoths were behaving themselves. With that move, Fannie and Freddie became the most intensely-regulatedcompanies of which I am aware, as measured by manpower assigned to the task.\nOn June 15, 2003, OFHEO (whose annual reports are available on the Internet) sent its 2002 report to\nCongress – specifically to its four bosses in the Senate and House, among them none other than Messrs. Sarbanesand Oxley. The report’s 127 pages included a self-congratulatory cover-line: “Celebrating 10 Years ofExcellence.” The transmittal letter and report were delivered nine days after the CEO and CFO of Freddie had\nresigned in disgrace and the COO had been fired. No mention of their departures was made in the letter, even\nwhile the report concluded, as it always did, that “Both Enterprises were financially sound and well managed.”\nIn truth, both enterprises had engaged in massive accounting shenanigans for some time. Finally, in\n2006, OFHEO issued a 340-page scathing chronicle of the sins of Fannie that, more or less, blamed the fiasco onevery party but – you guessed it – Congress and OFHEO.\nThe Bear Stearns collapse highlights the counterparty problem embedded in derivatives transactions, a\ntime bomb I first discussed in Berkshire’s 2002 report. On April 3, 2008, Tim Geithner, then the able president ofthe New York Fed, explained the need for a rescue: “The sudden discovery by Bear’s derivative counterpartiesthat important financial positions they had put in place to protect themselves from financial risk were no longeroperative would have triggered substantial further dislocation in markets. This would have precipitated a rush byBear’s counterparties to liquidate the collateral they held against those positions and to attempt to replicate thosepositions in already very fragile markets.” This is Fedspeak for “We stepped in to avoid a financial chain reactionof unpredictable magnitude.” In my opinion, the Fed was right to do so.\nA normal stock or bond trade is completed in a few days with one party getting its cash, the other its\nsecurities. Counterparty risk therefore quickly disappears, which means credit problems can’t accumulate. Thisrapid settlement process is key to maintaining the integrity of markets. That, in fact, is a reason for NYSE andNASDAQ shortening the settlement period from five days to three days in 1995.\nDerivatives contracts, in contrast, often go unsettled for years, or even decades, with counterparties\nbuilding up huge claims against each other. “Paper” assets and liabilities – often hard to quantify – becomeimportant parts of financial statements though these items will not be validated for many years. Additionally, afrightening web of mutual dependence develops among huge financial institutions. Receivables and payables bythe billions become concentrated in the hands of a few large dealers who are apt to be highly-leveraged in otherways as well. Participants seeking to dodge troubles face the same problem as someone seeking to avoid venerealdisease: It’s not just whom yousleep with, but also whom theyare sleeping with.\n17\n\nSleeping around, to continue our metaphor, can actually be useful for large derivatives dealers because\nit assures them government aid if trouble hits. In other words, only companies having problems that can infect\nthe entire neighborhood – I won’t mention names – are certain to become a concern of the state (an outcome, I’m\nsad to say, that is proper). From this irritating reality comes The First Law of Corporate Survival for ambitious\nCEOs who pile on leverage and run large and unfathomable derivatives books: Modest incompetence simply\nwon’t do; it’s mindboggling screw-ups that are required.\nConsidering the ruin I’ve pictured, you may wonder why Berkshire is a party to 251 derivatives\ncontracts (other than those used for operational purposes at MidAmerican and the few left over at Gen Re). The\nanswer is simple: I believe each contract we own was mispriced at inception, sometimes dramatically so. I bothinitiated these positions and monitor them, a set of responsibilities consistent with my belief that the CEO of anylarge financial organization must be the Chief Risk Officer as well. If we lose money on our derivatives, it will be\nmy fault.\nOur derivatives dealings require our counterparties to make payments to us when contracts are\ninitiated. Berkshire therefore always holds the money, which leaves us assuming no meaningful counterpartyrisk. As of yearend, the payments made to us less losses we have paid – our derivatives “float,” so to speak –totaled $8.1 billion. This float is similar to insurance float: If we break even on an underlying transaction, we willhave enjoyed the use of free money for a long time. Our expectation, though it is far from a sure thing, is that wewill do better than break even and that the substantial investment income we earn on the funds will be frosting onthe cake.\nOnly a small percentage of our contracts call for any posting of collateral when the market moves\nagainst us. Even under the chaotic conditions existing in last year’s fourth quarter, we had to post less than 1% ofour securities portfolio. (When we post collateral, we deposit it with third parties, meanwhile retaining theinvestment earnings on the deposited securities.) In our 2002 annual report, we warned of the lethal threat thatposting requirements create, real-life illustrations of which we witnessed last year at a variety of financial\ninstitutions (and, for that matter, at Constellation Energy, which was within hours of bankruptcy whenMidAmerican arrived to effect a rescue).\nOur contracts fall into four major categories. With apologies to those who are not fascinated by\nfinancial instruments, I will explain them in excruciating detail.\n• We have added modestly to the “equity put” portfolio I described in last year’s report. Some of our\ncontracts come due in 15 years, others in 20. We must make a payment to our counterparty atmaturity if the reference index to which the put is tied is then below what it was at the inception ofthe contract. Neither party can elect to settle early; it’s only the price on the final day that counts.\nTo illustrate, we might sell a $1 billion 15-year put contract on the S&P 500 when that index is at,\nsay, 1300. If the index is at 1170 – down 10% – on the day of maturity, we would pay $100 million.If it is above 1300, we owe nothing. For us to lose $1 billion, the index would have to go to zero. Inthe meantime, the sale of the put would have delivered us a premium – perhaps $100 million to$150 million – that we would be free to invest as we wish.\nOur put contracts total $37.1 billion (at current exchange rates) and are spread among four major\nindices: the S&P 500 in the U.S., the FTSE 100 in the U.K., the Euro Stoxx 50 in Europe, and theNikkei 225 in Japan. Our first contract comes due on September 9, 2019 and our last on January 24,2028. We have received premiums of $4.9 billion, money we have invested. We, meanwhile, havepaid nothing, since all expiration dates are far in the future. Nonetheless, we have used Black-Scholes valuation methods to record a yearend liability of $10 billion, an amount that will changeon every reporting date. The two financial items – this estimated loss of $10 billion minus the $4.9billion in premiums we have received – means that we have so far reported a mark-to-market lossof $5.1 billion from these contracts.\n18\n\nWe endorse mark-to-market accounting. I will explain later, however, why I believe the Black-\nScholes formula, even though it is the standard for establishing the dollar liability for options,produces strange results when the long-term variety are being valued.\nOne point about our contracts that is sometimes not understood: For us to lose the full $37.1 billion\nwe have at risk, all stocks in all four indices would have to go to zero on their various termination\ndates. If, however – as an example – all indices fell 25% from their value at the inception of eachcontract, and foreign-exchange rates remained as they are today, we would owe about $9 billion,\npayable between 2019 and 2028. Between the inception of the contract and those dates, we wouldhave held the $4.9 billion premium and earned investment income on it.\n• The second category we described in last year’s report concerns derivatives requiring us to pay\nwhen credit losses occur at companies that are included in various high-yield indices. Our standardcontract covers a five-year period and involves 100 companies. We modestly expanded our positionlast year in this category. But, of course, the contracts on the books at the end of 2007 moved oneyear closer to their maturity. Overall, our contracts now have an average life of 2\n1⁄3years, with the\nfirst expiration due to occur on September 20, 2009 and the last on December 20, 2013.\nBy yearend we had received premiums of $3.4 billion on these contracts and paid losses of $542\nmillion. Using mark-to-market principles, we also set up a liability for future losses that at yearendtotaled $3.0 billion. Thus we had to that point recorded a loss of about $100 million, derived fromour $3.5 billion total in paid and estimated future losses minus the $3.4 billion of premiums wereceived. In our quarterly reports, however, the amount of gain or loss has swung wildly from a\nprofit of $327 million in the second quarter of 2008 to a loss of $693 million in the fourth quarter of2008.\nSurprisingly, we made payments on these contracts of only $97 million last year, far below the\nestimate I used when I decided to enter into them. This year, however, losses have acceleratedsharply with the mushrooming of large bankruptcies. In last year’s letter, I told you I expected thesecontracts to show a profit at expiration. Now, with the recession deepening at a rapid rate, thepossibility of an eventual loss has increased. Whatever the result, I will keep you posted.\n• In 2008 we began to write “credit default swaps” on individual companies. This is simply credit\ninsurance, similar to what we write in BHAC, except that here we bear the credit risk ofcorporations rather than of tax-exempt issuers.\nIf, say, the XYZ company goes bankrupt, and we have written a $100 million contract, we are\nobligated to pay an amount that reflects the shrinkage in value of a comparable amount of XYZ’sdebt. (If, for example, the company’s bonds are selling for 30 after default, we would owe $70million.) For the typical contract, we receive quarterly payments for five years, after which ourinsurance expires.\nAt yearend we had written $4 billion of contracts covering 42 corporations, for which we receive\nannual premiums of $93 million. This is the only derivatives business we write that has anycounterparty risk; the party that buys the contract from us must be good for the quarterly premiumsit will owe us over the five years. We are unlikely to expand this business to any extent becausemost buyers of this protection now insist that the seller post collateral, and we will not enter intosuch an arrangement.\n• At the request of our customers, we write a few tax-exempt bond insurance contracts that are\nsimilar to those written at BHAC, but that are structured as derivatives. The only meaningfuldifference between the two contracts is that mark-to-market accounting is required for derivativeswhereas standard accrual accounting is required at BHAC.\n19\n\nBut this difference can produce some strange results. The bonds covered – in effect, insured – by\nthese derivatives are largely general obligations of states, and we feel good about them. At yearend,however, mark-to-market accounting required us to record a loss of $631 million on these\nderivatives contracts. Had we instead insured the same bonds at the same price in BHAC, and used\nthe accrual accounting required at insurance companies, we would have recorded a small profit for\nthe year. The two methods by which we insure the bonds will eventually produce the sameaccounting result. In the short term, however, the variance in reported profits can be substantial.\nWe have told you before that our derivative contracts, subject as they are to mark-to-market\naccounting, will produce wild swings in the earnings we report. The ups and downs neither cheer nor bother\nCharlie and me. Indeed, the “downs” can be helpful in that they give us an opportunity to expand a position onfavorable terms. I hope this explanation of our dealings will lead you to think similarly.\n************\nThe Black-Scholes formula has approached the status of holy writ in finance, and we use it when\nvaluing our equity put options for financial statement purposes. Key inputs to the calculation include a contract’smaturity and strike price, as well as the analyst’s expectations for volatility, interest rates and dividends.\nIf the formula is applied to extended time periods, however, it can produce absurd results. In fairness,\nBlack and Scholes almost certainly understood this point well. But their devoted followers may be ignoringwhatever caveats the two men attached when they first unveiled the formula.\nIt’s often useful in testing a theory to push it to extremes. So let’s postulate that we sell a 100- year $1\nbillion put option on the S&P 500 at a strike price of 903 (the index’s level on 12/31/08). Using the impliedvolatility assumption for long-dated contracts that we do, and combining that with appropriate interest anddividend assumptions, we would find the “proper” Black-Scholes premium for this contract to be $2.5 million.\nTo judge the rationality of that premium, we need to assess whether the S&P will be valued a century\nfrom now at less than today. Certainly the dollar will then be worth a small fraction of its present value (at only\n2% inflation it will be worth roughly 14¢). So that will be a factor pushing the stated value of the index higher.Far more important, however, is that one hundred years of retained earnings will hugely increase the value ofmost of the companies in the index. In the 20\nthCentury, the Dow-Jones Industrial Average increased by about\n175-fold, mainly because of this retained-earnings factor.\nConsidering everything, I believe the probability of a decline in the index over a one-hundred-year\nperiod to be farless than 1%. But let’s use that figure and also assume that the most likely decline – should one\noccur – is 50%. Under these assumptions, the mathematical expectation of loss on our contract would be $5\nmillion ($1 billion X 1% X 50%).\nBut if we had received our theoretical premium of $2.5 million up front, we would have only had to\ninvest it at 0.7% compounded annually to cover this loss expectancy. Everything earned above that would have\nbeen profit. Would you like to borrow money for 100 years at a 0.7% rate?\nLet’s look at my example from a worst-case standpoint. Remember that 99% of the time we would pay\nnothing if my assumptions are correct. But even in the worst case among the remaining 1% of possibilities – thatis, one assuming a total loss of $1 billion – our borrowing cost would come to only 6.2%. Clearly, either my\nassumptions are crazy or the formula is inappropriate.\n20\n\nThe ridiculous premium that Black-Scholes dictates in my extreme example is caused by the inclusion\nof volatility in the formula and by the fact that volatility is determined by how much stocks have moved around\nin some past period of days, months or years. This metric is simply irrelevant in estimating the probability-\nweighted range of values of American business 100 years from now. (Imagine, if you will, getting a quote every\nday on a farm from a manic-depressive neighbor and then using the volatility calculated from these changingquotes as an important ingredient in an equation that predicts a probability-weighted range of values for the farma century from now.)\nThough historical volatility is a useful – but far from foolproof – concept in valuing short-term options,\nits utility diminishes rapidly as the duration of the option lengthens. In my opinion, the valuations that the Black-\nScholes formula now place on our long-term put options overstate our liability, though the overstatement willdiminish as the contracts approach maturity.\nEven so, we will continue to use Black-Scholes when we are estimating our financial-statement\nliability for long-term equity puts. The formula represents conventional wisdom and any substitute that I mightoffer would engender extreme skepticism. That would be perfectly understandable: CEOs who have concoctedtheir own valuations for esoteric financial instruments have seldom erred on the side of conservatism. That clubof optimists is one that Charlie and I have no desire to join.\nThe Annual Meeting\nOur meeting this year will be held on Saturday, May 2\nnd. As always, the doors will open at the Qwest\nCenter at 7 a.m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at 8:30. At 9:30 we will go directly to the\nquestion-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest’s stands) will last until 3:00. Then, after\na short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:15. If you decide to leave during the day’s\nquestion periods, please do so while Charlie is talking.\nThe best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We will help you do that by filling the 194,300-square-\nfoot hall that adjoins the meeting area with the products of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, the 31,000 people\nwho came to the meeting did their part, and almost every location racked up record sales. But you can do better.(A friendly warning: If I find sales are lagging, I lock the exits.)\nThis year Clayton will showcase its new i-house that includes Shaw flooring, Johns Manville insulation\nand MiTek fasteners. This innovative “green” home, featuring solar panels and numerous other energy-savingproducts, is truly a home of the future. Estimated costs for electricity and heating total only about $1 per day\nwhen the home is sited in an area like Omaha. After purchasing the i-house , you should next consider the Forest\nRiver RV and pontoon boat on display nearby. Make your neighbors jealous.\nGEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of\nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a\nshareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 50 jurisdictions in which weoperate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that givencertain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. Forat least 50% of you, I believe we can.\nOn Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have the usual array of NetJets aircraft available for your\ninspection. Stop by the NetJets booth at the Qwest to learn about viewing these planes. Come to Omaha by bus;leave in your new plane. And take along – with no fear of a strip search – the Ginsu knives that you’ve purchased\nat the exhibit of our Quikut subsidiary.\nNext, if you have any money left, visit the Bookworm, which will be selling about 30 books and\nDVDs. A shipping service will be available for those whose thirst for knowledge exceeds their carrying capacity.\n21\n\nFinally, we will have three fascinating cars on the exhibition floor, including one from the past and one\nof the future. Paul Andrews, CEO of our subsidiary, TTI, will bring his 1935 Duesenberg, a car that once\nbelonged to Mrs. Forrest Mars, Sr., parent and grandparent of our new partners in the Wrigley purchase. The\nfuture will be represented by a new plug-in electric car developed by BYD, an amazing Chinese company in\nwhich we have a 10% interest.\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. As for plane, hotel and car reservations,\nwe have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. Carol Pedersen, whohandles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it. Hotel rooms can be hard to find,but work with Carol and you will get one.\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72\nndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we\nwill again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. We initiated this special event at NFM twelve years\nago, and sales during the “Weekend” grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to a record $33.3 million in 2008. On\nSaturday of that weekend, we also set a single day record of $7.2 million. Ask any retailer what he thinks of such\nvolume.\nTo obtain the Berkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, April 30th and\nMonday, May 4thinclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even\napply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting\nbut which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their\ncooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday.\nOn Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a western cookout to which you are all invited.\nAt Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception\nfrom 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, May 1st. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 3rd, from 9\na.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m.\nWe will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 27ththrough Saturday, May 9th. During that period,\nplease identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that\nshows you are a Berkshire holder.\nOn Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion,\nwill take on all comers – who will have their eyes wide open – in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, a\nremarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and SharonOsberg, two of the world’s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday\nafternoon.\nGorat’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 3\nrd, and will be\nserving from 1 p.m. until 10 p.m. Last year Gorat’s, which seats 240, served 975 dinners on Shareholder Sunday.\nThe three-day total was 2,448 including 702 T-bone steaks, the entrée preferred by the cognoscenti . Please don’t\nembarrass me by ordering foie gras. Remember: To come to Gorat’s on that day, you must have a reservation. To\nmake one, call 402-551-3733 on April 1st(but not before ).\nWe will again have a reception at 4 p.m. on Saturday afternoon for shareholders who have come from\noutside North America. Every year our meeting draws many people from around the globe, and Charlie and Iwant to be sure we personally greet those who have come so far. Last year we enjoyed meeting more than 700 ofyou from many dozens of countries. Any shareholder who comes from outside the U.S. or Canada will be given aspecial credential and instructions for attending this function.\n************\n22\n\nThis year we will be making important changes in how we handle the meeting’s question periods. In\nrecent years, we have received only a handful of questions directly related to Berkshire and its operations. Last\nyear there were practically none. So we need to steer the discussion back to Berkshire’s businesses.\nIn a related problem, there has been a mad rush when the doors open at 7 a.m., led by people who wish\nto be first in line at the 12 microphones available for questioners. This is not desirable from a safety standpoint,\nnor do we believe that sprinting ability should be the determinant of who gets to pose questions. (At age 78, I’veconcluded that speed afoot is a ridiculously overrated talent.) Again, a new procedure is desirable.\nIn our first change, several financial journalists from organizations representing newspapers,\nmagazines and television will participate in the question-and-answer period, asking Charlie and me questions that\nshareholders have submitted by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune,who may be emailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com,and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com. From the questions submitted,each journalist will choose the dozen or so he or she decides are the most interesting and important. (In youre-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if your question is selected.)\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the\njournalists will pick some tough ones and that’s the way we like it.\nIn our second change, we will have a drawing at 8:15 at each microphone for those shareholders\nhoping to ask questions themselves. At the meeting, I will alternate the questions asked by the journalists withthose from the winning shareholders. At least half the questions – those selected by the panel from yoursubmissions – are therefore certain to be Berkshire-related. We will meanwhile continue to get some good – andperhaps entertaining – questions from the audience as well.\nSo join us at our Woodstock for Capitalists and let us know how you like the new format. Charlie and I\nlook forward to seeing you.\nFebruary 27, 2009 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board\n23",

In this table, Berkshire’s resultsthrough 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculated usingthe numbers originally reported.\nThe S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax . If a corporation such as Berkshire\nwere simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the indexshowed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n2\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nOur gain in net worth during 2009 was $21.8 billion, which increased the per-share book value of both\nour Class A and Class B stock by 19.8%. Over the last 45 years (that is, since present management took over)book value has grown from $19 to $84,487, a rate of 20.3% compounded annually.*\nBerkshire’s recent acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) has added at least 65,000\nshareholders to the 500,000 or so already on our books. It’s important to Charlie Munger, my long-time partner,and me that allof our owners understand Berkshire’s operations, goals, limitations and culture. In each annual\nreport, consequently, we restate the economic principles that guide us. This year these principles appear on pages89-94 and I urge all of you – but particularly our new shareholders – to read them. Berkshire has adhered to theseprinciples for decades and will continue to do so long after I’m gone.\nIn this letter we will also review some of the basics of our business, hoping to provide both a freshman\norientation session for our BNSF newcomers and a refresher course for Berkshire veterans.\nHow We Measure Ourselves\nOur metrics for evaluating our managerial performance are displayed on the facing page. From the start,\nCharlie and I have believed in having a rational and unbending standard for measuring what we have – or havenot – accomplished. That keeps us from the temptation of seeing where the arrow of performance lands and then\npainting the bull’s eye around it.\nSelecting the S&P 500 as our bogey was an easy choice because our shareholders, at virtually no cost, can\nmatch its performance by holding an index fund. Why should they pay us for merely duplicating that result?\nA more difficult decision for us was how to measure the progress of Berkshire versus the S&P. There are\ngood arguments for simply using the change in our stock price. Over an extended period of time, in fact, that isthe best test. But year-to-year market prices can be extraordinarily erratic. Even evaluations covering as long as adecade can be greatly distorted by foolishly high or low prices at the beginning or end of the measurementperiod. Steve Ballmer, of Microsoft, and Jeff Immelt, of GE, can tell you about that problem, suffering as they dofrom the nosebleed prices at which their stocks traded when they were handed the managerial baton.\nThe ideal standard for measuring our yearly progress would be the change in Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic\nvalue. Alas, that value cannot be calculated with anything close to precision, so we instead use a crude proxy forit: per-share book value. Relying on this yardstick has its shortcomings, which we discuss on pages 92 and 93.Additionally, book value at most companies understates intrinsic value, and that is certainly the case atBerkshire. In aggregate, our businesses are worth considerably more than the values at which they are carried onour books. In our all-important insurance business, moreover, the difference is huge. Even so, Charlie and Ibelieve that our book value – understated though it is – supplies the most useful tracking device for changes inintrinsic value. By this measurement, as the opening paragraph of this letter states, our book value since the startof fiscal 1965 has grown at a rate of 20.3% compounded annually.\n*All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are\n1/1500thof those shown for A.\n3\n\nWe should note that had we instead chosen market prices as our yardstick, Berkshire’s results would\nlook better, showing a gain since the start of fiscal 1965 of 22% compounded annually. Surprisingly, this modestdifference in annual compounding rate leads to an 801,516% market-value gain for the entire 45-year periodcompared to the book-value gain of 434,057% (shown on page 2). Our market gain is better because in 1965Berkshire shares sold at an appropriate discount to the book value of its underearning textile assets, whereastoday Berkshire shares regularly sell at a premium to the accounting values of its first-class businesses.\nSummed up, the table on page 2 conveys three messages, two positive and one hugely negative. First,\nwe have never had anyfive-year period beginning with 1965-69 and ending with 2005-09 – and there have been\n41 of these – during which our gain in book value did not exceed the S&P’s gain. Second, though we have laggedthe S&P in some years that were positive for the market, we have consistently done better than the S&P in theeleven years during which it delivered negative results. In other words, our defense has been better than ouroffense, and that’s likely to continue.\nThe big minus is that our performance advantage has shrunk dramatically as our size has grown, an\nunpleasant trend that is certain to continue. To be sure, Berkshire has many outstanding businesses and a cadre of\ntruly great managers, operating within an unusual corporate culture that lets them maximize their talents. Charlieand I believe these factors will continue to produce better-than-average results over time. But huge sums forgetheir own anchor and our future advantage, if any, will be a small fraction of our historical edge.\nWhat We Don’t Do\nLong ago, Charlie laid out his strongest ambition: “All I want to know is where I’m going to die, so I’ll\nnever go there.” That bit of wisdom was inspired by Jacobi, the great Prussian mathematician, who counseled“Invert, always invert” as an aid to solving difficult problems. (I can report as well that this inversion approachworks on a less lofty level: Sing a country song in reverse, and you will quickly recover your car, house andwife.)\nHere are a few examples of how we apply Charlie’s thinking at Berkshire:\n• Charlie and I avoid businesses whose futures we can’t evaluate, no matter how exciting their\nproducts may be. In the past, it required no brilliance for people to foresee the fabulous growththat awaited such industries as autos (in 1910), aircraft (in 1930) and television sets (in 1950). Butthe future then also included competitive dynamics that would decimate almost all of thecompanies entering those industries. Even the survivors tended to come away bleeding.\nJust because Charlie and I can clearly see dramatic growth ahead for an industry does not mean\nwe can judge what its profit margins and returns on capital will be as a host of competitors battlefor supremacy. At Berkshire we will stick with businesses whose profit picture for decades tocome seems reasonably predictable. Even then, we will make plenty of mistakes.\n• We will never become dependent on the kindness of strangers. Too-big-to-fail is not a fallback\nposition at Berkshire. Instead, we will always arrange our affairs so that any requirements for cashwe may conceivably have will be dwarfed by our own liquidity. Moreover, that liquidity will beconstantly refreshed by a gusher of earnings from our many and diverse businesses.\nWhen the financial system went into cardiac arrest in September 2008, Berkshire was a supplier\nof liquidity and capital to the system, not a supplicant. At the very peak of the crisis, we poured$15.5 billion into a business world that could otherwise look only to the federal government forhelp. Of that, $9 billion went to bolster capital at three highly-regarded and previously-secureAmerican businesses that needed – without delay – our tangible vote of confidence. The remaining\n$6.5 billion satisfied our commitment to help fund the purchase of Wrigley, a deal that wascompleted without pause while, elsewhere, panic reigned.\n4\n\nWe pay a steep price to maintain our premier financial strength. The $20 billion-plus of cash-\nequivalent assets that we customarily hold is earning a pittance at present. But we sleep well.\n• We tend to let our many subsidiaries operate on their own, without our supervising and\nmonitoring them to any degree. That means we are sometimes late in spotting managementproblems and that both operating and capital decisions are occasionally made with which Charlieand I would have disagreed had we been consulted. Most of our managers, however, use theindependence we grant them magnificently, rewarding our confidence by maintaining an owner-oriented attitude that is invaluable and too seldom found in huge organizations. We would rathersuffer the visible costs of a few bad decisions than incur the many invisible costs that come fromdecisions made too slowly – or not at all – because of a stifling bureaucracy.\nWith our acquisition of BNSF, we now have about 257,000 employees and literally hundreds of\ndifferent operating units. We hope to have many more of each. But we will never allow Berkshireto become some monolith that is overrun with committees, budget presentations and multiplelayers of management. Instead, we plan to operate as a collection of separately-managed medium-sized and large businesses, most of whose decision-making occurs at the operating level. Charlieand I will limit ourselves to allocating capital, controlling enterprise risk, choosing managers andsetting their compensation.\n• We make no attempt to woo Wall Street. Investors who buy and sell based upon media or analyst\ncommentary are not for us. Instead we want partners who join us at Berkshire because they wish\nto make a long-term investment in a business they themselves understand and because it’s one that\nfollows policies with which they concur. If Charlie and I were to go into a small venture with afew partners, we would seek individuals in sync with us, knowing that common goals and a shareddestiny make for a happy business “marriage” between owners and managers. Scaling up to giantsize doesn’t change that truth.\nTo build a compatible shareholder population, we try to communicate with our owners directly\nand informatively. Our goal is to tell you what we would like to know if our positions werereversed. Additionally, we try to post our quarterly and annual financial information on theInternet early on weekends, thereby giving you and other investors plenty of time during anon-trading period to digest just what has happened at our multi-faceted enterprise. (Occasionally,SEC deadlines force a non-Friday disclosure.) These matters simply can’t be adequatelysummarized in a few paragraphs, nor do they lend themselves to the kind of catchy headline thatjournalists sometimes seek.\nLast year we saw, in one instance, how sound-bite reporting can go wrong. Among the 12,830\nwords in the annual letter was this sentence: “We are certain, for example, that the economy willbe in shambles throughout 2009 – and probably well beyond – but that conclusion does not tell uswhether the market will rise or fall.” Many news organizations reported – indeed, blared – the firstpart of the sentence while making no mention whatsoever of its ending. I regard this as terriblejournalism: Misinformed readers or viewers may well have thought that Charlie and I wereforecasting bad things for the stock market, though we had not only in that sentence, but alsoelsewhere, made it clear we weren’t predicting the market at all. Any investors who were misledby the sensationalists paid a big price: The Dow closed the day of the letter at 7,063 and finishedthe year at 10,428.\nGiven a few experiences we’ve had like that, you can understand why I prefer that our\ncommunications with you remain as direct and unabridged as possible.\n************\nLet’s move to the specifics of Berkshire’s operations. We have four major operating sectors, each\ndiffering from the others in balance sheet and income account characteristics. Therefore, lumping them together,as is standard in financial statements, impedes analysis. So we’ll present them as four separate businesses, whichis how Charlie and I view them.\n5\n\nInsurance\nOur property-casualty (P/C) insurance business has been the engine behind Berkshire’s growth and will\ncontinue to be. It has worked wonders for us. We carry our P/C companies on our books at $15.5 billion morethan their net tangible assets, an amount lodged in our “Goodwill” account. These companies, however, areworth farmore than their carrying value – and the following look at the economic model of the P/C industry will\ntell you why.\nInsurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from\ncertain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-now, pay-later modelleaves us holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, we get toinvest this float for Berkshire’s benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of floatwe hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so doesour float.\nIf premiums exceed the total of expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit that\nadds to the investment income produced from the float. This combination allows us to enjoy the use of freemoney – and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Alas, the hope of this happy result attracts intense competition,\nso vigorous in most years as to cause the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss.\nThis loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Usually this cost is fairly low, but in somecatastrophe-ridden years the cost from underwriting losses more than eats up the income derived from use offloat.\nIn my perhaps biased view, Berkshire has the best large insurance operation in the world. And I will\nabsolutely state that we have the best managers. Our float has grown from $16 million in 1967, when we enteredthe business, to $62 billion at the end of 2009. Moreover, we have now operated at an underwriting profit forseven consecutive years. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwrite profitably in most – thoughcertainly not all – future years. If we do so, our float will be cost-free, much as if someone deposited $62 billionwith us that we could invest for our own benefit without the payment of interest.\nLet me emphasize again that cost-free float is nota result to be expected for the P/C industry as a\nwhole: In most years, premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, theindustry’s overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of that achieved by the S&P500. Outstanding economics exist at Berkshire only because we have some outstanding managers running someunusual businesses. Our insurance CEOs deserve your thanks, having added many billions of dollars toBerkshire’s value. It’s a pleasure for me to tell you about these all-stars.\n************\nLet’s start at GEICO, which is known to all of you because of its $800 million annual advertising\nbudget (close to twice that of the runner-up advertiser in the auto insurance field). GEICO is managed by TonyNicely, who joined the company at 18. Now 66, Tony still tap-dances to the office every day, just as I do at 79.We both feel lucky to work at a business we love.\nGEICO’s customers have warm feelings toward the company as well. Here’s proof: Since Berkshire\nacquired control of GEICO in 1996, its market share has increased from 2.5% to 8.1%, a gain reflecting the netaddition of seven million policyholders. Perhaps they contacted us because they thought our gecko was cute, butthey bought from us to save important money. (Maybe you can as well; call 1-800-847-7536 or go towww.GEICO.com.) And they’ve stayed with us because they like our service as well as our price.\nBerkshire acquired GEICO in two stages. In 1976-80 we bought about one-third of the company’s\nstock for $47 million. Over the years, large repurchases by the company of its own shares caused our position togrow to about 50% without our having bought any more shares. Then, on January 2, 1996, we acquired theremaining 50% of GEICO for $2.3 billion in cash, about 50 times the cost of our original purchase.\n6\n\nAn old Wall Street joke gets close to our experience:\nCustomer: Thanks for putting me in XYZ stock at 5. I hear it’s up to 18.Broker: Yes, and that’s just the beginning. In fact, the company is doing so well now,\nthat it’s an even better buy at 18 than it was when you made your purchase.\nCustomer: Damn, I knew I should have waited.GEICO’s growth may slow in 2010. U.S. vehicle registrations are actually down because of slumping\nauto sales. Moreover, high unemployment is causing a growing number of drivers to go uninsured. (That’s illegalalmost everywhere, but if you’ve lost your job and still want to drive . . .) Our “low-cost producer” status,however, is sure to give us significant gains in the future. In 1995, GEICO was the country’s sixth largest autoinsurer; now we are number three. The company’s float has grown from $2.7 billion to $9.6 billion. Equallyimportant, GEICO has operated at an underwriting profit in 13 of the 14 years Berkshire has owned it.\nI became excited about GEICO in January 1951, when I first visited the company as a 20-year-old\nstudent. Thanks to Tony, I’m even more excited today.\n************\nA hugely important event in Berkshire’s history occurred on a Saturday in 1985. Ajit Jain came into\nour office in Omaha – and I immediately knew we had found a superstar. (He had been discovered by MikeGoldberg, now elevated to St. Mike.)\nWe immediately put Ajit in charge of National Indemnity’s small and struggling reinsurance operation.\nOver the years, he has built this business into a one-of-a-kind giant in the insurance world.\nStaffed today by only 30 people, Ajit’s operation has set records for transaction size in several areas of\ninsurance. Ajit writes billion-dollar limits – and then keeps every dime of the risk instead of laying it off withother insurers. Three years ago, he took over huge liabilities from Lloyds, allowing it to clean up its relationshipwith 27,972 participants (“names”) who had written problem-ridden policies that at one point threatened thesurvival of this 322-year-old institution. The premium for that single contract was $7.1 billion. During 2009, henegotiated a life reinsurance contract that could produce $50 billion of premium for us over the next 50 or soyears.\nAjit’s business is just the opposite of GEICO’s. At that company, we have millions of small policies\nthat largely renew year after year. Ajit writes relatively few policies, and the mix changes significantly from yearto year. Throughout the world, he is known as the man to call when something both very large and unusual needsto be insured.\nIf Charlie, I and Ajit are ever in a sinking boat – and you can only save one of us – swim to Ajit.\n************\nOur third insurance powerhouse is General Re. Some years back this operation was troubled; now it is\na gleaming jewel in our insurance crown.\nUnder the leadership of Tad Montross, General Re had an outstanding underwriting year in 2009, while\nalso delivering us unusually large amounts of float per dollar of premium volume. Alongside General Re’s P/Cbusiness, Tad and his associates have developed a major life reinsurance operation that has grown increasinglyvaluable.\nLast year General Re finally attained 100% ownership of Cologne Re, which since 1995 has been a\nkey – though only partially-owned – part of our presence around the world. Tad and I will be visiting Cologne inSeptember to thank its managers for their important contribution to Berkshire.\n7\n\nFinally, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them specializing in odd corners of the\ninsurance world. In aggregate, their results have consistently been profitable and, as the table below shows, thefloat they provide us is substantial. Charlie and I treasure these companies and their managers.\nHere is the record of all four segments of our property-casualty and life insurance businesses:\nUnderwriting Profit\nYearend Float\n(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2009 2008 2009 2008\nGeneral Re ...................... $ 4 7 7 $ 3 4 2 $21,014 $21,074\nBH Reinsurance .................. 3 4 9 1,324 26,223 24,221\nGEICO ......................... 6 4 9 9 1 6 9,613 8,454\nOther Primary ................... 8 4 2 1 0 5,061 4,739\n$1,559 $2,792 $61,911 $58,488\n************\nAnd now a painful confession: Last year your chairman closed the book on a very expensive business\nfiasco entirely of his own making.\nFor many years I had struggled to think of side products that we could offer our millions of loyal\nGEICO customers. Unfortunately, I finally succeeded, coming up with a brilliant insight that we should marketour own credit card. I reasoned that GEICO policyholders were likely to be good credit risks and, assuming weoffered an attractive card, would likely favor us with their business. We got business all right – but of the wrongtype.\nOur pre-tax losses from credit-card operations came to about $6.3 million before I finally woke up. We\nthen sold our $98 million portfolio of troubled receivables for 55¢ on the dollar, losing an additional $44 million.\nGEICO’s managers, it should be emphasized, were never enthusiastic about my idea. They warned me\nthat instead of getting the cream of GEICO’s customers we would get the ––––– well, let’s call it the\nnon-cream. I subtly indicated that I was older and wiser.\nI was just older.\nRegulated Utility Business\nBerkshire has an 89.5% interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which owns a wide variety of\nutility operations. The largest of these are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, whose 3.8 million endusers make it the U.K.’s third largest distributor of electricity; (2) MidAmerican Energy, which serves 725,000electric customers, primarily in Iowa; (3) Pacific Power and Rocky Mountain Power, serving about 1.7 millionelectric customers in six western states; and (4) Kern River and Northern Natural pipelines, which carry about8% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S.\nMidAmerican has two terrific managers, Dave Sokol and Greg Abel. In addition, my long-time friend,\nWalter Scott, along with his family, has a major ownership position in the company. Walter brings extraordinarybusiness savvy to anyoperation. Ten years of working with Dave, Greg and Walter have reinforced my original\nbelief: Berkshire couldn’t have better partners. They are truly a dream team.\nSomewhat incongruously, MidAmerican also owns the second largest real estate brokerage firm in the\nU.S., HomeServices of America. This company operates through 21 locally-branded firms that have 16,000agents. Though last year was again a terrible year for home sales, HomeServices earned a modest sum. It alsoacquired a firm in Chicago and will add other quality brokerage operations when they are available at sensibleprices. A decade from now, HomeServices is likely to be much larger.\n8\n\nHere are some key figures on MidAmerican’s operations:\nEarnings (in millions)\n2009 2008\nU.K. utilities ............................................................ $ 2 4 8 $ 3 3 9\nIowa utility ............................................................. 2 8 5 4 2 5\nWestern utilities ......................................................... 7 8 8 7 0 3\nPipelines ............................................................... 4 5 7 5 9 5\nHomeServices ........................................................... 4 3 (45)\nOther (net) .............................................................. 2 5 1 8 6\nOperating earnings before corporate interest and taxes ........................... 1,846 2,203\nConstellation Energy * .................................................... — 1,092\nInterest, other than to Berkshire .............................................

Permitting and construction periods for generation and major transmission facilitiesstretch way out, so it is incumbent on us to be far-sighted. We, in turn, look to our utilities’ regulators (acting onbehalf of our customers) to allow us an appropriate return on the huge amounts of capital we must deploy to meetfuture needs. We shouldn’t expect our regulators to live up to their end of the bargain unless we live up to ours.\nDave and Greg make sure we do just that. National research companies consistently rank our Iowa and\nWestern utilities at or near the top of their industry. Similarly, among the 43 U.S. pipelines ranked by a firmnamed Mastio, our Kern River and Northern Natural properties tied for second place.\nMoreover, we continue to pour huge sums of money into our operations so as to not only prepare for\nthe future but also make these operations more environmentally friendly. Since we purchased MidAmerican tenyears ago, it has never paid a dividend. We have instead used earnings to improve and expand our properties in\neach of the territories we serve. As one dramatic example, in the last three years our Iowa and Western utilitieshave earned $2.5 billion, while in this same period spending $3 billion on wind generation facilities.\nMidAmerican has consistently kept its end of the bargain with society and, to society’s credit, it has\nreciprocated: With few exceptions, our regulators have promptly allowed us to earn a fair return on the ever-increasing sums of capital we must invest. Going forward, we will do whatever it takes to serve our territories inthe manner they expect. We believe that, in turn, we will be allowed the return we deserve on the funds weinvest.\nIn earlier days, Charlie and I shunned capital-intensive businesses such as public utilities. Indeed, the\nbest businesses by far for owners continue to be those that have high returns on capital and that require littleincremental investment to grow. We are fortunate to own a number of such businesses, and we would love to buymore. Anticipating, however, that Berkshire will generate ever-increasing amounts of cash, we are today quitewilling to enter businesses that regularly require large capital expenditures. We expect only that these businesseshave reasonable expectations of earning decent returns on the incremental sums they invest. If our expectationsare met – and we believe that they will be – Berkshire’s ever-growing collection of good to great businessesshould produce above-average, though certainly not spectacular, returns in the decades ahead.\n9\n\nOur BNSF operation, it should be noted, has certain important economic characteristics that resemble\nthose of our electric utilities. In both cases we provide fundamental services that are, and will remain, essential tothe economic well-being of our customers, the communities we serve, and indeed the nation. Both will requireheavy investment that greatly exceeds depreciation allowances for decades to come. Both must also plan farahead to satisfy demand that is expected to outstrip the needs of the past. Finally, both require wise regulatorswho will provide certainty about allowable returns so that we can confidently make the huge investmentsrequired to maintain, replace and expand the plant.\nWe see a “social compact” existing between the public and our railroad business, just as is the case\nwith our utilities. If either side shirks its obligations, both sides will inevitably suffer. Therefore, both parties tothe compact should – and we believe will – understand the benefit of behaving in a way that encourages goodbehavior by the other. It is inconceivable that our country will realize anything close to its full economicpotential without its possessing first-class electricity and railroad systems. We will do our part to see that theyexist.\nIn the future, BNSF results will be included in this “regulated utility” section. Aside from the two\nbusinesses having similar underlying economic characteristics, both are logical users of substantial amounts ofdebt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Both will retain most of their earnings. Both will earn and invest large\nsums in good times or bad, though the railroad will display the greater cyclicality. Overall, we expect thisregulated sector to deliver significantly increased earnings over time, albeit at the cost of our investing many tens– yes, tens – of billions of dollars of incremental equity capital.\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations\nOur activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront. Let’s look, though, at a summary balance\nsheet and earnings statement for the entire group.\nBalance Sheet 12/31/09 (in millions)\nAssetsCash and equivalents ................. $ 3,018\nAccounts and notes receivable .......... 5,066\nInventory .......................... 6,147\nOther current assets .................. 6 2 5\nTotal current assets ................... 14,856\nGoodwill and other intangibles ......... 16,499\nFixed assets ........................ 15,374\nOther assets ........................ 2,070\n$48,799Liabilities and Equity\nNotes payable ....................... $ 1,842\nOther current liabilities ............... 7,414\nTotal current liabilities ................ 9,256\nDeferred taxes ...................... 2,834\nTerm debt and other liabilities .......... 6,240\nEquity ............................. 30,469\n$48,799\nEarnings Statement (in millions)\n2009 2008 2007\nRevenues ......................................................... $61,665 $66,099 $59,100\nOperating expenses (including depreciation of $1,422 in 2009, $1,280 in 2008\nand $955 in 2007) ................................................. 59,509 61,937 55,026\nInterest expense .................................................... 9 8 1 3 9 1 2 7\nPre-tax earnings .................................................... 2,058* 4,023* 3,947*\nIncome taxes and minority interests ..................................... 9 4 5 1,740 1,594\nNet income ........................................................ $ 1,113 $ 2,283 $ 2,353\n*Does not include purchase-accounting adjustments.\n10\n\nAlmost all of the many and widely-diverse operations in this sector suffered to one degree or another\nfrom 2009’s severe recession. The major exception was McLane, our distributor of groceries, confections andnon-food items to thousands of retail outlets, the largest by far Wal-Mart.\nGrady Rosier led McLane to record pre-tax earnings of $344 million, which even so amounted to only\nslightly more than one cent per dollar on its huge sales of $31.2 billion. McLane employs a vast array of physicalassets – practically all of which it owns – including 3,242 trailers, 2,309 tractors and 55 distribution centers with15.2 million square feet of space. McLane’s prime asset, however, is Grady.\nWe had a number of companies at which profits improved even as sales contracted, always an\nexceptional managerial achievement. Here are the CEOs who made it happen:\nCOMPANY\nCEO\nBenjamin Moore (paint) Denis Abrams\nBorsheims (jewelry retailing) Susan JacquesH. H. Brown (manufacturing and retailing of shoes) Jim IsslerCTB (agricultural equipment) Vic MancinelliDairy Queen John GainorNebraska Furniture Mart (furniture retailing) Ron and Irv BlumkinPampered Chef (direct sales of kitchen tools) Marla GottschalkSee’s (manufacturing and retailing of candy) Brad KinstlerStar Furniture (furniture retailing) Bill Kimbrell\nAmong the businesses we own that have major exposure to the depressed industrial sector, both\nMarmon and Iscar turned in relatively strong performances. Frank Ptak’s Marmon delivered a 13.5% pre-taxprofit margin, a record high. Though the company’s sales were down 27%, Frank’s cost-conscious managementmitigated the decline in earnings.\nNothing stops Israel-based Iscar – not wars, recessions or competitors. The world’s two other leading\nsuppliers of small cutting tools both had very difficult years, each operating at a loss throughout much of theyear. Though Iscar’s results were down significantly from 2008, the company regularly reported profits, evenwhile it was integrating and rationalizing Tungaloy, the large Japanese acquisition that we told you about lastyear. When manufacturing rebounds, Iscar will set new records. Its incredible managerial team of EitanWertheimer, Jacob Harpaz and Danny Goldman will see to that.\nEvery business we own that is connected to residential and commercial construction suffered severely\nin 2009. Combined pre-tax earnings of Shaw, Johns Manville, Acme Brick, and MiTek were $227 million, an82.5% decline from $1.295 billion in 2006, when construction activity was booming. These businesses continueto bump along the bottom, though their competitive positions remain undented.\nThe major problem for Berkshire last year was NetJets, an aviation operation that offers fractional\nownership of jets. Over the years, it has been enormously successful in establishing itself as the premier companyin its industry, with the value of its fleet far exceeding that of its three major competitors combined . Overall, our\ndominance in the field remains unchallenged.\nNetJets’ business operation, however, has been another story. In the eleven years that we have owned\nthe company, it has recorded an aggregate pre-tax loss of $157 million. Moreover, the company’s debt has soaredfrom $102 million at the time of purchase to $1.9 billion in April of last year. Without Berkshire’s guarantee ofthis debt, NetJets would have been out of business. It’s clear that I failed you in letting NetJets descend into thiscondition. But, luckily, I have been bailed out.\n11\n\nDave Sokol, the enormously talented builder and operator of MidAmerican Energy, became CEO of\nNetJets in August. His leadership has been transforming: Debt has already been reduced to $1.4 billion, and, aftersuffering a staggering loss of $711 million in 2009, the company is now solidly profitable.\nMost important, none of the changes wrought by Dave have in any way undercut the top-of-the-line\nstandards for safety and service that Rich Santulli, NetJets’ previous CEO and the father of the fractional-ownership industry, insisted upon. Dave and I have the strongest possible personal interest in maintaining thesestandards because we and our families use NetJets for almost all of our flying, as do many of our directors andmanagers. None of us are assigned special planes nor crews. We receive exactly the same treatment as any otherowner, meaning we pay the same prices as everyone else does when we are using our personal contracts. In short,we eat our own cooking. In the aviation business, no other testimonial means more.\nFinance and Financial Products\nOur largest operation in this sector is Clayton Homes, the country’s leading producer of modular and\nmanufactured homes. Clayton was not always number one: A decade ago the three leading manufacturers wereFleetwood, Champion and Oakwood, which together accounted for 44% of the output of the industry. All havesince gone bankrupt. Total industry output, meanwhile, has fallen from 382,000 units in 1999 to 60,000 units in2009.\nThe industry is in shambles for two reasons, the first of which must be lived with if the U.S. economy\nis to recover. This reason concerns U.S. housing starts (including apartment units). In 2009, starts were 554,000,by far the lowest number in the 50 years for which we have data. Paradoxically, this is good news.\nPeople thought it was good news a few years back when housing starts – the supply side of the picture\n– were running about two million annually. But household formations – the demand side – only amounted toabout 1.2 million. After a few years of such imbalances, the country unsurprisingly ended up with far too manyhouses.\nThere were three ways to cure this overhang: (1) blow up a lot of houses, a tactic similar to the\ndestruction of autos that occurred with the “cash-for-clunkers” program; (2) speed up household formations by,say, encouraging teenagers to cohabitate, a program not likely to suffer from a lack of volunteers or; (3) reducenew housing starts to a number far below the rate of household formations.\nOur country has wisely selected the third option, which means that within a year or so residential\nhousing problems should largely be behind us, the exceptions being only high-value houses and those in certainlocalities where overbuilding was particularly egregious. Prices will remain far below “bubble” levels, of course,but for every seller (or lender) hurt by this there will be a buyer who benefits. Indeed, many families that couldn’tafford to buy an appropriate home a few years ago now find it well within their means because the bubble burst.\nThe second reason that manufactured housing is troubled is specific to the industry: the punitive\ndifferential in mortgage rates between factory-built homes and site-built homes. Before you read further, let meunderscore the obvious: Berkshire has a dog in this fight, and you should therefore assess the commentary thatfollows with special care. That warning made, however, let me explain why the rate differential causes problemsfor both large numbers of lower-income Americans and Clayton.\nThe residential mortgage market is shaped by government rules that are expressed by FHA, Freddie\nMac and Fannie Mae. Their lending standards are all-powerful because the mortgages they insure can typicallybe securitized and turned into what, in effect, is an obligation of the U.S. government. Currently buyers ofconventional site-built homes who qualify for these guarantees can obtain a 30-year loan at about 5\n1⁄4%. In\naddition, these are mortgages that have recently been purchased in massive amounts by the Federal Reserve, anaction that also helped to keep rates at bargain-basement levels.\nIn contrast, very few factory-built homes qualify for agency-insured mortgages. Therefore, a\nmeritorious buyer of a factory-built home must pay about 9% on his loan. For the all-cash buyer, Clayton’shomes offer terrific value. If the buyer needs mortgage financing, however – and, of course, most buyers do – thedifference in financing costs too often negates the attractive price of a factory-built home.\n12\n\nLast year I told you why our buyers – generally people with low incomes – performed so well as credit\nrisks. Their attitude was all-important: They signed up to live in the home, not resell or refinance it.Consequently, our buyers usually took out loans with payments geared to their verified incomes (we weren’tmaking “liar’s loans”) and looked forward to the day they could burn their mortgage. If they lost their jobs, hadhealth problems or got divorced, we could of course expect defaults. But they seldom walked away simplybecause house values had fallen. Even today, though job-loss troubles have grown, Clayton’s delinquencies anddefaults remain reasonable and will not cause us significant problems.\nWe have tried to qualify more of our customers’ loans for treatment similar to those available on the\nsite-built product. So far we have had only token success. Many families with modest incomes but responsiblehabits have therefore had to forego home ownership simply because the financing differential attached to thefactory-built product makes monthly payments too expensive. If qualifications aren’t broadened, so as to openlow-cost financing to allwho meet down-payment and income standards, the manufactured-home industry seems\ndestined to struggle and dwindle.\nEven under these conditions, I believe Clayton will operate profitably in coming years, though well\nbelow its potential. We couldn’t have a better manager than CEO Kevin Clayton, who treats Berkshire’s interestsas if they were his own. Our product is first-class, inexpensive and constantly being improved. Moreover, we willcontinue to use Berkshire’s credit to support Clayton’s mortgage program, convinced as we are of its soundness.Even so, Berkshire can’t borrow at a rate approaching that available to government agencies. This handicap willlimit sales, hurting both Clayton and a multitude of worthy families who long for a low-cost home.\nIn the following table, Clayton’s earnings are net of the company’s payment to Berkshire for the use of\nits credit. Offsetting this cost to Clayton is an identical amount of income credited to Berkshire’s financeoperation and included in “Other Income.” The cost and income amount was $116 million in 2009 and $92million in 2008.\nThe table also illustrates how severely our furniture (CORT) and trailer (XTRA) leasing operations\nhave been hit by the recession. Though their competitive positions remain as strong as ever, we have yet to seeany bounce in these businesses.\nPre-Tax Earnings\n(in millions)\n2009 2008\nNet investment income ....................................... $278 $330\nLife and annuity operation .................................... 1 1 6 2 3\nLeasing operations .......................................... 1 4 8 7\nManufactured-housing finance (Clayton) ........................ 1 8 7 2 0 6\nOther income * ............................................. 1 8 6 1 4 1\nIncome before investment and derivatives gains or losses ........... $781 $787\n*Includes $116 million in 2009 and $92 million in 2008 of fees that Berkshire charges Clayton for the\nuse of Berkshire’s credit.\n************\nAt the end of 2009, we became a 50% owner of Berkadia Commercial Mortgage (formerly known as\nCapmark), the country’s third-largest servicer of commercial mortgages. In addition to servicing a $235 billionportfolio, the company is an important originator of mortgages, having 25 offices spread around the country.Though commercial real estate will face major problems in the next few years, long-term opportunities forBerkadia are significant.\n13\n\nOur partner in this operation is Leucadia, run by Joe Steinberg and Ian Cumming, with whom we had a\nterrific experience some years back when Berkshire joined with them to purchase Finova, a troubled financebusiness. In resolving that situation, Joe and Ian did far more than their share of the work, an arrangement Ialways encourage. Naturally, I was delighted when they called me to partner again in the Capmark purchase.\nOur first venture was also christened Berkadia. So let’s call this one Son of Berkadia. Someday I’ll be\nwriting you about Grandson of Berkadia.\nInvestments\nBelow we show our common stock investments that at yearend had a market value of more than $1 billion.\n12/31/09\nShares\nCompanyPercentage of\nCompany\nOwned Cost * Market\n(in millions)\n151,610,700 American Express Company ........................ 12.7 $ 1,287 $ 6,143\n225,000,000 BYD Company, Ltd. .............................. 9 . 9 2 3 2 1,986\n200,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company .......................... 8 . 6 1,299 11,400\n37,711,330 ConocoPhillips .................................. 2 . 5 2,741 1,926\n28,530,467 Johnson & Johnson ............................... 1 . 0 1,724 1,838\n130,272,500 Kraft Foods Inc. ................................. 8 . 8 4,330 3,541\n3,947,554 POSCO ........................................ 5 . 2 7 6 8 2,092\n83,128,411 The Procter & Gamble Company .................... 2 . 9 5 3 3 5,040\n25,108,967 Sanofi-Aventis .................................. 1 . 9 2,027 1,979\n234,247,373 Tesco plc ....................................... 3 . 0 1,367 1,620\n76,633,426 U.S. Bancorp .................................... 4 . 0 2,371 1,725\n39,037,142 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ............................. 1 . 0 1,893 2,087\n334,235,585 Wells Fargo & Company .......................... 6 . 5 7,394 9,021\nOthers ......................................... 6,680 8,636\nTotal Common Stocks Carried at Market .............. $34,646 $59,034\n*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP “cost” differs in a few cases because of\nwrite-ups or write-downs that have been required.\nIn addition, we own positions in non-traded securities of Dow Chemical, General Electric, Goldman\nSachs, Swiss Re and Wrigley with an aggregate cost of $21.1 billion and a carrying value of $26.0 billion. Wepurchased these five positions in the last 18 months. Setting aside the significant equity potential they provide us,these holdings deliver us an aggregate of $2.1 billion annually in dividends and interest. Finally, we owned76,777,029 shares (22.5%) of BNSF at yearend, which we then carried at $85.78 per share, but which havesubsequently been melded into our purchase of the entire company.\nIn 2009, our largest sales were in ConocoPhillips, Moody’s, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson\n(sales of the latter occurring after we had built our position earlier in the year). Charlie and I believe that all ofthese stocks will likely trade higher in the future. We made some sales early in 2009 to raise cash for our Dowand Swiss Re purchases and late in the year made other sales in anticipation of our BNSF purchase.\n14\n\nWe told you last year that very unusual conditions then existed in the corporate and municipal bond\nmarkets and that these securities were ridiculously cheap relative to U.S. Treasuries. We backed this view withsome purchases, but I should have done far more. Big opportunities come infrequently. When it’s raining gold,reach for a bucket, not a thimble.\nWe entered 2008 with $44.3 billion of cash-equivalents, and we have since retained operating earnings\nof $17 billion. Nevertheless, at yearend 2009, our cash was down to $30.6 billion (with $8 billion earmarked forthe BNSF acquisition). We’ve put a lot of money to work during the chaos of the last two years. It’s been anideal period for investors: A climate of fear is their best friend. Those who invest only when commentators areupbeat end up paying a heavy price for meaningless reassurance. In the end, what counts in investing is what youpay for a business – through the purchase of a small piece of it in the stock market – and what that business earnsin the succeeding decade or two.\n************\nLast year I wrote extensively about our derivatives contracts, which were then the subject of both\ncontroversy and misunderstanding. For that discussion, please go to www.berkshirehathaway.com.\nWe have since changed only a few of our positions. Some credit contracts have run off. The terms of\nabout 10% of our equity put contracts have also changed: Maturities have been shortened and strike pricesmaterially reduced. In these modifications, no money changed hands.\nA few points from last year’s discussion are worth repeating:\n(1) Though it’s no sure thing, I expect our contracts in aggregate to deliver us a profit over their lifetime,\neven when investment income on the huge amount of float they provide us is excluded in thecalculation. Our derivatives float – which is not included in the $62 billion of insurance float Idescribed earlier – was about $6.3 billion at yearend.\n(2) Only a handful of our contracts require us to post collateral under any circumstances. At last year’s low\npoint in the stock and credit markets, our posting requirement was $1.7 billion, a small fraction of thederivatives-related float we held. When we do post collateral, let me add, the securities we put upcontinue to earn money for our account.\n(3) Finally, you should expect large swings in the carrying value of these contracts, items that can affect\nour reported quarterly earnings in a huge way but that do not affect our cash or investment holdings.That thought certainly fit 2009’s circumstances. Here are the pre-tax quarterly gains and losses fromderivatives valuations that were part of our reported earnings last year:\nQuarter\n$ Gain (Loss) in Billions\n1 (1.517)\n2 2.3573 1.7324 1.052\nAs we’ve explained, these wild swings neither cheer nor bother Charlie and me. When we report to\nyou, we will continue to separate out these figures (as we do realized investment gains and losses) so that you canmore clearly view the earnings of our operating businesses. We are delighted that we hold the derivativescontracts that we do. To date we have significantly profited from the float they provide. We expect also to earnfurther investment income over the life of our contracts.\n15\n\nWe have long invested in derivatives contracts that Charlie and I think are mispriced, just as we try to\ninvest in mispriced stocks and bonds. Indeed, we first reported to you that we held such contracts in early 1998.The dangers that derivatives pose for both participants and society – dangers of which we’ve long warned, andthat can be dynamite – arise when these contracts lead to leverage and/or counterparty risk that is extreme. AtBerkshire nothing like that has occurred – nor will it.\nIt’s my job to keep Berkshire far away from such problems. Charlie and I believe that a CEO must not\ndelegate risk control. It’s simply too important. At Berkshire, I both initiate and monitor every derivatives\ncontract on our books, with the exception of operations-related contracts at a few of our subsidiaries, such asMidAmerican, and the minor runoff contracts at General Re. If Berkshire ever gets in trouble, it will be myfault.\nIt will not be because of misjudgments made by a Risk Committee or Chief Risk Officer.\n************\nIn my view a board of directors of a huge financial institution is derelict if it does not insist that its\nCEO bear full responsibility for risk control. If he’s incapable of handling that job, he should look for otheremployment. And if he fails at it – with the government thereupon required to step in with funds or guarantees –the financial consequences for him and his board should be severe.\nIt has not been shareholders who have botched the operations of some of our country’s largest financial\ninstitutions. Yet they have borne the burden, with 90% or more of the value of their holdings wiped out in mostcases of failure. Collectively, they have lost more than $500 billion in just the four largest financial fiascos of thelast two years. To say these owners have been “bailed-out” is to make a mockery of the term.\nThe CEOs and directors of the failed companies, however, have largely gone unscathed. Their fortunes may\nhave been diminished by the disasters they oversaw, but they still live in grand style. It is the behavior of theseCEOs and directors that needs to be changed: If their institutions and the country are harmed by theirrecklessness, they should pay a heavy price – one not reimbursable by the companies they’ve damaged nor byinsurance. CEOs and, in many cases, directors have long benefitted from oversized financial carrots; somemeaningful sticks now need to be part of their employment picture as well.\nAn Inconvenient Truth (Boardroom Overheating)\nOur subsidiaries made a few small “bolt-on” acquisitions last year for cash, but our blockbuster deal\nwith BNSF required us to issue about 95,000 Berkshire shares that amounted to 6.1% of those previouslyoutstanding. Charlie and I enjoy issuing Berkshire stock about as much as we relish prepping for a colonoscopy.\nThe reason for our distaste is simple. If we wouldn’t dream of selling Berkshire in its entirety at the\ncurrent market price, why in the world should we “sell” a significant part of the company at that same inadequateprice by issuing our stock in a merger?\nIn evaluating a stock-for-stock offer, shareholders of the target company quite understandably focus on\nthe market price of the acquirer’s shares that are to be given them. But they also expect the transaction to deliverthem the intrinsic value of their own shares – the ones they are giving up. If shares of a prospective acquirer are\nselling below their intrinsic value, it’s impossible for that buyer to make a sensible deal in an all-stock deal. Yousimply can’t exchange an undervalued stock for a fully-valued one without hurting your shareholders.\nImagine, if you will, Company A and Company B, of equal size and both with businesses intrinsically\nworth $100 per share. Both of their stocks, however, sell for $80 per share. The CEO of A, long on confidenceand short on smarts, offers 1\n1⁄4shares of A for each share of B, correctly telling his directors that B is worth $100\nper share. He will neglect to explain, though, that what he is giving will cost his shareholders $125 in intrinsicvalue. If the directors are mathematically challenged as well, and a deal is therefore completed, the shareholdersof B will end up owning 55.6% of A & B’s combined assets and A’s shareholders will own 44.4%. Not everyoneat A, it should be noted, is a loser from this nonsensical transaction. Its CEO now runs a company twice as largeas his original domain, in a world where size tends to correlate with both prestige and compensation.\n16\n\nIf an acquirer’s stock is overvalued, it’s a different story: Using it as a currency works to the acquirer’s\nadvantage. That’s why bubbles in various areas of the stock market have invariably led to serial issuances ofstock by sly promoters. Going by the market value of their stock, they can afford to overpay because they are, ineffect, using counterfeit money. Periodically, many air-for-assets acquisitions have taken place, the late 1960shaving been a particularly obscene period for such chicanery. Indeed, certain large companies were built in thisway. (No one involved, of course, ever publicly acknowledges the reality of what is going on, though there isplenty of private snickering.)\nIn our BNSF acquisition, the selling shareholders quite properly evaluated our offer at $100 per share.\nThe cost to us, however, was somewhat higher since 40% of the $100 was delivered in our shares, which Charlieand I believed to be worth more than their market value. Fortunately, we had long owned a substantial amount ofBNSF stock that we purchased in the market for cash. All told, therefore, only about 30% of our cost overall waspaid with Berkshire shares.\nIn the end, Charlie and I decided that the disadvantage of paying 30% of the price through stock was\noffset by the opportunity the acquisition gave us to deploy $22 billion of cash in a business we understood andliked for the long term. It has the additional virtue of being run by Matt Rose, whom we trust and admire. Wealso like the prospect of investing additional billions over the years at reasonable rates of return. But the finaldecision was a close one. If we had needed to use more stock to make the acquisition, it would in fact have madeno sense. We would have then been giving up more than we were getting.\n************\nI have been in dozens of board meetings in which acquisitions have been deliberated, often with the\ndirectors being instructed by high-priced investment bankers (are there any other kind?). Invariably, the bankersgive the board a detailed assessment of the value of the company being purchased, with emphasis on why it isworth far more than its market price. In more than fifty years of board memberships, however, never have I heardthe investment bankers (or management!) discuss the true value of what is being given . When a deal involved the\nissuance of the acquirer’s stock, they simply used market value to measure the cost. They did this even though\nthey would have argued that the acquirer’s stock price was woefully inadequate – absolutely no indicator of itsreal value – had a takeover bid for the acquirer instead been the subject up for discussion .\nWhen stock is the currency being contemplated in an acquisition and when directors are hearing from\nan advisor, it appears to me that there is only one way to get a rational and balanced discussion. Directors shouldhire a second advisor to make the case against the proposed acquisition, with its fee contingent on the deal not\ngoing through. Absent this drastic remedy, our recommendation in respect to the use of advisors remains: “Don’task the barber whether you need a haircut.”\n************\nI can’t resist telling you a true story from long ago. We owned stock in a large well-run bank that for\ndecades had been statutorily prevented from acquisitions. Eventually, the law was changed and our bankimmediately began looking for possible purchases. Its managers – fine people and able bankers – notunexpectedly began to behave like teenage boys who had just discovered girls.\nThey soon focused on a much smaller bank, also well-run and having similar financial characteristics\nin such areas as return on equity, interest margin, loan quality, etc. Our bank sold at a modest price (that’s whywe had bought into it), hovering near book value and possessing a very low price/earnings ratio. Alongside,though, the small-bank owner was being wooed by other large banks in the state and was holding out for a priceclose to three times book value. Moreover, he wanted stock, not cash.\nNaturally, our fellows caved in and agreed to this value-destroying deal. “We need to show that we are\nin the hunt. Besides, it’s only a small deal,” they said, as if only major harm to shareholders would have been a\nlegitimate reason for holding back. Charlie’s reaction at the time: “Are we supposed to applaud because the dogthat fouls our lawn is a Chihuahua rather than a Saint Bernard?”\n17\n\nThe seller of the smaller bank – no fool – then delivered one final demand in his negotiations. “After\nthe merger,” he in effect said, perhaps using words that were phrased more diplomatically than these, “I’m goingto be a large shareholder of your bank, and it will represent a huge portion of my net worth. You have to promiseme, therefore, that you’ll never again do a deal this dumb.”\nYes, the merger went through. The owner of the small bank became richer, we became poorer, and the\nmanagers of the big bank – newly bigger – lived happily ever after.\nThe Annual Meeting\nOur best guess is that 35,000 people attended the annual meeting last year (up from 12 – nozeros\nomitted – in 1981). With our shareholder population much expanded, we expect even more this year. Therefore,we will have to make a few changes in the usual routine. There will be no change, however, in our enthusiasmfor having you attend. Charlie and I like to meet you, answer your questions and – best of all – have you buylots\nof goods from our businesses.\nThe meeting this year will be held on Saturday, May 1\nst. As always, the doors will open at the Qwest\nCenter at 7 a.m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at 8:30. At 9:30 we will go directly to thequestion-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest’s stands) will last until 3:30. After ashort recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decide to leave during the day’squestion periods, please do so while Charlie is talking. (Act fast; he can be terse.)\nThe best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We will help you do that by filling the 194,300-square-\nfoot hall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you didyour part, and most locations racked up record sales. But you can do better. (A friendly warning: If I find salesare lagging, I get testy and lock the exits.)\nGEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of\nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you ashareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which weoperate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that givencertain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. Forat least 50% of you, I believe we can.\nBe sure to visit the Bookworm. Among the more than 30 books and DVDs it will offer are two new\nbooks by my sons: Howard’s Fragile , a volume filled with photos and commentary about lives of struggle\naround the globe and Peter’s Life Is What You Make It . Completing the family trilogy will be the debut of my\nsister Doris’s biography, a story focusing on her remarkable philanthropic activities. Also available will be Poor\nCharlie’s Almanack , the story of my partner. This book is something of a publishing miracle – never advertised,\nyet year after year selling many thousands of copies from its Internet site. (Should you need to ship your bookpurchases, a nearby shipping service will be available.)\nIf you are a big spender – or, for that matter, merely a gawker – visit Elliott Aviation on the east side of\nthe Omaha airport between noon and 5:00 p.m. on Saturday. There we will have a fleet of NetJets aircraft thatwill get your pulse racing.\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. As for plane, hotel and car reservations,we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. Carol Pedersen, whohandles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it. Hotel rooms can be hard to find,but work with Carol and you will get one.\n18\n\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72ndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we\nwill again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. To obtain the Berkshire discount, you must makeyour purchases between Thursday, April 29\nthand Monday, May 3rdinclusive, and also present your meeting\ncredential. The period’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers thatnormally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have madean exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday throughSaturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having aBerkyville BBQ to which you are all invited.\nAt Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception\nfrom 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, April 30\nth. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 2nd, from 9\na.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m.\nWe will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 26ththrough Saturday, May 8th. During that period,\nplease identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement thatshows you are a Berkshire holder. Enter with rhinestones; leave with diamonds. My daughter tells me that themore you buy, the more you save (kids say the darnedest things).\nOn Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion,\nwill take on all comers – who will have their eyes wide open – in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, aremarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers.\nOur special treat for shareholders this year will be the return of my friend, Ariel Hsing, the country’s\ntop-ranked junior table tennis player (and a good bet to win at the Olympics some day). Now 14, Ariel came tothe annual meeting four years ago and demolished all comers, including me. (You can witness my humiliatingdefeat on YouTube; just type in Ariel Hsing Berkshire.)\nNaturally, I’ve been plotting a comeback and will take her on outside of Borsheims at 1:00 p.m. on\nSunday. It will be a three-point match, and after I soften her up, all shareholders are invited to try their luck atsimilar three-point contests. Winners will be given a box of See’s candy. We will have equipment available, butbring your own paddle if you think it will help. (It won’t.)\nGorat’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 2\nnd, and will be\nserving from 1 p.m. until 10 p.m. Last year, though, it was overwhelmed by demand. With many more dinersexpected this year, I’ve asked my friend, Donna Sheehan, at Piccolo’s – another favorite restaurant of mine – toserve shareholders on Sunday as well. (Piccolo’s giant root beer float is mandatory for any fan of fine dining.) Iplan to eat at both restaurants: All of the weekend action makes me really hungry, and I have favorite dishes at\neach spot. Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call 402-551-3733 on April 1\nst(but not before ) and at\nPiccolo’s call 402-342-9038.\nRegrettably, we will not be able to have a reception for international visitors this year. Our count grew\nto about 800 last year, and my simply signing one item per person took about 21⁄2hours. Since we expect even\nmore international visitors this year, Charlie and I decided we must drop this function. But be assured, wewelcome every international visitor who comes.\nLast year we changed our method of determining what questions would be asked at the meeting and\nreceived many dozens of letters applauding the new arrangement. We will therefore again have the same threefinancial journalists lead the question-and-answer period, asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders havesubmitted to them by e-mail.\n19\n\nThe journalists and their e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be e-mailed at\ncloomis@fortunemail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com, and Andrew RossSorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com. From the questions submitted, each journalist willchoose the dozen or so he or she decides are the most interesting and important. The journalists have told meyour question has the best chance of being selected if you keep it concise and include no more than two questionsin any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned ifyour question is selected.)\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the\njournalists will pick some tough ones and that’s the way we like it.\nWe will again have a drawing at 8:15 on Saturday at each of 13 microphones for those shareholders\nwishing to ask questions themselves. At the meeting, I will alternate the questions asked by the journalists withthose from the winning shareholders. We’ve added 30 minutes to the question time and will probably have timefor about 30 questions from each group.\n***********\nAt 86 and 79, Charlie and I remain lucky beyond our dreams. We were born in America; had terrific\nparents who saw that we got good educations; have enjoyed wonderful families and great health; and cameequipped with a “business” gene that allows us to prosper in a manner hugely disproportionate to thatexperienced by many people who contribute as much or more to our society’s well-being. Moreover, we havelong had jobs that we love, in which we are helped in countless ways by talented and cheerful associates. Indeed,over the years, our work has become ever more fascinating; no wonder we tap-dance to work. If pushed, wewould gladly pay substantial sums to have our jobs (but don’t tell the Comp Committee).\nNothing, however, is more fun for us than getting together with our shareholder-partners at Berkshire’s\nannual meeting. So join us on May 1\nstat the Qwest for our annual Woodstock for Capitalists. We’ll see you\nthere.\nFebruary 26, 2010 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board\nP.S. Come by rail.\n20",

In this table, Berkshire’s resultsthrough 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculated usingthe numbers originally reported.\nThe S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax . If a corporation such as Berkshire\nwere simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500\nin years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the indexshowed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n2\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nThe per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock increased by 13% in 2010. Over the\nlast 46 years (that is, since present management took over), book value has grown from $19 to $95,453, a rate of\n20.2% compounded annually.*\nThe highlight of 2010 was our acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, a purchase that’s working\nout even better than I expected. It now appears that owning this railroad will increase Berkshire’s “normal”earning power by nearly 40% pre-tax and by well over 30% after-tax. Making this purchase increased our sharecount by 6% and used $22 billion of cash. Since we’ve quickly replenished the cash, the economics of thistransaction have turned out very well.\nA “normal year,” of course, is not something that either Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of Berkshire\nand my partner, or I can define with anything like precision. But for the purpose of estimating our current earningpower, we are envisioning a year free of a mega-catastrophe in insurance and possessing a general businessclimate somewhat better than that of 2010 but weaker than that of 2005 or 2006. Using these assumptions, andseveral others that I will explain in the “Investment” section, I can estimate that the normal earning power of theassets we currently own is about $17 billion pre-tax and $12 billion after-tax, excluding any capital gains orlosses. Every day Charlie and I think about how we can build on this base.\nBoth of us are enthusiastic about BNSF’s future because railroads have major cost and environmental\nadvantages over trucking, their main competitor. Last year BNSF moved each ton of freight it carried a record500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. That’s three times more fuel-efficient than trucking is, which means\nour railroad owns an important advantage in operating costs. Concurrently, our country gains because of reducedgreenhouse emissions and a much smaller need for imported oil. When traffic travels by rail, society benefits.\nOver time, the movement of goods in the United States will increase, and BNSF should get its full\nshare of the gain. The railroad will need to invest massively to bring about this growth, but no one is bettersituated than Berkshire to supply the funds required. However slow the economy, or chaotic the markets, ourchecks will clear.\nLast year – in the face of widespread pessimism about our economy – we demonstrated our enthusiasm\nfor capital investment at Berkshire by spending $6 billion on property and equipment. Of this amount,$5.4 billion – or 90% of the total – was spent in the United States. Certainly our businesses will expand abroad inthe future, but an overwhelming part of their future investments will be at home. In 2011, we will set a newrecord for capital spending – $8 billion – and spend allof the $2 billion increase in the United States.\nMoney will always flow toward opportunity, and there is an abundance of that in America.\nCommentators today often talk of “great uncertainty.” But think back, for example, to December 6,1941, October 18, 1987 and September 10, 2001. No matter how serene today may be, tomorrow is always\nuncertain.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are\n1/1500thof those shown for A.\n3\n\nDon’t let that reality spook you. Throughout my lifetime, politicians and pundits have constantly\nmoaned about terrifying problems facing America. Yet our citizens now live an astonishing six times better than\nwhen I was born. The prophets of doom have overlooked the all-important factor that iscertain: Human potential\nis far from exhausted, and the American system for unleashing that potential – a system that has worked wondersfor over two centuries despite frequent interruptions for recessions and even a Civil War – remains alive andeffective.\nWe are not natively smarter than we were when our country was founded nor do we work harder. But\nlook around you and see a world beyond the dreams of any colonial citizen. Now, as in 1776, 1861, 1932 and1941, America’s best days lie ahead.\nPerformance\nCharlie and I believe that those entrusted with handling the funds of others should establish\nperformance goals at the onset of their stewardship. Lacking such standards, managements are tempted to shoot\nthe arrow of performance and then paint the bull’s-eye around wherever it lands.\nIn Berkshire’s case, we long ago told you that our job is to increase per-share intrinsic value at a rate\ngreater than the increase (including dividends) of the S&P 500. In some years we succeed; in others we fail. But,if we are unable over time to reach that goal, we have done nothing for our investors, who by themselves couldhave realized an equal or better result by owning an index fund.\nThe challenge, of course, is the calculation of intrinsic value. Present that task to Charlie and me\nseparately, and you will get two different answers. Precision just isn’t possible.\nTo eliminate subjectivity, we therefore use an understated proxy for intrinsic-value – book value –\nwhen measuring our performance. To be sure, some of our businesses are worth far more than their carryingvalue on our books. (Later in this report, we’ll present a case study.) But since that premium seldom swingswildly from year to year, book value can serve as a reasonable device for tracking how we are doing.\nThe table on page 2 shows our 46-year record against the S&P, a performance quite good in the earlier\nyears and now only satisfactory. The bountiful years, we want to emphasize, will never return. The huge sums ofcapital we currently manage eliminate anychance of exceptional performance. We will strive, however, for\nbetter-than-average results and feel it fair for you to hold us to that standard.\nYearly figures, it should be noted, are neither to be ignored nor viewed as all-important. The pace of\nthe earth’s movement around the sun is not synchronized with the time required for either investment ideas oroperating decisions to bear fruit. At GEICO, for example, we enthusiastically spent $900 million last year onadvertising to obtain policyholders who deliver us no immediate profits. If we could spend twice that amountproductively, we would happily do so though short-term results would be further penalized. Many largeinvestments at our railroad and utility operations are also made with an eye to payoffs well down the road.\nTo provide you a longer-term perspective on performance, we present on the facing page the yearly\nfigures from page 2 recast into a series of five-year periods. Overall, there are 42 of these periods, and they tellan interesting story. On a comparative basis, our best years ended in the early 1980s. The market’s golden period,\nhowever, came in the 17 following years, with Berkshire achieving stellar absolute returns even as our relativeadvantage narrowed.\nAfter 1999, the market stalled (or have you already noticed that?). Consequently, the satisfactory\nperformance relative to the S&P that Berkshire has achieved since then has delivered only moderate absoluteresults.\nLooking forward, we hope to average several points better than the S&P – though that result is, of\ncourse, far from a sure thing. If we succeed in that aim, we will almost certainly produce better relative results inbad years for the stock market and suffer poorer results in strong markets.\n4\n\nBerkshire’s Corporate Performance vs. the S&P 500 by Five-Year Periods\nAnnual Percentage Change\nFive-Year Periodin Per-Share\nBook Value of\nBerkshire\n(1)in S&P 500\nwith Dividends\nIncluded\n(2)Relative\nResults\n(1)-(2)\n1965-1969 ............................................... 17.2 5.0 12.2\n1966-1970 ............................................... 14.7 3.9 10.8\n1967-1971 ............................................... 13.9 9.2 4.7\n1968-1972 ............................................... 16.8 7.5 9.3\n1969-1973 ............................................... 17.7 2.0 15.7\n1970-1974 ............................................... 15.0 (2.4) 17.4\n1971-1975 ............................................... 13.9 3.2 10.7\n1972-1976 ............................................... 20.8 4.9 15.9\n1973-1977 ............................................... 23.4 (0.2) 23.6\n1974-1978 ............................................... 24.4 4.3 20.1\n1975-1979 ............................................... 30.1 14.7 15.4\n1976-1980 ............................................... 33.4 13.9 19.5\n1977-1981 ............................................... 29.0 8.1 20.9\n1978-1982 ............................................... 29.9 14.1 15.8\n1979-1983 ............................................... 31.6 17.3 14.3\n1980-1984 ............................................... 27.0 14.8 12.2\n1981-1985 ............................................... 32.6 14.6 18.0\n1982-1986 ............................................... 31.5 19.8 11.7\n1983-1987 ............................................... 27.4 16.4 11.0\n1984-1988 ............................................... 25.0 15.2 9.8\n1985-1989 ............................................... 31.1 20.3 10.8\n1986-1990 ............................................... 22.9 13.1 9.8\n1987-1991 ............................................... 25.4 15.3 10.1\n1988-1992 ............................................... 25.6 15.8 9.8\n1989-1993 ............................................... 24.4 14.5 9.9\n1990-1994 ............................................... 18.6 8.7 9.9\n1991-1995 ............................................... 25.6 16.5 9.1\n1992-1996 ............................................... 24.2 15.2 9.0\n1993-1997 ............................................... 26.9 20.2 6.7\n1994-1998 ............................................... 33.7 24.0 9.7\n1995-1999 ............................................... 30.4 28.5 1.9\n1996-2000 ............................................... 22.9 18.3 4.6\n1997-2001 ............................................... 14.8 10.7 4.1\n1998-2002 ............................................... 10.4 (0.6) 11.0\n1999-2003 ............................................... 6\n. 0 (0.6) 6.6\n2000-2004 ............................................... 8 . 0 (2.3) 10.3\n2001-2005 ............................................... 8 . 0 0 . 6 7 . 4\n2002-2006 ............................................... 13.1 6.2 6.9\n2003-2007 ............................................... 13.3 12.8 0.5\n2004-2008 ............................................... 6 . 9 (2.2) 9.1\n2005-2009 ............................................... 8 . 6 0 . 4 8 . 2\n2006-2010 ............................................... 10.0 2.3 7.7\nNotes: The first two periods cover the five years beginning September 30 of the previous year.

All other periods involve calendar years.\nThe other notes on page 2 also apply to this table.\n5\n\nIntrinsic Value – Today and Tomorrow\nThough Berkshire’s intrinsic value cannot be precisely calculated, two of its three key pillars can be\nmeasured. Charlie and I rely heavily on these measurements when we make our own estimates of Berkshire’s\nvalue.\nThe first component of value is our investments: stocks, bonds and cash equivalents. At yearend these\ntotaled $158 billion at market value.\nInsurance float – money we temporarily hold in our insurance operations that does not belong to us –\nfunds $66 billion of our investments. This float is “free” as long as insurance underwriting breaks even, meaningthat the premiums we receive equal the losses and expenses we incur. Of course, underwriting results are volatile,swinging erratically between profits and losses. Over our entire history, though, we’ve been significantlyprofitable, and I also expect us to average breakeven results or better in the future. If we do that, all of ourinvestments – those funded both by float and by retained earnings – can be viewed as an element of value forBerkshire shareholders.\nBerkshire’s second component of value is earnings that come from sources other than investments and\ninsurance underwriting. These earnings are delivered by our 68 non-insurance companies, itemized on page 106.In Berkshire’s early years, we focused on the investment side. During the past two decades, however, we’veincreasingly emphasized the development of earnings from non-insurance businesses, a practice that willcontinue.\nThe following tables illustrate this shift. In the first table, we present per-share investments at decade\nintervals beginning in 1970, three years after we entered the insurance business. We exclude those investmentsapplicable to minority interests.\nYearend\nPer-Share\nInvestments PeriodCompounded Annual Increase\nin Per-Share Investments\n1970 ................... $ 6 6\n1980 ................... 7 5 4 1970-1980 27.5%\n1990 ................... 7,798 1980-1990 26.3%\n2000 ................... 50,229 1990-2000 20.5%\n2010 ................... 94,730 2000-2010 6.6%\nThough our compounded annual increase in per-share investments was a healthy 19.9% over the\n40-year period, our rate of increase has slowed sharply as we have focused on using funds to buy operatingbusinesses.\nThe payoff from this shift is shown in the following table, which illustrates how earnings of our\nnon-insurance businesses have increased, again on a per-share basis and after applicable minority interests.\nYear Per-Share\nPre-Tax Earnings PeriodCompounded Annual Increase in\nPer-Share Pre-Tax Earnings\n1970 ............ $ 2.87\n1980 ............ 19.01 1970-1980 20.8%\n1990 ............ 102.58 1980-1990 18.4%\n2000 ............ 918.66 1990-2000 24.5%\n2010 ............ 5,926.04 2000-2010 20.5%\n6\n\nFor the forty years, our compounded annual gain in pre-tax, non-insurance earnings per share is 21.0%.\nDuring the same period, Berkshire’s stock price increased at a rate of 22.1% annually. Over time, you can expect\nour stock price to move in rough tandem with Berkshire’s investments and earnings. Market price and intrinsicvalue often follow very different paths – sometimes for extended periods – but eventually they meet.\nThere is a third, more subjective, element to an intrinsic value calculation that can be either positive or\nnegative: the efficacy with which retained earnings will be deployed in the future. We, as well as many otherbusinesses, are likely to retain earnings over the next decade that will equal, or even exceed, the capital we presentlyemploy. Some companies will turn these retained dolla rs into fifty-cent pieces, others into two-dollar bills.\nThis “what-will-they-do-with-the-money” factor must always be evaluated along with the\n“what-do-we-have-now” calculation in order for us, or anybody, to arrive at a sensible estimate of a company’sintrinsic value. That’s because an outside investor stands by helplessly as management reinvests his share of thecompany’s earnings. If a CEO can be expected to do this job well, the reinvestment prospects add to thecompany’s current value; if the CEO’s talents or motives are suspect, today’s value must be discounted. Thedifference in outcome can be huge. A dollar of then-value in the hands of Sears Roebuck’s or MontgomeryWard’s CEOs in the late 1960s had a far different destiny than did a dollar entrusted to Sam Walton.\n************\nCharlie and I hope that the per-share earnings of our non-insurance businesses continue to increase at a\ndecent rate. But the job gets tougher as the numbers get larger. We will need both good performance from ourcurrent businesses and more major acquisitions. We’re prepared. Our elephant gun has been reloaded, and my\ntrigger finger is itchy.\nPartially offsetting our anchor of size are several important advantages we have. First, we possess a\ncadre of truly skilled managers who have an unusual commitment to their own operations and to Berkshire.Many of our CEOs are independently wealthy and work only because they love what they do. They arevolunteers, not mercenaries. Because no one can offer them a job they would enjoy more, they can’t be luredaway.\nAt Berkshire, managers can focus on running their businesses: They are not subjected to meetings at\nheadquarters nor financing worries nor Wall Street harassment. They simply get a letter from me every two years(it’s reproduced on pages 104-105) and call me when they wish. And their wishes do differ: There are managersto whom I have not talked in the last year, while there is one with whom I talk almost daily. Our trust is in peoplerather than process. A “hire well, manage little” code suits both them and me.\nBerkshire’s CEOs come in many forms. Some have MBAs; others never finished college. Some use\nbudgets and are by-the-book types; others operate by the seat of their pants. Our team resembles a baseball squadcomposed of all-stars having vastly different batting styles. Changes in our line-up are seldom required.\nOur second advantage relates to the allocation of the money our businesses earn. After meeting the\nneeds of those businesses, we have very substantial sums left over. Most companies limit themselves toreinvesting funds within the industry in which they have been operating. That often restricts them, however, to a“universe” for capital allocation that is both tiny and quite inferior to what is available in the wider world.Competition for the few opportunities that areavailable tends to become fierce. The seller has the upper hand, as\na girl might if she were the only female at a party attended by many boys. That lopsided situation would be greatfor the girl, but terrible for the boys.\nAt Berkshire we face no institutional restraints when we deploy capital. Charlie and I are limited only\nby our ability to understand the likely future of a possible acquisition. If we clear that hurdle – and frequently wecan’t – we are then able to compare any one opportunity against a host of others.\n7\n\nWhen I took control of Berkshire in 1965, I didn’t exploit this advantage. Berkshire was then only in\ntextiles, where it had in the previous decade lost significant money. The dumbest thing I could have done was to\npursue “opportunities” to improve and expand the existing textile operation – so for years that’s exactly what Idid. And then, in a final burst of brilliance, I went out and bought another textile company. Aaaaaaargh!\nEventually I came to my senses, heading first into insurance and then into other industries.\nThere is even a supplement to this world-is-our-oyster advantage: In addition to evaluating the\nattractions of one business against a host of others, we also measure businesses against opportunities available inmarketable securities, a comparison most managements don’t make. Often, businesses are priced ridiculouslyhigh against what can likely be earned from investments in stocks or bonds. At such moments, we buy securitiesand bide our time.\nOur flexibility in respect to capital allocation has accounted for much of our progress to date. We have\nbeen able to take money we earn from, say, See’s Candies or Business Wire (two of our best-run businesses, butalso two offering limited reinvestment opportunities) and use it as part of the stake we needed to buy BNSF.\nOur final advantage is the hard-to-duplicate culture that permeates Berkshire. And in businesses,\nculture counts.\nTo start with, the directors who represent you think and act like owners. They receive token\ncompensation: no options, no restricted stock and, for that matter, virtually no cash. We do not provide themdirectors and officers liability insurance, a given at almost every other large public company. If they mess upwith your money, they will lose their money as well. Leaving my holdings aside, directors and their families ownBerkshire shares worth more than $3 billion. Our directors, therefore, monitor Berkshire’s actions and resultswith keen interest and an owner’s eye. You and I are lucky to have them as stewards.\nThis same owner-orientation prevails among our managers. In many cases, these are people who have\nsought out Berkshire as an acquirer for a business that they and their families have long owned. They came to uswith an owner’s mindset, and we provide an environment that encourages them to retain it. Having managerswho love their businesses is no small advantage.\nCultures self-propagate. Winston Churchill once said, “You shape your houses and then they shape\nyou.” That wisdom applies to businesses as well. Bureaucratic procedures beget more bureaucracy, and imperialcorporate palaces induce imperious behavior. (As one wag put it, “You know you’re no longer CEO when youget in the back seat of your car and it doesn’t move.”) At Berkshire’s “World Headquarters” our annual rent is$270,212. Moreover, the home-office investment in furniture, art, Coke dispenser, lunch room, high-techequipment – you name it – totals $301,363. As long as Charlie and I treat your money as if it were our own,Berkshire’s managers are likely to be careful with it as well.\nOur compensation programs, our annual meeting and even our annual reports are all designed with an\neye to reinforcing the Berkshire culture, and making it one that will repel and expel managers of a different bent.This culture grows stronger every year, and it will remain intact long after Charlie and I have left the scene.\nWe will need all of the strengths I’ve just described to do reasonably well. Our managers will deliver;\nyou can count on that. But whether Charlie and I can hold up our end in capital allocation depends in part on thecompetitive environment for acquisitions. You will get our best efforts.\nGEICO\nNow let me tell you a story that will help you understand how the intrinsic value of a business can far\nexceed its book value. Relating this tale also gives me a chance to relive some great memories.\nSixty years ago last month, GEICO entered my life, destined to shape it in a huge way. I was then a\n20-year-old graduate student at Columbia, having elected to go there because my hero, Ben Graham, taught a\nonce-a-week class at the school.\n8\n\nOne day at the library, I checked out Ben’s entry in Who’s Who in America and found he was\nchairman of Government Employees Insurance Co. (now called GEICO). I knew nothing of insurance and had\nnever heard of the company. The librarian, however, steered me to a large compendium of insurers and, afterreading the page on GEICO, I decided to visit the company. The following Saturday, I boarded an early train forWashington.\nAlas, when I arrived at the company’s headquarters, the building was closed. I then rather frantically\nstarted pounding on a door, until finally a janitor appeared. I asked him if there was anyone in the office I couldtalk to, and he steered me to the only person around, Lorimer Davidson.\nThat was my lucky moment. During the next four hours, “Davy” gave me an education about both\ninsurance and GEICO. It was the beginning of a wonderful friendship. Soon thereafter, I graduated fromColumbia and became a stock salesman in Omaha. GEICO, of course, was my prime recommendation, which gotme off to a great start with dozens of customers. GEICO also jump-started my net worth because, soon aftermeeting Davy, I made the stock 75% of my $9,800 investment portfolio. (Even so, I felt over-diversified.)\nSubsequently, Davy became CEO of GEICO, taking the company to undreamed-of heights before it got\ninto trouble in the mid-1970s, a few years after his retirement. When that happened – with the stock falling bymore than 95% – Berkshire bought about one-third of the company in the market, a position that over the yearsincreased to 50% because of GEICO’s repurchases of its own shares. Berkshire’s cost for this half of the businesswas $46 million. (Despite the size of our position, we exercised no control over operations.)\nWe then purchased the remaining 50% of GEICO at the beginning of 1996, which spurred Davy, at 95,\nto make a video tape saying how happy he was that his beloved GEICO would permanently reside withBerkshire. (He also playfully concluded with, “Next time, Warren, please make an appointment.”)\nA lot has happened at GEICO during the last 60 years, but its core goal – saving Americans substantial\nmoney on their purchase of auto insurance – remains unchanged. (Try us at 1-800-847-7536 orwww.GEICO.com.) In other words, get the policyholder’s business by deserving his business. Focusing on this\nobjective, the company has grown to be America’s third-largest auto insurer, with a market share of 8.8%.\nWhen Tony Nicely, GEICO’s CEO, took over in 1993, that share was 2.0%, a level at which it had\nbeen stuck for more than a decade. GEICO became a different company under Tony, finding a path to consistentgrowth while simultaneously maintaining underwriting discipline and keeping its costs low.\nLet me quantify Tony’s achievement. When, in 1996, we bought the 50% of GEICO we didn’t already\nown, it cost us about $2.3 billion. That price implied a value of $4.6 billion for 100%. GEICO then had tangiblenet worth of $1.9 billion.\nThe excess over tangible net worth of the implied value – $2.7 billion – was what we estimated\nGEICO’s “goodwill” to be worth at that time. That goodwill represented the economic value of the policyholderswho were then doing business with GEICO. In 1995, those customers had paid the company $2.8 billion inpremiums. Consequently, we were valuing GEICO’s customers at about 97% (2.7/2.8) of what they wereannually paying the company. By industry standards, that was a very high price. But GEICO was no ordinaryinsurer: Because of the company’s low costs, its policyholders were consistently profitable and unusually loyal.\nToday, premium volume is $14.3 billion and growing. Yet we carry the goodwill of GEICO on our\nbooks at only $1.4 billion, an amount that will remain unchanged no matter how much the value of GEICOincreases. (Under accounting rules, you write down the carrying value of goodwill if its economic valuedecreases, but leave it unchanged if economic value increases.) Using the 97%-of-premium-volume yardstick weapplied to our 1996 purchase, the real value today of GEICO’s economic goodwill is about $14 billion. And thisvalue is likely to be much higher ten and twenty years from now. GEICO – off to a strong start in 2011 – is thegift that keeps giving.\n9\n\nOne not-so-small footnote: Under Tony, GEICO has developed one of the country’s largest personal-\nlines insurance agencies , which primarily sells homeowners policies to our GEICO auto insurance customers. In\nthis business, we represent a number of insurers that are not affiliated with us. They take the risk; we simply sign\nup the customers. Last year we sold 769,898 new policies at this agency operation, up 34% from the year before.The obvious way this activity aids us is that it produces commission revenue; equally important is the fact that itfurther strengthens our relationship with our policyholders, helping us retain them.\nI owe an enormous debt to Tony and Davy (and, come to think of it, to that janitor as well).\n************\nNow, let’s examine the four major sectors of Berkshire. Each has vastly different balance sheet and\nincome characteristics from the others. Lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. So we’ll present themas four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them.\nWe will look first at insurance, Berkshire’s core operation and the engine that has propelled our\nexpansion over the years.\nInsurance\nProperty-casualty (“P/C”) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases,\nsuch as those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This\ncollect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go toothers. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire’s benefit. Though individual policies and claimscome and go, the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume.Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown: Just take a look at thefollowing table:\nYearend\nFloat\n(in $ millions)\n1970 ........................................ $ 3 9\n1980 ........................................ 2 3 7\n1990 ........................................ 1,632\n2000 ........................................ 27,871\n2010 ........................................ 65,832\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income that our float produces. When such a profit occurs, we enjoy the use of freemoney – and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Alas, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates\nintense competition, so vigorous in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at asignificant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State\nFarm, by far the country’s largest insurer and a well-managed company, has incurred an underwriting loss inseven of the last ten years. During that period, its aggregate underwriting loss was more than $20 billion.\nAt Berkshire, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for eight consecutive years, our total\nunderwriting gain for the period having been $17 billion. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwriteprofitably in most – though certainly not all – future years. If we accomplish that, our float will be better thancost-free. We will benefit just as we would if some party deposited $66 billion with us, paid us a fee for holdingits money and then let us invest its funds for our own benefit.\n10\n\nLet me emphasize again that cost-free float is notan outcome to be expected for the P/C industry as a\nwhole: In most years, industry premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the\nindustry’s overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized byAmerican industry, a sorry performance almost certain to continue. Berkshire’s outstanding economics exist onlybecause we have some terrific managers running some unusual businesses. We’ve already told you about GEICO,but we have two other very large operations, and a bevy of smaller ones as well, each a star in its own way.\n************\nFirst off is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, run by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks that no one\nelse has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, mostimportantly, brains in a manner that is unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risksthat are inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are farmore conservative than most large insurers\nin that respect. In the past year, Ajit has significantly increased his life reinsurance operation, developing annualpremium volume of about $2 billion that will repeat for decades.\nFrom a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $30 billion and\nsignificant underwriting profits, a feat that no CEO of any other insurer has come close to matching. By hisaccomplishments, he has added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire. Even kryptonitebounces off Ajit.\n************\nWe have another insurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.\nAt bottom, a sound insurance operation requires four disciplines: (1) An understanding of allexposures\nthat might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) A conservative evaluation of the likelihood of any exposure actually\ncausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) The setting of a premium that will deliver a profit, on average,after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) The willingness to walk away if theappropriate premium can’t be obtained.\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. The urgings of Wall Street, pressures from\nthe agency force and brokers, or simply a refusal by a testosterone-driven CEO to accept shrinking volumes hasled too many insurers to write business at inadequate prices. “The other guy is doing it so we must as well” spellstrouble in any business, but none more so than insurance.\nTad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re’s huge\nfloat has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, it will continue to be.\n************\nFinally, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them specializing in odd corners of the\ninsurance world. In aggregate, their results have consistently been profitable and, as the table below shows, thefloat they provide us is substantial. Charlie and I treasure these companies and their managers.\nHere is the record of all four segments of our property-casualty and life insurance businesses:\nUnderwriting Profit\nYearend Float\n(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2010 2009 2010 2009\nGeneral Re ...................... $ 4 5 2 $ 4 7 7 $20,049 $21,014\nBH Reinsurance .................. 1 7 6 2 5 0 30,370 27,753\nGEICO ......................... 1,117 649 10,272 9,613\nOther Primary ................... 2 6 8 8 4 5,141 5,061\n$2,013 $1,460 $65,832 $63,441\nAmong large insurance operations, Berkshire’s impresses me as the best in the world.\n11\n\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations\nOur activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront. Let’s look, though, at a summary balance\nsheet and earnings statement for the entire group.\nBalance Sheet 12/31/10 (in millions)\nAssets\nCash and equivalents ................. $ 2,673\nAccounts and notes receivable .......... 5,396\nInventory .......................... 7,101\nOther current assets .................. 5 5 0\nTotal current assets ................... 15,720\nGoodwill and other intangibles ......... 16,976\nFixed assets ........................ 15,421\nOther assets ........................ 3,029\n$51,146Liabilities and EquityNotes payable ....................... $ 1,805\nOther current liabilities ............... 8,169\nTotal current liabilities ................ 9,974\nDeferred taxes ...................... 3,001\nTerm debt and other liabilities .......... 6,621\nEquity ............................. 31,550\n$51,146\nEarnings Statement (in millions)\n2010 2009 2008\nRevenues ......................................................... $66,610 $61,665 $66,099\nOperating expenses (including depreciation of $1,362 in 2010, $1,422 in 2009\nand $1,280 in 2008) ............................................... 62,225 59,509 61,937\nInterest expense .................................................... 1 1 1 9 8 1 3 9\nPre-tax earnings .................................................... 4,274* 2,058* 4,023*\nIncome taxes and non-controlling interests ............................... 1,812 945 1,740\nNet earnings ....................................................... $ 2,462 $ 1,113 $ 2,283\n*Does not include purchase-accounting adjustments.\nThis group of companies sells products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of the businesses\nenjoy terrific economics, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets that run from 25% after-tax to\nmore than 100%. Others produce good returns in the area of 12-20%. Unfortunately, a few have very poor\nreturns, a result of some serious mistakes I have made in my job of capital allocation. These errors came aboutbecause I misjudged either the competitive strength of the business I was purchasing or the future economics ofthe industry in which it operated. I try to look out ten or twenty years when making an acquisition, but sometimesmy eyesight has been poor.\nMost of the companies in this section improved their earnings last year and four set records. Let’s look\nfirst at the record-breakers.\n• TTI, our electronic components distributor, had sales 21% above its previous high (recorded in 2008)\nand pre-tax earnings that topped its earlier record by 58%. Its sales gains spanned three continents, withNorth America at 16%, Europe at 26%, and Asia at 50%. The thousands of items TTI distributes arepedestrian, many selling for less than a dollar. The magic of TTI’s exceptional performance is createdby Paul Andrews, its CEO, and his associates.\n12\n\n• Forest River, our RV and boat manufacturer, had record sales of nearly $2 billion and record earnings\nas well. Forest River has 82 plants, and I have yet to visit one (or the home office, for that matter).\nThere’s no need; Pete Liegl, the company’s CEO, runs a terrific operation. Come view his products atthe annual meeting. Better yet, buy one.\n• CTB, our farm-equipment company, again set an earnings record. I told you in the 2008 Annual Report\nabout Vic Mancinelli, the company’s CEO. He just keeps getting better. Berkshire paid $140 millionfor CTB in 2002. It has since paid us dividends of $160 million and eliminated $40 million of debt.Last year it earned $106 million pre-tax. Productivity gains have produced much of this increase. Whenwe bought CTB, sales per employee were $189,365; now they are $405,878.\n• Would you believe shoes? H. H. Brown, run by Jim Issler and best known for its Born brand, set a new\nrecord for sales and earnings (helped by its selling 1,110 pairs of shoes at our annual meeting). Jim hasbrilliantly adapted to major industry changes. His work, I should mention, is overseen by FrankRooney, 89, a superb businessman and still a dangerous fellow with whom to have a bet on the golfcourse.\nA huge story in this sector’s year-to-year improvement occurred at NetJets. I can’t overstate the\nbreadth and importance of Dave Sokol’s achievements at this company, the leading provider of fractional\nownership of jet airplanes. NetJets has long been an operational success, owning a 2010 market share five timesthat of its nearest competitor. Our overwhelming leadership stems from a wonderful team of pilots, mechanicsand service personnel. This crew again did its job in 2010, with customer satisfaction, as delineated in our regularsurveys, hitting new highs.\nEven though NetJets was consistently a runaway winner with customers, our financial results, since its\nacquisition in 1998, were a failure. In the 11 years through 2009, the company reported an aggregate pre-tax lossof $157 million, a figure that was far understated since borrowing costs at NetJets were heavily subsidized by itsfree use of Berkshire’s credit. Had NetJets been operating on a stand-alone basis, its loss over the years wouldhave been several hundreds of millions greater.\nWe are now charging NetJets an appropriate fee for Berkshire’s guarantee. Despite this fee (which\ncame to $38 million in 2010), NetJets earned $207 million pre-tax in 2010, a swing of $918 million from 2009.Dave’s quick restructuring of management and the company’s rationalization of its purchasing and spendingpolicies has ended the hemorrhaging of cash and turned what was Berkshire’s only major business problem into asolidly profitable operation.\nDave has meanwhile maintained NetJets’ industry-leading reputation for safety and service. In many\nimportant ways, our training and operational standards are considerably stronger than those required by the FAA.Maintaining top-of-the-line standards is the right thing to do, but I also have a selfish reason for championing thispolicy. My family and I have flown more than 5,000 hours on NetJets (that’s equal to being airborne 24 hours aday for seven months) and will fly thousands of hours more in the future. We receive no special treatment andhave used a random mix of at least 100 planes and 300 crews. Whichever the plane or crew, we always know weare flying with the best-trained pilots in private aviation.\nThe largest earner in our manufacturing, service and retailing sector is Marmon, a collection of 130\nbusinesses. We will soon increase our ownership in this company to 80% by carrying out our scheduled purchaseof 17% of its stock from the Pritzker family. The cost will be about $1.5 billion. We will then purchase theremaining Pritzker holdings in 2013 or 2014, whichever date is selected by the family. Frank Ptak runs Marmonwonderfully, and we look forward to 100% ownership.\n13\n\nNext to Marmon, the two largest earners in this sector are Iscar and McLane. Both had excellent years.\nIn 2010, Grady Rosier’s McLane entered the wine and spirits distribution business to supplement its $32 billion\noperation as a distributor of food products, cigarettes, candy and sundries. In purchasing Empire Distributors, anoperator in Georgia and North Carolina, we teamed up with David Kahn, the company’s dynamic CEO. David isleading our efforts to expand geographically. By yearend he had already made his first acquisition, Horizon Wineand Spirits in Tennessee.\nAt Iscar, profits were up 159% in 2010, and we may well surpass pre-recession levels in 2011. Sales\nare improving throughout the world, particularly in Asia. Credit Eitan Wertheimer, Jacob Harpaz and DannyGoldman for an exceptional performance, one far superior to that of Iscar’s main competitors.\nAll that is good news. Our businesses related to home construction, however, continue to struggle.\nJohns Manville, MiTek, Shaw and Acme Brick have maintained their competitive positions, but their profits arefar below the levels of a few years ago. Combined, these operations earned $362 million pre-tax in 2010compared to $1.3 billion in 2006, and their employment has fallen by about 9,400.\nA housing recovery will probably begin within a year or so. In any event, it is certain to occur at some\npoint. Consequently: (1) At MiTek, we have made, or committed to, five bolt-on acquisitions during the pasteleven months; (2) At Acme, we just recently acquired the leading manufacturer of brick in Alabama for$50 million; (3) Johns Manville is building a $55 million roofing membrane plant in Ohio, to be completed nextyear; and (4) Shaw will spend $200 million in 2011 on plant and equipment, all of it situated in America. Thesebusinesses entered the recession strong and will exit it stronger. At Berkshire, our time horizon is forever.\nRegulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\nWe have two very large businesses, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, with important common\ncharacteristics that distinguish them from our many others. Consequently, we give them their own sector in this\nletter and split out their financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.\nA key characteristic of both companies is the huge investment they have in very long-lived, regulated\nassets, with these funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is\nnot needed: Both businesses have earning power that, even under very adverse business conditions, amply coverstheir interest requirements. For example, in recessionary 2010 with BNSF’s car loadings far off peak levels, thecompany’s interest coverage was 6:1.\nBoth companies are heavily regulated, and both will have a never-ending need to make major\ninvestments in plant and equipment. Both also need to provide efficient, customer-satisfying service to earn therespect of their communities and regulators. In return, both need to be assured that they will be allowed to earnreasonable earnings on future capital investments.\nEarlier I explained just how important railroads are to our country’s future. Rail moves 42% of\nAmerica’s inter-city freight, measured by ton-miles, and BNSF moves more than any other railroad – about 28%of the industry total. A little math will tell you that more than 11% of allinter-city ton-miles of freight in the U.S.\nis transported by BNSF. Given the shift of population to the West, our share may well inch higher.\nAll of this adds up to a huge responsibility. We are a major and essential part of the American\neconomy’s circulatory system, obliged to constantly maintain and improve our 23,000 miles of track along withits ancillary bridges, tunnels, engines and cars. In carrying out this job, we must anticipate society’s needs, notmerely react to them. Fulfilling our societal obligation, we will regularly spend far more than our depreciation,with this excess amounting to $2 billion in 2011. I’m confident we will earn appropriate returns on our hugeincremental investments. Wise regulation and wise investment are two sides of the same coin.\nAt MidAmerican, we participate in a similar “social compact.” We are expected to put up ever-\nincreasing sums to satisfy the future needs of our customers. If we meanwhile operate reliably and efficiently, weknow that we will obtain a fair return on these investments.\n14\n\nMidAmerican supplies 2.4 million customers in the U.S. with electricity, operating as the largest\nsupplier in Iowa, Wyoming and Utah and as an important provider in other states as well. Our pipelines transport\n8% of the country’s natural gas. Obviously, many millions of Americans depend on us every day.\nMidAmerican has delivered outstanding results for both its owners (Berkshire’s interest is 89.8%) and its\ncustomers. Shortly after MidAmerican purchased Northern Natural Gas pipeline in 2002, that company’sperformance as a pipeline was rated dead last, 43 out of 43, by the leading authority in the field. In the most recentreport published, Northern Natural was ranked second. The top spot was held by our other pipeline, Kern River.\nIn its electric business, MidAmerican has a comparable record. Iowa rates have not increased since we\npurchased our operation there in 1999. During the same period, the other major electric utility in the state hasraised prices more than 70% and now has rates far above ours. In certain metropolitan areas in which the twoutilities operate side by side, electric bills of our customers run far below those of their neighbors. I am told thatcomparable houses sell at higher prices in these cities if they are located in our service area.\nMidAmerican will have 2,909 megawatts of wind generation in operation by the end of 2011, more\nthan any other regulated electric utility in the country. The total amount that MidAmerican has invested orcommitted to wind is a staggering $5.4 billion. We can make this sort of investment because MidAmericanretains allof its earnings, unlike other utilities that generally pay out most of what they earn.\nAs you can tell by now, I am proud of what has been accomplished for our society by Matt Rose at\nBNSF and by David Sokol and Greg Abel at MidAmerican. I am also both proud and grateful for what they haveaccomplished for Berkshire shareholders.

CORT experienced a pickup in business as the year progressedand also significantly tightened its operations. The combination increased its pre-tax results from a loss of$3 million in 2009 to $18 million of profit in 2010.\nAt Clayton, we produced 23,343 homes, 47% of the industry’s total of 50,046. Contrast this to the peak\nyear of 1998, when 372,843 homes were manufactured. (We then had an industry share of 8%.) Sales would havebeen terrible last year under any circumstances, but the financing problems I commented upon in the 2009 reportcontinue to exacerbate the distress. To explain: Home-financing policies of our government, expressed throughthe loans found acceptable by FHA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, favor site-built homes and work to negate theprice advantage that manufactured homes offer.\nWe finance more manufactured-home buyers than any other company. Our experience, therefore,\nshould be instructive to those parties preparing to overhaul our country’s home-loan practices. Let’s take a look.\nClayton owns 200,804 mortgages that it originated. (It also has some mortgage portfolios that it\npurchased.) At the origination of these contracts, the average FICO score of our borrowers was 648, and 47%were 640 or below. Your banker will tell you that people with such scores are generally regarded as questionablecredits.\nNevertheless, our portfolio has performed well during conditions of stress. Here’s our loss experience\nduring the last five years for originated loans:\nYear\nNet Losses as a Percentage\nof Average Loans\n2006 .............................. 1.53%\n2007 .............................. 1.27%\n2008 .............................. 1.17%\n2009 .............................. 1.86%\n2010 .............................. 1.72%\nOur borrowers get in trouble when they lose their jobs, have health problems, get divorced, etc. The\nrecession has hit them hard. But they want to stay in their homes, and generally they borrowed sensible amountsin relation to their income. In addition, we were keeping the originated mortgages for our own account, whichmeans we were not securitizing or otherwise reselling them. If we were stupid in our lending, wewere going to\npay the price. That concentrates the mind.\nIf home buyers throughout the country had behaved like our buyers, America would not have had the\ncrisis that it did. Our approach was simply to get a meaningful down-payment and gear fixed monthly payments\nto a sensible percentage of income. This policy kept Clayton solvent and also kept buyers in their homes.\nHome ownership makes sense for most Americans, particularly at today’s lower prices and bargain\ninterest rates. All things considered, the third best investment I ever made was the purchase of my home, though Iwould have made far more money had I instead rented and used the purchase money to buy stocks. (The two bestinvestments were wedding rings.) For the $31,500 I paid for our house, my family and I gained 52 years ofterrific memories with more to come.\n16\n\nBut a house can be a nightmare if the buyer’s eyes are bigger than his wallet and if a lender – often\nprotected by a government guarantee – facilitates his fantasy. Our country’s social goal should not be to put\nfamilies into the house of their dreams, but rather to put them into a house they can afford.\nInvestments\nBelow we show our common stock investments that at yearend had a market value of more than\n$1 billion.\n12/31/10\nShares CompanyPercentage of\nCompany\nOwned Cost * Market\n(in millions)\n151,610,700 American Express Company ........................ 12.6 $ 1,287 $ 6,507\n225,000,000 BYD Company, Ltd. .............................. 9 . 9 2 3 2 1,182\n200,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company .......................... 8 . 6 1,299 13,154\n29,109,637 ConocoPhillips .................................. 2 . 0 2,028 1,982\n45,022,563 Johnson & Johnson ............................... 1 . 6 2,749 2,785\n97,214,584 Kraft Foods Inc. ................................. 5 . 6 3,207 3,063\n19,259,600 Munich Re ...................................... 10.5 2,896 2,924\n3,947,555 POSCO ........................................ 4 . 6 7 6 8 1,706\n72,391,036 The Procter & Gamble Company .................... 2 . 6 4 6 4 4,657\n25,848,838 Sanofi-Aventis .................................. 2 . 0 2,060 1,656\n242,163,773 Tesco plc ....................................... 3 . 0 1,414 1,608\n78,060,769 U.S. Bancorp .................................... 4 . 1 2,401 2,105\n39,037,142 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ............................. 1 . 1 1,893 2,105\n358,936,125 Wells Fargo & Company .......................... 6 . 8 8,015 11,123\nOthers ......................................... 3,020 4,956\nTotal Common Stocks Carried at Market .............. $33,733 $61,513\n*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP “cost” differs in a few cases because of\nwrite-ups or write-downs that have been required.\nIn our reported earnings we reflect only the dividends our portfolio companies pay us. Our share of the\nundistributed earnings of these investees, however, was more than $2 billion last year. These retained earnings\nare important. In our experience – and, for that matter, in the experience of investors over the past century –undistributed earnings have been either matched or exceeded by market gains, albeit in a highly irregular manner.(Indeed, sometimes the correlation goes in reverse. As one investor said in 2009: “This is worse than divorce.I’ve lost half my net worth – and I still have my wife.”) In the future, we expect our market gains to eventually atleast equal the earnings our investees retain.\n************\nIn our earlier estimate of Berkshire’s normal earning power, we made three adjustments that relate to\nfuture investment income (but did notinclude anything for the undistributed earnings factor I have just\ndescribed).\nThe first adjustment was decidedly negative. Last year, we discussed five large fixed-income\ninvestments that have been contributing substantial sums to our reported earnings. One of these – our Swiss Renote – was redeemed in the early days of 2011, and two others – our Goldman Sachs and General Electricpreferred stocks – are likely to be gone by yearend. General Electric is entitled to call our preferred in Octoberand has stated its intention to do so. Goldman Sachs has the right to call our preferred on 30 days notice, but hasbeen held back by the Federal Reserve (bless it!), which unfortunately will likely give Goldman the green lightbefore long.\n17\n\nAll three of the companies redeeming must pay us a premium to do so – in aggregate about $1.4 billion –\nbut all of the redemptions are nevertheless unwelcome. After they occur, our earning power will be significantly\nreduced. That’s the bad news.\nThere are two probable offsets. At yearend we held $38 billion of cash equivalents that have been\nearning a pittance throughout 2010. At some point, however, better rates will return. They will add at least$500 million – and perhaps much more – to our investment income. That sort of increase in money-market yieldsis unlikely to come soon. It is appropriate, nevertheless, for us to include improved rates in an estimate of“normal” earning power. Even before higher rates come about, furthermore, we could get lucky and find anopportunity to use some of our cash hoard at decent returns. That day can’t come too soon for me: To updateAesop, a girl in a convertible is worth five in the phone book.\nIn addition, dividends on our current common stock holdings will almost certainly increase. The largest\ngain is likely to come at Wells Fargo. The Federal Reserve, our friend in respect to Goldman Sachs, has frozendividend levels at major banks, whether strong or weak, during the last two years. Wells Fargo, thoughconsistently prospering throughout the worst of the recession and currently enjoying enormous financial strengthand earning power, has therefore been forced to maintain an artificially low payout. (We don’t fault the Fed: Forvarious reasons, an across-the-board freeze made sense during the crisis and its immediate aftermath.)\nAt some point, probably soon, the Fed’s restrictions will cease. Wells Fargo can then reinstate the\nrational dividend policy that its owners deserve. At that time, we would expect our annual dividends from justthis one security to increase by several hundreds of millions of dollars annually.\nOther companies we hold are likely to increase their dividends as well. Coca-Cola paid us $88 million\nin 1995, the year after we finished purchasing the stock. Every year since, Coke has increased its dividend. In2011, we will almost certainly receive $376 million from Coke, up $24 million from last year. Within ten years, Iwould expect that $376 million to double. By the end of that period, I wouldn’t be surprised to see our share ofCoke’s annual earnings exceed 100% of what we paid for the investment. Time is the friend of the wonderful\nbusiness.\nOverall, I believe our “normal” investment income will at least equal what we realized in 2010, though\nthe redemptions I described will cut our take in 2011 and perhaps 2012 as well.\n************\nLast summer, Lou Simpson told me he wished to retire. Since Lou was a mere 74 – an age Charlie and\nI regard as appropriate only for trainees at Berkshire – his call was a surprise.\nLou joined GEICO as its investment manager in 1979, and his service to that company has been\ninvaluable. In the 2004 Annual Report, I detailed his record with equities, and I have omitted updates onlybecause his performance made mine look bad. Who needs that?\nLou has never been one to advertise his talents. But I will: Simply put, Lou is one of the investment\ngreats. We will miss him.\n************\nFour years ago, I told you that we needed to add one or more younger investment managers to carry on\nwhen Charlie, Lou and I weren’t around. At that time we had multiple outstanding candidates immediatelyavailable for my CEO job (as we do now), but we did not have backup in the investment area.\nIt’s easy to identify many investment managers with great recent records. But past results, though\nimportant, do not suffice when prospective performance is being judged. How the record has been achieved iscrucial, as is the manager’s understanding of – and sensitivity to – risk (which in no way should be measured bybeta, the choice of too many academics). In respect to the risk criterion, we were looking for someone with ahard-to-evaluate skill: the ability to anticipate the effects of economic scenarios not previously observed. Finally,we wanted someone who would regard working for Berkshire as far more than a job.\n18\n\nWhen Charlie and I met Todd Combs, we knew he fit our requirements. Todd, as was the case with\nLou, will be paid a salary plus a contingent payment based on his performance relative to the S&P. We have\narrangements in place for deferrals and carryforwards that will prevent see-saw performance being met byundeserved payments. The hedge-fund world has witnessed some terrible behavior by general partners who havereceived huge payouts on the upside and who then, when bad results occurred, have walked away rich, with theirlimited partners losing back their earlier gains. Sometimes these same general partners thereafter quickly startedanother fund so that they could immediately participate in future profits without having to overcome their pastlosses. Investors who put money with such managers should be labeled patsies, not partners.\nAs long as I am CEO, I will continue to manage the great majority of Berkshire’s holdings, both bonds\nand equities. Todd initially will manage funds in the range of one to three billion dollars, an amount he can resetannually. His focus will be equities but he is not restricted to that form of investment. (Fund consultants like torequire style boxes such as “long-short,” “macro,” “international equities.” At Berkshire our only style box is“smart.”)\nOver time, we may add one or two investment managers if we find the right individuals. Should we do\nthat, we will probably have 80% of each manager’s performance compensation be dependent on his or her ownportfolio and 20% on that of the other manager(s). We want a compensation system that pays off big forindividual success but that also fosters cooperation, not competition.\nWhen Charlie and I are no longer around, our investment manager(s) will have responsibility for the\nentire portfolio in a manner then set by the CEO and Board of Directors. Because good investors bring a usefulperspective to the purchase of businesses, we would expect them to be consulted – but not to have a vote – on thewisdom of possible acquisitions. In the end, of course, the Board will make the call on any major acquisition.\nOne footnote: When we issued a press release about Todd’s joining us, a number of commentators\npointed out that he was “little-known” and expressed puzzlement that we didn’t seek a “big-name.” I wonderhow many of them would have known of Lou in 1979, Ajit in 1985, or, for that matter, Charlie in 1959. Our goalwas to find a 2-year-old Secretariat, not a 10-year-old Seabiscuit. (Whoops – that may not be the smartestmetaphor for an 80-year-old CEO to use.)\nDerivatives\nTwo years ago, in the 2008 Annual Report, I told you that Berkshire was a party to 251 derivatives\ncontracts (other than those used for operations at our subsidiaries, such as MidAmerican, and the few left over at\nGen Re). Today, the comparable number is 203, a figure reflecting both a few additions to our portfolio and theunwinding or expiration of some contracts.\nOur continuing positions, all of which I am personally responsible for, fall largely into two categories.\nWe view both categories as engaging us in insurance-like activities in which we receive premiums for assumingrisks that others wish to shed. Indeed, the thought processes we employ in these derivatives transactions areidentical to those we use in our insurance business. You should also understand that we get paid up-front whenwe enter into the contracts and therefore run no counterparty risk. That’s important.\nOur first category of derivatives consists of a number of contracts, written in 2004-2008, that required\npayments by us if there were bond defaults by companies included in certain high-yield indices. With minorexceptions, we were exposed to these risks for five years, with each contract covering 100 companies.\nIn aggregate, we received premiums of $3.4 billion for these contracts. When I originally told you in\nour 2007 Annual Report about them, I said that I expected the contracts would deliver us an “underwritingprofit,” meaning that our losses would be less than the premiums we received. In addition, I said we wouldbenefit from the use of float.\n19\n\nSubsequently, as you know too well, we encountered both a financial panic and a severe recession. A\nnumber of the companies in the high-yield indices failed, which required us to pay losses of $2.5 billion. Today,\nhowever, our exposure is largely behind us because most of our higher-risk contracts have expired. Consequently, itappears almost certain that we will earn an underwriting profit as we originally anticipated. In addition, we have hadthe use of interest-free float that averaged about $2 billion over the life of the contracts. In short, we charged theright premium, and that protected us when business conditions turned terrible three years ago.\nOur other large derivatives position – whose contracts go by the name of “equity puts” – involves\ninsurance we wrote for parties wishing to protect themselves against a possible decline in equity prices in theU.S., U.K., Europe and Japan. These contracts are tied to various equity indices, such as the S&P 500 in the U.S.and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. In the 2004-2008 period, we received $4.8 billion of premiums for 47 of thesecontracts, most of which ran for 15 years. On these contracts, only the price of the indices on the termination datecounts: No payments can be required before then.\nAs a first step in updating you about these contracts, I can report that late in 2010, at the instigation of\nour counterparty, we unwound eight contracts, all of them due between 2021 and 2028. We had originallyreceived $647 million in premiums for these contracts, and the unwinding required us to pay $425 million.Consequently, we realized a gain of $222 million and also had the interest-free and unrestricted use of that$647 million for about three years.\nThose 2010 transactions left us with 39 equity put contracts remaining on our books at yearend. On\nthese, at their initiation, we received premiums of $4.2 billion.\nThe future of these contracts is, of course, uncertain. But here is one perspective on them. If the prices\nof the relevant indices are the same at the contract expiration dates as these prices were on December 31, 2010 –and foreign exchange rates are unchanged – we would owe $3.8 billion on expirations occurring from 2018 to2026. You can call this amount “settlement value.”\nOn our yearend balance sheet, however, we carry the liability for those remaining equity puts at\n$6.7 billion. In other words, if the prices of the relevant indices remain unchanged from that date, we will recorda $2.9 billion gain in the years to come, that being the difference between the liability figure of $6.7 billion andthe settlement value of $3.8 billion. I believe that equity prices will very likely increase and that our liability willfall significantly between now and settlement date. If so, our gain from this point will be even greater. But that,of course, is far from a sure thing.\nWhat is sure is that we will have the use of our remaining “float” of $4.2 billion for an average of about\n10 more years. (Neither this float nor that arising from the high-yield contracts is included in the insurance floatfigure of $66 billion.) Since money is fungible, think of a portion of these funds as contributing to the purchaseof BNSF.\nAs I have told you before, almost all of our derivatives contracts are free of any obligation to post\ncollateral – a fact that cut the premiums we could otherwise have charged. But that fact also left us feelingcomfortable during the financial crisis, allowing us in those days to commit to some advantageous purchases.Foregoing some additional derivatives premiums proved to be well worth it.\nOn Reporting and Misreporting: The Numbers That Count and Those That Don’t\nEarlier in this letter, I pointed out some numbers that Charlie and I find useful in valuing Berkshire and\nmeasuring its progress.\nLet’s focus here on a number we omitted, but which many in the media feature above all others: net\nincome. Important though that number may be at most companies, it is almost always meaningless at Berkshire.\nRegardless of how our businesses might be doing, Charlie and I could – quite legally – cause net income in any\ngiven period to be almost any number we would like.\n20\n\nWe have that flexibility because realized gains or losses on investments go into the net income figure,\nwhereas unrealized gains (and, in most cases, losses) are excluded. For example, imagine that Berkshire had a\n$10 billion increase in unrealized gains in a given year and concurrently had $1 billion of realized losses. Our net\nincome – which would count only the loss – would be reported as lessthan our operating income. If we had\nmeanwhile realized gains in the previous year, headlines might proclaim that our earnings were down X% when\nin reality our business might be much improved.\nIf we really thought net income important, we could regularly feed realized gains into it simply because\nwe have a huge amount of unrealized gains upon which to draw. Rest assured, though, that Charlie and I havenever sold a security because of the effect a sale would have on the net income we were soon to report. We both\nhave a deep disgust for “game playing” with numbers, a practice that was rampant throughout corporate Americain the 1990s and still persists, though it occurs less frequently and less blatantly than it used to.\nOperating earnings, despite having some shortcomings, are in general a reasonable guide as to how our\nbusinesses are doing. Ignore our net income figure, however. Regulations require that we report it to you. But ifyou find reporters focusing on it, that will speak more to their performance than ours.\nBoth realized and unrealized gains and losses are fully reflected in the calculation of our book value.\nPay attention to the changes in that metric and to the course of our operating earnings, and you will be on theright track.\n************\nAs a p.s., I can’t resist pointing out just how capricious reported net income can be. Had our equity puts\nhad a termination date of June 30, 2010, we would have been required to pay $6.4 billion to our counterparties atthat date. Security prices then generally rose in the next quarter, a move that brought the corresponding figuredown to $5.8 billion on September 30th. Yet the Black-Scholes formula that we use in valuing these contractsrequired us to increase our balance-sheet liability during this period from $8.9 billion to $9.6 billion, a change\nthat, after the effect of tax accruals, reduced our net income for the quarter by $455 million.\nBoth Charlie and I believe that Black-Scholes produces wildly inappropriate values when applied to\nlong-dated options. We set out one absurd example in these pages two years ago. More tangibly, we put ourmoney where our mouth was by entering into our equity put contracts. By doing so, we implicitly asserted thatthe Black-Scholes calculations used by our counterparties or their customers were faulty.\nWe continue, nevertheless, to use that formula in presenting our financial statements. Black-Scholes is\nthe accepted standard for option valuation – almost all leading business schools teach it – and we would beaccused of shoddy accounting if we deviated from it. Moreover, we would present our auditors with aninsurmountable problem were we to do that: They have clients who are our counterparties and who use Black-Scholes values for the same contracts we hold. It would be impossible for our auditors to attest to the accuracy ofboth their values and ours were the two far apart.\nPart of the appeal of Black-Scholes to auditors and regulators is that it produces a precise number.\nCharlie and I can’t supply one of those. We believe the true liability of our contracts to be far lower than thatcalculated by Black-Scholes, but we can’t come up with an exact figure – anymore than we can come up with aprecise value for GEICO, BNSF, or for Berkshire Hathaway itself. Our inability to pinpoint a number doesn’t\nbother us: We would rather be approximately right than precisely wrong.\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith once slyly observed that economists were most economical with ideas: They\nmade the ones learned in graduate school last a lifetime. University finance departments often behave similarly.Witness the tenacity with which almost all clung to the theory of efficient markets throughout the 1970s and1980s, dismissively calling powerful facts that refuted it “anomalies.” (I always love explanations of that kind:The Flat Earth Society probably views a ship’s circling of the globe as an annoying, but inconsequential,anomaly.)\n21\n\nAcademics’ current practice of teaching Black-Scholes as revealed truth needs re-examination. For that\nmatter, so does the academic’s inclination to dwell on the valuation of options. You can be highly successful as\nan investor without having the slightest ability to value an option. What students should be learning is how to\nvalue a business. That’s what investing is all about.\nLife and Debt\nThe fundamental principle of auto racing is that to finish first, you must first finish. That dictum is\nequally applicable to business and guides our every action at Berkshire.\nUnquestionably, some people have become very rich through the use of borrowed money. However,\nthat’s also been a way to get very poor. When leverage works, it magnifies your gains. Your spouse thinks you’re\nclever, and your neighbors get envious. But leverage is addictive. Once having profited from its wonders, veryfew people retreat to more conservative practices. And as we all learned in third grade – and some relearned in2008 – any series of positive numbers, however impressive the numbers may be, evaporates when multiplied by asingle zero. History tells us that leverage all too often produces zeroes, even when it is employed by very smartpeople.\nLeverage, of course, can be lethal to businesses as well. Companies with large debts often assume that\nthese obligations can be refinanced as they mature. That assumption is usually valid. Occasionally, though, eitherbecause of company-specific problems or a worldwide shortage of credit, maturities must actually be met bypayment. For that, only cash will do the job.\nBorrowers then learn that credit is like oxygen. When either is abundant, its presence goes unnoticed.\nWhen either is missing, that’s allthat is noticed. Even a short absence of credit can bring a company to its knees.\nIn September 2008, in fact, its overnight disappearance in many sectors of the economy came dangerously closeto bringing our entire country to its knees.\nCharlie and I have nointerest in any activity that could pose the slightest threat to Berkshire’s well-\nbeing. (With our having a combined age of 167, starting over is not on our bucket list.) We are forever consciousof the fact that you, our partners, have entrusted us with what in many cases is a major portion of your savings. Inaddition, important philanthropy is dependent on our prudence. Finally, many disabled victims of accidentscaused by our insureds are counting on us to deliver sums payable decades from now. It would be irresponsiblefor us to risk what all these constituencies need just to pursue a few points of extra return.\nA little personal history may partially explain our extreme aversion to financial adventurism. I didn’t\nmeet Charlie until he was 35, though he grew up within 100 yards of where I have lived for 52 years and alsoattended the same inner-city public high school in Omaha from which my father, wife, children and twograndchildren graduated. Charlie and I did, however, both work as young boys at my grandfather’s grocery store,though our periods of employment were separated by about five years. My grandfather’s name was Ernest, andperhaps no man was more aptly named. No one worked for Ernest, even as a stock boy, without being shaped bythe experience.\nOn the facing page you can read a letter sent in 1939 by Ernest to his youngest son, my Uncle Fred.\nSimilar letters went to his other four children. I still have the letter sent to my Aunt Alice, which I found – alongwith $1,000 of cash – when, as executor of her estate, I opened her safe deposit box in 1970.\nErnest never went to business school – he never in fact finished high school – but he understood the\nimportance of liquidity as a condition for assured survival. At Berkshire, we have taken his $1,000 solution a bit\nfurther and have pledged that we will hold at least $10 billion of cash, excluding that held at our regulated utilityand railroad businesses. Because of that commitment, we customarily keep at least $20 billion on hand so that wecan both withstand unprecedented insurance losses (our largest to date having been about $3 billion from Katrina,the insurance industry’s most expensive catastrophe) and quickly seize acquisition or investment opportunities,even during times of financial turmoil.\n22\n\n23\n\nWe keep our cash largely in U.S. Treasury bills and avoid other short-term securities yielding a few\nmore basis points, a policy we adhered to long before the frailties of commercial paper and money market funds\nbecame apparent in September 2008. We agree with investment writer Ray DeVoe’s observation, “More moneyhas been lost reaching for yield than at the point of a gun.” At Berkshire, we don’t rely on bank lines, and wedon’t enter into contracts that could require postings of collateral except for amounts that are tiny in relation toour liquid assets.\nFurthermore, not a dime of cash has left Berkshire for dividends or share repurchases during the past\n40 years. Instead, we have retained allof our earnings to strengthen our business, a reinforcement now running\nabout $1 billion per month. Our net worth has thus increased from $48 million to $157 billion during those fourdecades and our intrinsic value has grown far more. No other American corporation has come close to buildingup its financial strength in this unrelenting way.\nBy being so cautious in respect to leverage, we penalize our returns by a minor amount. Having loads of\nliquidity, though, lets us sleep well. Moreover, during the episodes of financial chaos that occasionally erupt in oureconomy, we will be equipped both financially and emotionally to play offense while others scramble for survival.That’s what allowed us to invest $15.6 billion in 25 days of panic following the Lehman bankruptcy in 2008.\nThe Annual Meeting\nThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, April 30\nth. Carrie Kizer from our home office will be the\nringmaster, and her theme this year is Planes, Trains and Automobiles. This gives NetJets, BNSF and BYD a\nchance to show off.\nAs always, the doors will open at the Qwest Center at 7 a.m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at\n8:30. At 9:30 we will go directly to the question-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest’sstands) will last until 3:30. After a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decideto leave during the day’s question periods, please do so while Charlie is talking. (Act fast; he can be terse.)\nThe best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We will help you do that by filling the 194,300-square-\nfoot hall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you didyour part, and most locations racked up record sales. In a nine-hour period, we sold 1,053 pairs of Justin boots,12,416 pounds of See’s candy, 8,000 Dairy Queen Blizzards\n®and 8,800 Quikut knives (that’s 16 knives per\nminute). But you can do better. Remember: Anyone who says money can’t buy happiness simply hasn’t learnedwhere to shop.\nGEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of\nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you ashareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which weoperate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that givencertain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. Forat least half of you, I believe we can.\nBe sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry more than 60 books and DVDs, including the Chinese\nlanguage edition of Poor Charlie’s Almanack, the ever-popular book about my partner. So what if you can’t readChinese? Just buy a copy and carry it around; it will make you look urbane and erudite. Should you need to shipyour book purchases, a shipping service will be available nearby.\nIf you are a big spender – or merely a gawker – visit Elliott Aviation on the east side of the Omaha\nairport between noon and 5:00 p.m. on Saturday. There we will have a fleet of NetJets aircraft that will get yourpulse racing. Come by bus; leave by private jet.\n24\n\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. As for plane, hotel and car reservations,\nwe have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. Carol Pedersen, whohandles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it. Hotel rooms can be hard to find,but work with Carol and you will get one.\nAirlines have often jacked up prices – sometimes dramatically so – for the Berkshire weekend. If you\nare coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City versus Omaha. The drive is about 2\n1⁄2hours\nand it may be that you can save significant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha.\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72ndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we\nwill again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. Last year the store did $33.3 million of businessduring its annual meeting sale, a volume that – as far as I know – exceeds the one-week total of anyretail store\nanyplace. To obtain the Berkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, April 26\nthand\nMonday, May 2ndinclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even\napply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules againstdiscounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you.We appreciate their cooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m.to 6 p.m. on Sunday. On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a picnic to which you areall invited.\nAt Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception\nf r o m6p . m .t o9p . m .o nF r i d a y ,A p r i l2 9\nth. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 1st, from\n9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. On Sunday, around 1 p.m., I will be at Borsheimswith a smile and a shoeshine, selling jewelry just as I sold men’s shirts at J.C. Penney’s 63 years ago.I’ve told Susan Jacques, Borsheims’ CEO, that I’m still a hotshot salesman. But I see doubt in her eyes.So cut loose and buy something from me for your wife or sweetheart (presumably the same person). Make melook good.\nWe will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 25\nththrough Saturday, May 7th. During that period,\nplease identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement thatshows you are a Berkshire shareholder.\nOn Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion,\nwill take on all comers – who will have their eyes wide open – in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, aremarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and SharonOsberg, two of the world’s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sundayafternoon.\nGorat’s and Piccolo’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 1\nst.\nBoth will be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat’s opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo’s opening at 4 p.m. Theserestaurants are my favorites and – still being a growing boy – I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening.Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call 402-551-3733 on April 1\nst(but not before ) and at Piccolo’s\ncall 402-342-9038.\nWe will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period, asking\nCharlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mailaddresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be emailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com; Becky Quick, ofCNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com, and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, atarsorkin@nytimes.com.\nFrom the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the dozen or so he or she decides are the\nmost interesting and important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selectedif you keep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more thantwo questions in any email you send them. (In your email, let the journalist know if you would like your namementioned if your question is selected.)\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the\njournalists will pick some tough ones, and that’s the way we like it.\n25\n\nWe will again have a drawing at 8:15 a.m. on Saturday at each of 13 microphones for those\nshareholders wishing to ask questions themselves. At the meeting, I will alternate the questions asked by the\njournalists with those from the winning shareholders. We hope to answer at least 60 questions. From ourstandpoint, the more the better. Our goal, which we pursue both through these annual letters and by our meetingdiscussions, is to give you a better understanding of the business that youown.\n************\nFor good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. Equally important,\nhowever, are the 20 men and women who work with me at our corporate office (all on one floor, which is theway we intend to keep it!).\nThis group efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 14,097-\npage Federal income tax return along with state and foreign returns, responds to countless shareholder and mediainquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country’s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board’sactivities – and the list goes on and on.\nThey handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life\neasy and joyful. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: They deal with 48 universities(selected from 200 applicants) who will send students to Omaha this school year for a day with me and alsohandle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers for lunch. No CEO hasit better.\nThis home office crew has my deepest thanks and deserves yours as well. Come to our Woodstock for\nCapitalism on April 30\nthand tell them so.\nFebruary 26, 2011 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board\n26\n\nMemo\nTo: Berkshire Hathaway Managers (“The All-Stars”)\ncc: Berkshire Directors\nFrom: Warren E. Buffett\nDate: July 26, 2010\nThis is my biennial letter to reemphasize Berkshire’s top priority and to get your help on\nsuccession planning (yours, not mine!).\nThe priority is that all of us continue to zealously guard Berkshire’s reputation. We can’t be\nperfect but we can try to be. As I’ve said in these memos for more than 25 years: “We can afford to lose\nmoney – even a lot of money. But we can’t afford to lose reputation – even a shred of reputation.” Wemust continue to measure every act against not only what is legal but also what we would be happy to have\nwritten about on the front page of a national newspaper in an article written by an unfriendly but intelligentreporter.\nSometimes your associates will say “Everybody else is doing it.” This rationale is almost always\na bad one if it is the main justification for a business action. It is totally unacceptable when evaluating amoral decision. Whenever somebody offers that phrase as a rationale, in effect they are saying that theycan’t come up with a good reason. If anyone gives this explanation, tell them to try using it with a reporter\nor a judge and see how far it gets them.\nIf you see anything whose propriety or legality causes you to hesitate, be sure to give me a call.\nHowever, it’s very likely that if a given course of action evokes such hesitation, it’s too close to the lineand should be abandoned. There’s plenty of money to be made in the center of the court. If it’squestionable whether some action is close to the line, just assume it is outside and forget it.\nAs a corollary, let me know promptly if there’s any significant bad news. I can handle bad news\nbut I don’t like to deal with it after it has festered for awhile. A reluctance to face up immediately to badnews is what turned a problem at Salomon from one that could have easily been disposed of into one thatalmost caused the demise of a firm with 8,000 employees.\n104\n\nSomebody is doing something today at Berkshire that you and I would be unhappy about if we\nknew of it. That’s inevitable: We now employ more than 250,000 people and the chances of that number\ngetting through the day without any bad behavior occurring is nil. But we can have a huge effect inminimizing such activities by jumping on anything immediately when there is the slightest odor ofimpropriety. Your attitude on such matters, expressed by behavior as well as words, will be the mostimportant factor in how the culture of your business develops. Culture, more than rule books, determineshow an organization behaves.\nIn other respects, talk to me about what is going on as little or as much as you wish. Each of you\ndoes a first-class job of running your operation with your own individual style and you don’t need me tohelp. The only items you need to clear with me are any changes in post-retirement benefits and anyunusually large capital expenditures or acquisitions.\n************\nI need your help in respect to the question of succession. I’m not looking for any of you to retire\nand I hope you all live to 100. (In Charlie’s case, 110.) But just in case you don’t, please send me a letter(at home if you wish) giving your recommendation as who should take over tomorrow if you shouldbecome incapacitated overnight. These letters will be seen by no one but me unless I’m no longer CEO, inwhich case my successor will need the information. Please summarize the strengths and weaknesses ofyour primary candidate as well as any possible alternates you may wish to include. Most of you haveparticipated in this exercise in the past and others have offered your ideas verbally. However, it’simportant to me to get a periodic update, and now that we have added so many businesses, I need to haveyour thoughts in writing rather than trying to carry them around in my memory. Of course, there are a fewoperations that are run by two or more of you – such as the Blumkins, the Merschmans, the pair at AppliedUnderwriters, etc. – and in these cases, just forget about this item. Your note can be short, informal,handwritten, etc. Just mark it “Personal for Warren.”\nThanks for your help on all of this. And thanks for the way you run your businesses. You make\nmy job easy.\nWEB/dbP.S. Another minor request: Please turn down all proposals for me to speak, make contributions, intercede\nwith the Gates Foundation, etc. Sometimes these requests for you to act as intermediary will beaccompanied by “It can’t hurt to ask.” It will be easier for both of us if you just say “no.” As an addedfavor, don’t suggest that they instead write or call me. Multiply 76 businesses by the periodic “I think he’llbe interested in this one” and you can understand why it is better to say no firmly and immediately.\n105",

Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold atmarket rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire’sresults through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculatedusing the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-\ntax. If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its\nresults would have lagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded theS&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused theaggregate lag to be substantial.\n2\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nThe per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock increased by 4.6% in 2011. Over the\nlast 47 years (that is, since present management took over), book value has grown from $19 to $99,860, a rate of19.8% compounded annually.*\nCharlie Munger, Berkshire’s Vice Chairman and my partner, and I feel good about the company’s\nprogress during 2011. Here are the highlights:\n• The primary job of a Board of Directors is to see that the right people are running the business and to\nbe sure that the next generation of leaders is identified and ready to take over tomorrow . I have been on\n19 corporate boards, and Berkshire’s directors are at the top of the list in the time and diligence theyhave devoted to succession planning. What’s more, their efforts have paid off.\nAs 2011 started, Todd Combs joined us as an investment manager, and shortly after yearend Ted\nWeschler came aboard. Both of these men have outstanding investment skills and a deep commitmentto Berkshire. Each will be handling a few billion dollars in 2012, but they have the brains, judgmentand character to manage our entire portfolio when Charlie and I are no longer running Berkshire.\nYour Board is equally enthusiastic about my successor as CEO, an individual to whom they have had a\ngreat deal of exposure and whose managerial and human qualities they admire. (We have two superbback-up candidates as well.) When a transfer of responsibility is required, it will be seamless, andBerkshire’s prospects will remain bright. More than 98% of my net worth is in Berkshire stock, all ofwhich will go to various philanthropies. Being so heavily concentrated in one stock defies conventionalwisdom. But I’m fine with this arrangement, knowing both the quality and diversity of the businesseswe own and the caliber of the people who manage them. With these assets, my successor will enjoy arunning start. Do not, however, infer from this discussion that Charlie and I are going anywhere; wecontinue to be in excellent health, and we love what we do.\n• On September 16\nthwe acquired Lubrizol, a worldwide producer of additives and other specialty\nchemicals. The company has had an outstanding record since James Hambrick became CEO in 2004,with pre-tax profits increasing from $147 million to $1,085 million. Lubrizol will have manyopportunities for “bolt-on” acquisitions in the specialty chemical field. Indeed, we’ve already agreed tothree, costing $493 million. James is a disciplined buyer and a superb operator. Charlie and I are eagerto expand his managerial domain.\n• Our major businesses did well last year. In fact, each of our five largest non-insurance companies – BNSF,\nIscar, Lubrizol, Marmon Group and MidAmerican Energy – delivered record operating earnings. Inaggregate these businesses earned more than $9 billion pre-tax in 2011. Contrast that to seven years ago,when we owned only one of the five, MidAmerican, whose pre-tax earnings were $393 million. Unless theeconomy weakens in 2012, each of our fabulous five should again set a record, with aggregate earnings\ncomfortably topping $10 billion.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are\n1/1500thof those shown for A.\n3\n\n• In total, our entire string of operating companies spent $8.2 billion for property, plant and equipment in\n2011, smashing our previous record by more than $2 billion. About 95% of these outlays were made inthe U.S., a fact that may surprise those who believe our country lacks investment opportunities. Wewelcome projects abroad, but expect the overwhelming majority of Berkshire’s future capitalcommitments to be in America. In 2012, these expenditures will again set a record.\n• Our insurance operations continued their delivery of costless capital that funds a myriad of other\nopportunities. This business produces “float” – money that doesn’t belong to us, but that we get toinvest for Berkshire’s benefit. And if we pay out less in losses and expenses than we receive inpremiums, we additionally earn an underwriting profit, meaning the float costs us less than nothing.Though we are sure to have underwriting losses from time to time, we’ve now had nine consecutiveyears of underwriting profits, totaling about $17 billion. Over the same nine years our float increasedfrom $41 billion to its current record of $70 billion. Insurance has been good to us.\n• Finally, we made two major investments in marketable securities: (1) a $5 billion 6% preferred stock of\nBank of America that came with warrants allowing us to buy 700 million common shares at $7.14 pershare any time before September 2, 2021; and (2) 63.9 million shares of IBM that cost us $10.9 billion.Counting IBM, we now have large ownership interests in four exceptional companies: 13.0% ofAmerican Express, 8.8% of Coca-Cola, 5.5% of IBM and 7.6% of Wells Fargo. (We also, of course,have many smaller, but important, positions.)\nWe view these holdings as partnership interests in wonderful businesses, not as marketable securities to\nbe bought or sold based on their near-term prospects. Our share of their earnings, however, are far from\nfully reflected in ourearnings; only the dividends we receive from these businesses show up in our\nfinancial reports. Over time, though, the undistributed earnings of these companies that are attributableto our ownership are of huge importance to us. That’s because they will be used in a variety of ways toincrease future earnings and dividends of the investee. They may also be devoted to stock repurchases,which will increase our share of the company’s future earnings.\nHad we owned our present positions throughout last year, our dividends from the “Big Four” would\nhave been $862 million. That’s all that would have been reported in Berkshire’s income statement. Ourshare of this quartet’s earnings, however, would have been far greater: $3.3 billion. Charlie and Ibelieve that the $2.4 billion that goes unreported on our books creates at least that amount of value forBerkshire as it fuels earnings gains in future years. We expect the combined earnings of the four – andtheir dividends as well – to increase in 2012 and, for that matter, almost every year for a long time tocome. A decade from now, our current holdings of the four companies might well account for earningsof $7 billion, of which $2 billion in dividends would come to us.\nI’ve run out of good news. Here are some developments that hurt us during 2011:\n• A few years back, I spent about $2 billion buying several bond issues of Energy Future Holdings, an\nelectric utility operation serving portions of Texas. That was a mistake – a bigmistake. In large measure,\nthe company’s prospects were tied to the price of natural gas, which tanked shortly after our purchase andremains depressed. Though we have annually received interest payments of about $102 million since ourpurchase, the company’s ability to pay will soon be exhausted unless gas prices rise substantially. Wewrote down our investment by $1 billion in 2010 and by an additional $390 million last year.\nAt yearend, we carried the bonds at their market value of $878 million. If gas prices remain at present\nlevels, we will likely face a further loss, perhaps in an amount that will virtually wipe out our currentcarrying value. Conversely, a substantial increase in gas prices might allow us to recoup some, or evenall, of our write-down. However things turn out, I totally miscalculated the gain/loss probabilities whenI purchased the bonds. In tennis parlance, this was a major unforced error by your chairman.\n4\n\n• Three large and very attractive fixed-income investments were called away from us by their issuers in\n2011. Swiss Re, Goldman Sachs and General Electric paid us an aggregate of $12.8 billion to redeemsecurities that were producing about $1.2 billion of pre-tax earnings for Berkshire. That’s a lot ofincome to replace, though our Lubrizol purchase did offset most of it.\n• Last year, I told you that “a housing recovery will probably begin within a year or so.” I was dead\nwrong. We have five businesses whose results are significantly influenced by housing activity. Theconnection is direct at Clayton Homes, which is the largest producer of homes in the country,accounting for about 7% of those constructed during 2011.\nAdditionally, Acme Brick, Shaw (carpet), Johns Manville (insulation) and MiTek (building products,\nprimarily connector plates used in roofing) are all materially affected by construction activity. Inaggregate, our five housing-related companies had pre-tax profits of $513 million in 2011. That’ssimilar to 2010 but down from $1.8 billion in 2006.\nHousing will come back – you can be sure of that. Over time, the number of housing units necessarily\nmatches the number of households (after allowing for a normal level of vacancies). For a period ofyears prior to 2008, however, America added more housing units than households. Inevitably, weended up with far too many units and the bubble popped with a violence that shook the entire economy.That created still another problem for housing: Early in a recession, household formations slow, and in2009 the decrease was dramatic.\nThat devastating supply/demand equation is now reversed: Every day we are creating more households\nthan housing units. People may postpone hitching up during uncertain times, but eventually hormonestake over. And while “doubling-up” may be the initial reaction of some during a recession, living within-laws can quickly lose its allure.\nAt our current annual pace of 600,000 housing starts – considerably less than the number of new\nhouseholds being formed – buyers and renters are sopping up what’s left of the old oversupply. (Thisprocess will run its course at different rates around the country; the supply-demand situation varieswidely by locale.) While this healing takes place, however, our housing-related companies sputter,employing only 43,315 people compared to 58,769 in 2006. This hugely important sector of theeconomy, which includes not only construction but everything that feeds off of it, remains in adepression of its own. I believe this is the major reason a recovery in employment has so severely\nlagged the steady and substantial comeback we have seen in almost all other sectors of our economy.\nWise monetary and fiscal policies play an important role in tempering recessions, but these tools don’t\ncreate households nor eliminate excess housing units. Fortunately, demographics and our marketsystem will restore the needed balance – probably before long. When that day comes, we will againbuild one million or more residential units annually. I believe pundits will be surprised at how farunemployment drops once that happens. They will then reawake to what has been true since 1776:America’s best days lie ahead.\nIntrinsic Business Value\nCharlie and I measure our performance by the rate of gain in Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic business\nvalue. If our gain over time outstrips the performance of the S&P 500, we have earned our paychecks. If itdoesn’t, we are overpaid at any price.\nWe have no way to pinpoint intrinsic value. But we do have a useful, though considerably understated ,\nproxy for it: per-share book value. This yardstick is meaningless at most companies. At Berkshire, however,book value very roughly tracks business values. That’s because the amount by which Berkshire’s intrinsic valueexceeds book value does not swing wildly from year to year, though it increases in most years. Over time, thedivergence will likely become ever more substantial in absolute terms, remaining reasonably steady, however, ona percentage basis as both the numerator and denominator of the business-value/book-value equation increase.\n5\n\nWe’ve regularly emphasized that our book-value performance is almost certain to outpace the S&P 500\nin a bad year for the stock market and just as certainly will fall short in a strong up-year. The test is how we doover time. Last year’s annual report included a table laying out results for the 42 five-year periods since we tookover at Berkshire in 1965 (i.e., 1965-69, 1966-70, etc.). All showed our book value beating the S&P, and ourstring held for 2007-11. It will almost certainly snap, though, if the S&P 500 should put together a five-yearwinning streak (which it may well be on its way to doing as I write this).\n************\nI also included two tables last year that set forth the key quantitative ingredients that will help you\nestimate our per-share intrinsic value. I won’t repeat the full discussion here; you can find it reproduced onpages 99-100. To update the tables shown there, our per-share investments in 2011 increased 4% to $98,366, andour pre-tax earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments increased 18% to $6,990 per share.\nCharlie and I like to see gains in both areas, but our primary focus is on building operating earnings. Over\ntime, the businesses we currently own should increase their aggregate earnings, and we hope also to purchase somelarge operations that will give us a further boost. We now have eight subsidiaries that would each be included in theFortune 500 were they stand-alone companies. That leaves only 492 to go. My task is clear, and I’m on the prowl.\nShare Repurchases\nLast September, we announced that Berkshire would repurchase its shares at a price of up to 110% of book\nvalue. We were in the market for only a few days – buying $67 million of stock – before the price advanced beyondour limit. Nonetheless, the general importance of share repurchases suggests I should focus for a bit on the subject.\nCharlie and I favor repurchases when two conditions are met: first, a company has ample funds to take\ncare of the operational and liquidity needs of its business; second, its stock is selling at a material discount to thecompany’s intrinsic business value, conservatively calculated.\nWe have witnessed many bouts of repurchasing that failed our second test. Sometimes, of course,\ninfractions – even serious ones – are innocent; many CEOs never stop believing their stock is cheap. In otherinstances, a less benign conclusion seems warranted. It doesn’t suffice to say that repurchases are being made tooffset the dilution from stock issuances or simply because a company has excess cash. Continuing shareholdersarehurt unless shares are purchased below intrinsic value. The first law of capital allocation – whether the\nmoney is slated for acquisitions or share repurchases – is that what is smart at one price is dumb at another. (OneCEO who always stresses the price/value factor in repurchase decisions is Jamie Dimon at J.P. Morgan; Irecommend that you read his annual letter.)\nCharlie and I have mixed emotions when Berkshire shares sell well below intrinsic value. We like\nmaking money for continuing shareholders, and there is no surer way to do that than by buying an asset – ourown stock – that we know to be worth at least x for less than that – for .9x, .8x or even lower. (As one of our\ndirectors says, it’s like shooting fish in a barrel, after the barrel has been drained and the fish have quit flopping.)\nNevertheless, we don’t enjoy cashing out partners at a discount, even though our doing so may give the sellingshareholders a slightly higher price than they would receive if our bid was absent. When we are buying,therefore, we want those exiting partners to be fully informed about the value of the assets they are selling.\nAt our limit price of 110% of book value, repurchases clearly increase Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic\nvalue. And the more and the cheaper we buy, the greater the gain for continuing shareholders. Therefore, if giventhe opportunity, we will likely repurchase stock aggressively at our price limit or lower. You should know,however, that we have no interest in supporting the stock and that our bids will fade in particularly weak markets.Nor will we buy shares if our cash-equivalent holdings are below $20 billion. At Berkshire, financial strengththat is unquestionable takes precedence over all else.\n************\nThis discussion of repurchases offers me the chance to address the irrational reaction of many investors\nto changes in stock prices. When Berkshire buys stock in a company that is repurchasing shares, we hope for twoevents: First, we have the normal hope that earnings of the business will increase at a good clip for a long time tocome; and second, we also hope that the stock underperforms in the market for a long time as well. A corollary to\nthis second point: “Talking our book” about a stock we own – were that to be effective – would actually beharmful to Berkshire, not helpful as commentators customarily assume.\n6\n\nLet’s use IBM as an example. As all business observers know, CEOs Lou Gerstner and Sam Palmisano\ndid a superb job in moving IBM from near-bankruptcy twenty years ago to its prominence today. Theiroperational accomplishments were truly extraordinary.\nBut their financial management was equally brilliant, particularly in recent years as the company’s\nfinancial flexibility improved. Indeed, I can think of no major company that has had better financial management, askill that has materially increased the gains enjoyed by IBM shareholders. The company has used debt wisely, madevalue-adding acquisitions almost exclusively for cash and aggressively repurchased its own stock.\nToday, IBM has 1.16 billion shares outstanding, of which we own about 63.9 million or 5.5%.\nNaturally, what happens to the company’s earnings over the next five years is of enormous importance to us.Beyond that, the company will likely spend $50 billion or so in those years to repurchase shares. Our quiz for theday: What should a long-term shareholder, such as Berkshire, cheer for during that period?\nI won’t keep you in suspense. We should wish for IBM’s stock price to languish throughout the five years.\nLet’s do the math. If IBM’s stock price averages, say, $200 during the period, the company will acquire\n250 million shares for its $50 billion. There would consequently be 910 million shares outstanding, and wewould own about 7% of the company. If the stock conversely sells for an average of $300 during the five-yearperiod, IBM will acquire only 167 million shares. That would leave about 990 million shares outstanding afterfive years, of which we would own 6.5%.\nIf IBM were to earn, say, $20 billion in the fifth year, our share of those earnings would be a full $100\nmillion greater under the “disappointing” scenario of a lower stock price than they would have been at the higherprice. At some later point our shares would be worth perhaps $1\n1⁄2billion more than if the “high-price”\nrepurchase scenario had taken place.\nThe logic is simple: If you are going to be a net buyer of stocks in the future, either directly with your own\nmoney or indirectly (through your ownership of a company that is repurchasing shares), you are hurt when stocks\nrise. You benefit when stocks swoon. Emotions , however, too often complicate the matter: Most people, including\nthose who will be net buyers in the future, take comfort in seeing stock prices advance. These shareholders resemblea commuter who rejoices after the price of gas increases, simply because his tank contains a day’s supply.\nCharlie and I don’t expect to win many of you over to our way of thinking – we’ve observed enough\nhuman behavior to know the futility of that – but we do want you to be aware of our personal calculus. And herea confession is in order: In my early days I, too, rejoiced when the market rose. Then I read Chapter Eight of BenGraham’s The Intelligent Investor , the chapter dealing with how investors should view fluctuations in stock\nprices. Immediately the scales fell from my eyes, and low prices became my friend. Picking up that book was oneof the luckiest moments in my life.\nIn the end, the success of our IBM investment will be determined primarily by its future earnings. But\nan important secondary factor will be how many shares the company purchases with the substantial sums it islikely to devote to this activity. And if repurchases ever reduce the IBM shares outstanding to 63.9 million, I willabandon my famed frugality and give Berkshire employees a paid holiday.\n************\nNow, let’s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet\nand income characteristics from the others. Lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. So we’ll presentthem as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them. Because we may be repurchasingBerkshire shares from some of you, we will offer our thoughts in each section as to how intrinsic value comparesto carrying value.\n7\n\nInsurance\nLet’s look first at insurance, Berkshire’s core operation and the engine that has propelled our expansion\nover the years.\nProperty-casualty (“P/C”) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases,\nsuch as those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. Thiscollect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go toothers. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire’s benefit. Though individual policies and claimscome and go, the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume.Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown, as the following table shows:\nYear\nFloat (in $ millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322011 70,571\nIt’s unlikely that our float will grow much – if at all – from its current level. That’s mainly because we\nalready have an outsized amount relative to our premium volume. Were there to be a decline in float, I will add,\nit would almost certainly be very gradual and therefore impose no unusual demand for funds on us.\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit occurs, we enjoy the use of freemoney – and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy\nresult creates intense competition, so vigorous in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole tooperate at a significant underwriting loss. For example, State Farm, by far the country’s largest insurer and a well-managed\ncompany besides, has incurred an underwriting loss in eight of the last eleven years. There area lot of ways to lose money in insurance, and the industry is resourceful in creating new ones.\nAs noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for nine\nconsecutive years, our gain for the period having totaled $17 billion. I believe it likely that we will continue tounderwrite profitably in most – though certainly not all – future years. If we accomplish that, our float will bebetter than cost-free. We will profit just as we would if some party deposited $70.6 billion with us, paid us a feefor holding its money and then let us invest its funds for our own benefit.\nSo how does this attractive float affect intrinsic value calculations? Our float is deducted in full as a\nliability in calculating Berkshire’s book value, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and were unable toreplenish it. But that’s an incorrect way to view float, which should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Iffloat is both costless and long-enduring, the true value of this liability is farlower than the accounting liability.\nPartially offsetting this overstated liability is $15.5 billion of “goodwill” attributable to our insurance\ncompanies that is included in book value as an asset. In effect, this goodwill represents the price we paid for thefloat-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing on its\ntrue value. If an insurance business produces large and sustained underwriting losses, any goodwill assetattributable to it should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\nFortunately, that’s not the case at Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\ninsurance goodwill – what wewould pay to purchase float of similar quality – to be far in excess of its historic\ncarrying value. The value of our float is one reason – a huge reason – why we believe Berkshire’s intrinsicbusiness value substantially exceeds book value.\nLet me emphasize once again that cost-free float is notan outcome to be expected for the P/C industry\nas a whole: We don’t think there is much “Berkshire-quality” float existing in the insurance world. In most years,including 2011, the industry’s premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the\n8\n\nindustry’s overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized by\nAmerican industry, a sorry performance almost certain to continue. Berkshire’s outstanding economics exist onlybecause we have some terrific managers running some extraordinary insurance operations. Let me tell you aboutthe major units.\n************\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, run by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks\nthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,most importantly, brains in a manner that is unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire torisks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are farmore conservative in that respect than\nmost large insurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from somemega-catastrophe – a loss about triple anything it has ever faced – Berkshire as a whole would likely record amoderate profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings. Concurrently, all other major insurers andreinsurers would be far in the red, and some would face insolvency.\nFrom a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $34 billion and\nsignificant underwriting profits, a feat that no CEO of any other insurer has come close to matching. By theseaccomplishments, he has added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire. Charlie would gladlytrade me for a second Ajit. Alas, there is none.\n************\nWe have another insurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively evaluate the likelihood of any exposureactually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that will deliver a profit, on average,after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if theappropriate premium can’t be obtained.\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can’t turn their back on business\nthat their competitors are eagerly writing. That old line, “The other guy is doing it so we must as well,” spellstrouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance. Indeed, a good underwriter needs an independentmindset akin to that of the senior citizen who received a call from his wife while driving home. “Albert, be careful,”she warned, “I just heard on the radio that there’s a car going the wrong way down the Interstate.” “Mabel, theydon’t know the half of it,” replied Albert, “It’s not just one car, there are hundreds of them.”\nTad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re’s\nhuge float has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, it will continue tobe. In the first few years after we acquired it, General Re was a major headache. Now it’s a treasure.\n************\nFinally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 61 years ago. GEICO is run by Tony\nNicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 50 years of service in 2011.\nGEICO’s much-envied record comes from Tony’s brilliant execution of a superb and almost-\nimpossible-to-replicate business model. During Tony’s 18-year tenure as CEO, our market share has grown from 2.0%to 9.3%. If it had instead remained static – as it had for more than a decade before he took over – our premium volumewould now be $3.3 billion rather than the $15.4 billion we attained in 2011. The extra value created by Tony and hisassociates is a major element in Berkshire’s excess of intrinsic value over book value.\nThere is still more than 90% of the auto-insurance market left for GEICO to rake in. Don’t bet against\nTony acquiring chunks of it year after year in the future. Our low costs permit low prices, and every day moreAmericans discover that the Gecko is doing them a favor when he urges them to visit GEICO.com for a quote.(Our lizard has another endearing quality: Unlike human spokesmen or spokeswomen who expensively representother insurance companies, our little fellow has no agent.)\n************\nIn addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies, most of\nthem plying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. In aggregate, their results have consistently beenprofitable and the float they provide us is substantial. Charlie and I treasure these companies and their managers.\n9\n\nAt yearend, we acquired Princeton Insurance, a New Jersey writer of medical malpractice policies. This\nbolt-on transaction expands the managerial domain of Tim Kenesey, the star CEO of Medical Protective, our\nIndiana-based med-mal insurer. Princeton brings with it more than $600 million of float, an amount that isincluded in the following table.\nHere is the record of all four segments of our property-casualty and life insurance businesses:\nUnderwriting Profit\nYearend Float\n(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2011 2010 2011 2010\nBH Reinsurance ................ $(714) $ 176 $33,728 $30,370\nGeneral Re .................... 1 4 4 4 5 2 19,714 20,049\nGEICO ....................... 5 7 6 1,117 11,169 10,272\nOther Primary .................. 2 4 2 2 6 8 5,960 5,141\n$ 248 $2,013 $70,571 $65,832\nAmong large insurance operations, Berkshire’s impresses me as the best in the world.\nRegulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\nWe have two very large businesses, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, that have important common\ncharacteristics distinguishing them from our many other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own sectorin this letter and also split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.\nA key characteristic of both companies is the huge investment they have in very long-lived, regulated\nassets, with these partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our\ncredit is not needed: Both businesses have earning power that even under terrible business conditions amplycovers their interest requirements. In a less than robust economy during 2011, for example, BNSF’s interestcoverage was 9.5x. At MidAmerican, meanwhile, two key factors ensure its ability to service debt under allcircumstances: The stability of earnings that is inherent in our exclusively offering an essential service and adiversity of earnings streams, which shield it from the actions of any single regulatory body.\nMeasured by ton-miles, rail moves 42% of America’s inter-city freight, and BNSF moves more than\nany other railroad – about 37% of the industry total. A little math will tell you that about 15% of allinter-city\nton-miles of freight in the U.S. is transported by BNSF. It is no exaggeration to characterize railroads as thecirculatory system of our economy. Your railroad is the largest artery.\nAll of this places a huge responsibility on us. We must, without fail, maintain and improve our 23,000\nmiles of track along with 13,000 bridges, 80 tunnels, 6,900 locomotives and 78,600 freight cars. This job requiresus to have ample financial resources under alleconomic scenarios and to have the human talent that can instantly\nand effectively deal with the vicissitudes of nature, such as the widespread flooding BNSF labored under lastsummer.\nTo fulfill its societal obligation, BNSF regularly invests far more than its depreciation charge, with the\nexcess amounting to $1.8 billion in 2011. The three other major U.S. railroads are making similar outlays.Though many people decry our country’s inadequate infrastructure spending, that criticism cannot be leviedagainst the railroad industry. It is pouring money – funds from the private sector – into the investment projects\nneeded to provide better and more extensive service in the future. If railroads were not making these hugeexpenditures, our country’s publicly-financed highway system would face even greater congestion andmaintenance problems than exist today.\nMassive investments of the sort that BNSF is making would be foolish if it could not earn appropriate\nreturns on the incremental sums it commits. But I am confident it will do so because of the value it delivers.Many years ago Ben Franklin counseled, “Keep thy shop, and thy shop will keep thee.” Translating this to ourregulated businesses, he might today say, “Take care of your customer, and the regulator – your customer’srepresentative – will take care of you.” Good behavior by each party begets good behavior in return.\n10\n\nAt MidAmerican, we participate in a similar “social compact.” We are expected to put up ever-increasing\nsums to satisfy the future needs of our customers. If we meanwhile operate reliably and efficiently,we know that we will obtain a fair return on these investments.\nMidAmerican, 89.8% owned by Berkshire, supplies 2.5 million customers in the U.S. with electricity,\noperating as the largest supplier in Iowa, Utah and Wyoming and as an important provider in six other states aswell. Our pipelines transport 8% of the country’s natural gas. Obviously, many millions of Americans depend onus every day. They haven’t been disappointed.\nWhen MidAmerican purchased Northern Natural Gas pipeline in 2002, that company’s performance as\na pipeline was rated dead last, 43 out of 43, by the leading authority in the field. In the most recent report,Northern Natural was ranked second. The top spot was held by our other pipeline, Kern River.\nIn its electric business, MidAmerican has a comparable record. In the most recent survey of customer\nsatisfaction, MidAmerican’s U.S. utilities ranked second among 60 utility groups surveyed. The story was fardifferent not many years back when MidAmerican acquired these properties.\nMidAmerican will have 3,316 megawatts of wind generation in operation by the end of 2012, far more\nthan any other regulated electric utility in the country. The total amount that we have invested or committed towind is a staggering $6 billion. We can make this sort of investment because MidAmerican retains allof its\nearnings, unlike other utilities that generally pay out most of what they earn. In addition, late last year we took ontwo solar projects – one 100%-owned in California and the other 49%-owned in Arizona – that will cost about $3billion to construct. Many more wind and solar projects will almost certainly follow.\nAs you can tell by now, I am proud of what has been accomplished for our society by Matt Rose at\nBNSF and by Greg Abel at MidAmerican. I am also both proud and grateful for what they have accomplished forBerkshire shareholders. Below are the relevant figures:\nMidAmerican\nEarnings (in millions)\n2011 2010\nU.K. utilities ............................................................. $ 4 6 9 $ 3 3 3\nIowa utility .............................................................. 2 7 9 2 7 9\nWestern utilities .......................................................... 7 7 1 7 8 3\nPipelines ................................................................ 3 8 8 3 7 8\nHomeServices ............................................................ 3 9 4 2\nOther (net) ............................................................... 3 6 4 7\nOperating earnings before corporate interest and taxes ............................ 1,982 1,862\nInterest, other than to Berkshire ..............................................

In each instance, however, Charlie and I believe current intrinsic value is fargreater than book value.\n11\n\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations\nOur activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront. Let’s look, though, at a summary balance\nsheet and earnings statement for the entire group.\nBalance Sheet 12/31/11 (in millions)\nAssets Liabilities and Equity\nCash and equivalents ................... $ 4,241 Notes payable .................... $ 1,611\nAccounts and notes receivable ........... 6,584 Other current liabilities ............. 15,124\nInventory ............................ 8,975 Total current liabilities ............. 16,735\nOther current assets .................... 6 3 1\nTotal current assets .................... 20,431\nDeferred taxes .................... 4,661\nGoodwill and other intangibles ........... 24,755 Term debt and other liabilities ....... 6,214\nFixed assets .......................... 17,866 Non-controlling interests ............ 2,410\nOther assets .......................... 3,661 Berkshire equity .................. 36,693\n$66,713 $66,713\nEarnings Statement (in millions)\n2011** 2010 2009\nRevenues ................................................... $72,406 $66,610 $61,665\nOperating expenses (including depreciation of $1,431 in 2011,\n$1,362 in 2010 and $1,422 in 2009) ............................ 67,239 62,225 59,509\nInterest expense .............................................. 1 3 0 1 1 1 9 8\nPre-tax earnings .............................................. 5,037* 4,274* 2,058*\nIncome taxes and non-controlling interests ........................ 1,998 1,812 945\nNet earnings ................................................ $ 3,039 $ 2,462 $ 1,113\n*Does not include purchase-accounting adjustments.\n**Includes earnings of Lubrizol from September 16.\nThis group of companies sells products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of the businesses\nenjoy terrific economics, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets that run from 25% after-tax to\nmore than 100%. Others produce good returns in the area of 12-20%. A few, however, have very poor returns, a\nresult of some serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation. These errors came about because I misjudgedeither the competitive strength of the business being purchased or the future economics of the industry in which itoperated. I try to look out ten or twenty years when making an acquisition, but sometimes my eyesight has beenpoor. Charlie’s has been better; he voted no more than “present” on several of my errant purchases.\nBerkshire’s newer shareholders may be puzzled over our decision to hold on to my mistakes. After all,\ntheir earnings can never be consequential to Berkshire’s valuation, and problem companies require moremanagerial time than winners. Any management consultant or Wall Street advisor would look at our laggards andsay “dump them.”\nThat won’t happen. For 29 years, we have regularly laid out Berkshire’s economic principles in these\nreports (pages 93-98) and Number 11 describes our general reluctance to sell poor performers (which, in mostcases, lag because of industry factors rather than managerial shortcomings). Our approach is far from Darwinian,and many of you may disapprove of it. I can understand your position. However, we have made – and continue tomake – a commitment to the sellers of businesses we buy that we will retain those businesses through thick andthin. So far, the dollar cost of that commitment has not been substantial and may well be offset by the goodwill itbuilds among prospective sellers looking for the right permanent home for their treasured business and loyalassociates. These owners know that what they get with us can’t be delivered by others and that our commitmentswill be good for many decades to come.\n12\n\nPlease understand, however, that Charlie and I are neither masochists nor Pollyannas. If either of the\nfailings we set forth in Rule 11 is present – if the business will likely be a cash drain over the longer term, or if laborstrife is endemic – we will take prompt and decisive action. Such a situation has happened only a couple of times inour 47-year history, and none of the businesses we now own is in straits requiring us to consider disposing of it.\n************\nThe steady and substantial comeback in the U.S. economy since mid-2009 is clear from the earnings\nshown at the front of this section. This compilation includes 54 of our companies. But one of these, Marmon, isitself the owner of 140 operations in eleven distinct business sectors. In short, when you look at Berkshire, youare looking across corporate America. So let’s dig a little deeper to gain a greater insight into what has happenedin the last few years.\nThe four housing-related companies in this section (a group that excludes Clayton, which is carried\nunder Finance and Financial Products) had aggregate pre-tax earnings of $227 million in 2009, $362 million in2010 and $359 million in 2011. If you subtract these earnings from those in the combined statement, you will seethat our multiple and diverse non-housing operations earned $1,831 million in 2009, $3,912 million in 2010 and\n$4,678 million in 2011. About $291 million of the 2011 earnings came from the Lubrizol acquisition. The profileof the remaining 2011 earnings – $4,387 million – illustrates the comeback of much of America from thedevastation wrought by the 2008 financial panic. Though housing-related businesses remain in the emergencyroom, most other businesses have left the hospital with their health fully restored.\n************\nAlmost all of our managers delivered outstanding performances last year, among them those managers\nwho run housing-related businesses and were therefore fighting hurricane-force headwinds. Here are a few examples:\n• Vic Mancinelli again set a record at CTB, our agricultural equipment operation. We purchased CTB in\n2002 for $139 million. It has subsequently distributed $180 million to Berkshire, last year earned $124million pre-tax and has $109 million in cash. Vic has made a number of bolt-on acquisitions over theyears, including a meaningful one he signed up after yearend.\n• TTI, our electric components distributor, increased its sales to a record $2.1 billion, up 12.4% from\n2010. Earnings also hit a record, up 127% from 2007, the year in which we purchased the business. In2011, TTI performed far better than the large publicly-traded companies in its field. That’s no surprise:Paul Andrews and his associates have been besting them for years. Charlie and I are delighted that Paulnegotiated a large bolt-on acquisition early in 2012. We hope more follow.\n• Iscar, our 80%-owned cutting-tools operation, continues to amaze us. Its sales growth and overall\nperformance are unique in its industry. Iscar’s managers – Eitan Wertheimer, Jacob Harpaz and DannyGoldman – are brilliant strategists and operators. When the economic world was cratering in November2008, they stepped up to buy Tungaloy, a leading Japanese cutting-tool manufacturer. Tungaloysuffered significant damage when the tsunami hit north of Tokyo last spring. But you wouldn’t knowthat now: Tungaloy went on to set a sales record in 2011. I visited the Iwaki plant in November andwas inspired by the dedication and enthusiasm of Tungaloy’s management, as well as its staff. They area wonderful group and deserve your admiration and thanks.\n• McLane, our huge distribution company that is run by Grady Rosier, added important new customers in\n2011 and set a pre-tax earnings record of $370 million. Since its purchase in 2003 for $1.5 billion, thecompany has had pre-tax earnings of $2.4 billion and also increased its LIFO reserve by $230 millionbecause the prices of the retail products it distributes (candy, gum, cigarettes, etc.) have risen. Gradyruns a logistical machine second to none. You can look for bolt-ons at McLane, particularly in our newwine-and-spirits distribution business.\n13\n\n• Jordan Hansell took over at NetJets in April and delivered 2011 pre-tax earnings of $227 million. That\nis a particularly impressive performance because the sale of new planes was slow during most of theyear. In December, however, there was an uptick that was more than seasonally normal. Howpermanent it will be is uncertain.\nA few years ago NetJets was my number one worry: Its costs were far out of line with revenues, and\ncash was hemorrhaging. Without Berkshire’s support, NetJets would have gone broke. These problemsare behind us, and Jordan is now delivering steady profits from a well-controlled and smoothly-runningoperation. NetJets is proceeding on a plan to enter China with some first-class partners, a move thatwill widen our business “moat.” No other fractional-ownership operator has remotely the size andbreadth of the NetJets operation, and none ever will. NetJets’ unrelenting focus on safety and servicehas paid off in the marketplace.\n• It’s a joy to watch Marmon’s progress under Frank Ptak’s leadership. In addition to achieving internal\ngrowth, Frank regularly makes bolt-on acquisitions that, in aggregate, will materially increase Marmon’searning power. (He did three, costing about $270 million, in the last few months.) Joint ventures aroundthe world are another opportunity for Marmon. At midyear Marmon partnered with the Kundalia familyin an Indian crane operation that is already delivering substantial profits. This is Marmon’s secondventure with the family, following a successful wire and cable partnership instituted a few years ago.\nOf the eleven major sectors in which Marmon operates, ten delivered gains in earnings last year. You\ncan be confident of higher earnings from Marmon in the years ahead.\n• “Buy commodities, sell brands” has long been a formula for business success. It has produced\nenormous and sustained profits for Coca-Cola since 1886 and Wrigley since 1891. On a smaller scale,we have enjoyed good fortune with this approach at See’s Candy since we purchased it 40 years ago.\nLast year See’s had record pre-tax earnings of $83 million, bringing its total since we bought it to $1.65\nbillion. Contrast that figure with our purchase price of $25 million and our yearend carrying-value (netof cash) of less than zero. (Yes, you read that right; capital employed at See’s fluctuates seasonally,hitting a low after Christmas.) Credit Brad Kinstler for taking the company to new heights since hebecame CEO in 2006.\n• Nebraska Furniture Mart (80% owned) set an earnings record in 2011, netting more than ten times what\nit did in 1983, when we acquired our stake.\nBut that’s not the big news. More important was NFM’s acquisition of a 433-acre tract north of Dallas\non which we will build what is almost certain to be the highest-volume home-furnishings store in thecountry. Currently, that title is shared by our two stores in Omaha and Kansas City, each of which hadrecord-setting sales of more than $400 million in 2011. It will be several years before the Texas store iscompleted, but I look forward to cutting the ribbon at the opening. (At Berkshire, the managers do thework; I take the bows.)\nOur new store, which will offer an unequalled variety of merchandise sold at prices that can’t be\nmatched, will bring huge crowds from near and far. This drawing power and our extensive holdings ofland at the site should enable us to attract a number of other major stores. (If any high-volume retailersare reading this, contact me.)\nOur experience with NFM and the Blumkin family that runs it has been a real joy. The business was\nbuilt by Rose Blumkin (known to all as “Mrs. B”), who started the company in 1937 with $500 and adream. She sold me our interest when she was 89 and worked until she was 103. (After retiring, shedied the next year, a sequence I point out to any other Berkshire manager who even thinks of retiring.)\nMrs. B’s son, Louie, now 92, helped his mother build the business after he returned from World War II\nand, along with his wife, Fran, has been my friend for 55 years. In turn, Louie’s sons, Ron and Irv, havetaken the company to new heights, first opening the Kansas City store and now gearing up for Texas.\n14\n\nThe “boys” and I have had many great times together, and I count them among my best friends. The\nBlumkins are a remarkable family. Never inclined to let an extraordinary gene pool go to waste, I amrejoicing these days because several members of the fourth Blumkin generation have joined NFM.\nOverall, the intrinsic value of the businesses in this Berkshire sector significantly exceeds their book\nvalue. For many of the smaller companies, however, this is not true. I have made more than my share of mistakesbuying small companies. Charlie long ago told me, “If something’s not worth doing at all, it’s not worthdoing well,” and I should have listened harder. In any event, our large purchases have generally workedwell – extraordinarily well in a few cases – and overall this sector is a winner for us.\n************\nCertain shareholders have told me they hunger for more discussions of accounting arcana. So here’s a\nbit of GAAP-mandated nonsense I hope both of them enjoy.\nCommon sense would tell you that our varied subsidiaries should be carried on our books at their cost\nplus the earnings they have retained since our purchase (unless their economic value has materially decreased, inwhich case an appropriate write-down must be taken). And that’s essentially the reality at Berkshire – except forthe weird situation at Marmon.\nWe purchased 64% of the company in 2008 and put this interest on our books at our cost, $4.8 billion.\nSo far, so good. Then, in early 2011, pursuant to our original contract with the Pritzker family, we purchased anadditional 16%, paying $1.5 billion as called for by a formula that reflected Marmon’s increased value. In thisinstance, however, we were required to immediately write off $614 million of the purchase price retroactive tothe end of 2010. (Don’t ask!) Obviously, this write-off had no connection to economic reality. The excess ofMarmon’s intrinsic value over its carrying value is widened by this meaningless write-down.\nFinance and Financial Products\nThis sector, our smallest, includes two rental companies, XTRA (trailers) and CORT (furniture), and\nClayton Homes, the country’s leading producer and financer of manufactured homes. Aside from these 100%-ownedsubsidiaries, we also include in this category a collection of financial assets and our 50% interest in BerkadiaCommercial Mortgage.\nIt’s instructive to look at what transpired at our three operating businesses after the economy fell off a\ncliff in late 2008, because their experiences illuminate the fractured recovery that later came along.\nResults at our two leasing companies mirrored the “non-housing” economy. Their combined pre-tax\nearnings were $13 million in 2009, $53 million in 2010 and $155 million in 2011, an improvement reflecting thesteady recovery we have seen in almost all of our non-housing businesses. In contrast, Clayton’s world ofmanufactured housing (just like site-built housing) has endured a veritable depression, experiencing no recoveryto date. Manufactured housing sales in the nation were 49,789 homes in 2009, 50,046 in 2010 and 51,606 in2011. (When housing was booming in 2005, they were 146,744.)\nDespite these difficult times, Clayton has continued to operate profitably, largely because its mortgage\nportfolio has performed well under trying circumstances. Because we are the largest lender in the manufacturedhomes sector and are also normally lending to lower-and-middle-income families, you might expect us to sufferheavy losses during a housing meltdown. But by sticking to old-fashioned loan policies – meaningful downpayments and monthly payments with a sensible relationship to regular income – Clayton has kept losses toacceptable levels. It has done so even though many of our borrowers have had negative equity for some time.\nAs is well-known, the U.S. went off the rails in its home-ownership and mortgage-lending policies,\nand for these mistakes our economy is now paying a huge price. All of us participated in the destructivebehavior – government, lenders, borrowers, the media, rating agencies, you name it. At the core of the folly wasthe almost universal belief that the value of houses was certain to increase over time and that any dipswould be inconsequential. The acceptance of this premise justified almost any price and practice in housingtransactions. Homeowners everywhere felt richer and rushed to “monetize” the increased value of their homes byrefinancings. These massive cash infusions fueled a consumption binge throughout our economy. It all seemedgreat fun while it lasted. (A largely unnoted fact: Large numbers of people who have “lost” their house throughforeclosure have actually realized a profit because they carried out refinancings earlier that gave them cash inexcess of their cost. In these cases, the evicted homeowner was the winner, and the victim was the lender.)\n15\n\nIn 2007, the bubble burst, just as all bubbles must. We are now in the fourth year of a cure that, though\nlong and painful, is sure to succeed. Today, household formations are consistently exceeding housing starts.\nClayton’s earnings should improve materially when the nation’s excess housing inventory is worked\noff. As I see things today, however, I believe the intrinsic value of the three businesses in this sector does notdiffer materially from their book value.\nInvestments\nBelow we show our common stock investments that at yearend had a market value of more than $1 billion.\n12/31/11\nShares CompanyPercentage of\nCompany\nOwnedCost* Market\n(in millions)\n151,610,700 American Express Company ............. 13.0 $ 1,287 $ 7,151\n200,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company ................ 8 . 8 1,299 13,994\n29,100,937 ConocoPhillips ........................ 2 . 3 2,027 2,121\n63,905,931 International Business Machines Corp. ..... 5 . 5 10,856 11,751\n31,416,127 Johnson & Johnson ..................... 1 . 2 1,880 2,060\n79,034,713 Kraft Foods Inc. ....................... 4 . 5 2,589 2,953\n20,060,390 Munich Re ........................... 11.3 2,990 2,464\n3,947,555 POSCO .............................. 5 . 1 7 6 8 1,301\n72,391,036 The Procter & Gamble Company .......... 2 . 6 4 6 4 4,829\n25,848,838 Sanofi ............................... 1 . 9 2,055 1,900\n291,577,428 Tesco plc ............................. 3 . 6 1,719 1,827\n78,060,769 U.S. Bancorp ......................... 4 . 1 2,401 2,112\n39,037,142 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ................... 1 . 1 1,893 2,333\n400,015,828 Wells Fargo & Company ................ 7 . 6 9,086 11,024\nOthers ............................... 6,895 9,171\nTotal Common Stocks Carried at Market .... $48,209 $76,991\n*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP “cost” differs in a few cases because of\nwrite-ups or write-downs that have been required.\nWe made few changes in our investment holdings during 2011. But three moves were important: our\npurchases of IBM and Bank of America and the $1 billion addition we made to our Wells Fargo position.\nThe banking industry is back on its feet, and Wells Fargo is prospering. Its earnings are strong, its\nassets solid and its capital at record levels. At Bank of America, some huge mistakes were made by priormanagement. Brian Moynihan has made excellent progress in cleaning these up, though the completion of thatprocess will take a number of years. Concurrently, he is nurturing a huge and attractive underlying business thatwill endure long after today’s problems are forgotten. Our warrants to buy 700 million Bank of America shareswill likely be of great value before they expire.\nAs was the case with Coca-Cola in 1988 and the railroads in 2006, I was late to the IBM party. I have\nbeen reading the company’s annual report for more than 50 years, but it wasn’t until a Saturday in March lastyear that my thinking crystallized. As Thoreau said, “It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.”\nTodd Combs built a $1.75 billion portfolio (at cost) last year, and Ted Weschler will soon create one of\nsimilar size. Each of them receives 80% of his performance compensation from his own results and 20% from hispartner’s. When our quarterly filings report relatively small holdings, these are not likely to be buys I made(though the media often overlook that point) but rather holdings denoting purchases by Todd or Ted.\n16\n\nOne additional point about these two new arrivals. Both Ted and Todd will be helpful to the next CEO\nof Berkshire in making acquisitions. They have excellent “business minds” that grasp the economic forces likelyto determine the future of a wide variety of businesses. They are aided in their thinking by an understanding ofwhat is predictable and what is unknowable.\n************\nThere is little new to report on our derivatives positions, which we have described in detail in past reports.\n(Annual reports since 1977 are available at www.berkshirehathaway.com.) One important industry change,however, must be noted: Though our existing contracts have very minor collateral requirements, the rules havechanged for new positions. Consequently, we will not be initiating any major derivatives positions. We shuncontracts of any type that could require the instant posting of collateral. The possibility of some sudden and hugeposting requirement – arising from an out-of-the-blue event such as a worldwide financial panic or massive terroristattack – is inconsistent with our primary objectives of redundant liquidity and unquestioned financial strength.\nOur insurance-like derivatives contracts, whereby we pay if various issues included in high-yield bond\nindices default, are coming to a close. The contracts that most exposed us to losses have already expired, and theremainder will terminate soon. In 2011, we paid out $86 million on two losses, bringing our total payments to$2.6 billion. We are almost certain to realize a final “underwriting profit” on this portfolio because the premiumswe received were $3.4 billion, and our future losses are apt to be minor. In addition, we will have averaged about$2 billion of float over the five-year life of these contracts. This successful result during a time of great creditstress underscores the importance of obtaining a premium that is commensurate with the risk.\nCharlie and I continue to believe that our equity-put positions will produce a significant profit, considering\nboth the $4.2 billion of float we will have held for more than fifteen years and the $222 million profit we’ve alreadyrealized on contracts that we repurchased. At yearend, Berkshire’s book value reflected a liability of $8.5 billion forthe remaining contracts; if they had all come due at that time our payment would have been $6.2 billion.\nThe Basic Choices for Investors and the One We Strongly Prefer\nInvesting is often described as the process of laying out money now in the expectation of receiving\nmore money in the future. At Berkshire we take a more demanding approach, defining investing as the transfer toothers of purchasing power now with the reasoned expectation of receiving more purchasing power – after taxes\nhave been paid on nominal gains – in the future. More succinctly, investing is forgoing consumption now in\norder to have the ability to consume more at a later date.\nFrom our definition there flows an important corollary: The riskiness of an investment is notmeasured\nby beta (a Wall Street term encompassing volatility and often used in measuring risk) but rather by theprobability – the reasoned probability – of that investment causing its owner a loss of purchasing-power over his\ncontemplated holding period. Assets can fluctuate greatly in price and not be risky as long as they are reasonablycertain to deliver increased purchasing power over their holding period. And as we will see, a non-fluctuatingasset can be laden with risk.\nInvestment possibilities are both many and varied. There are three major categories, however, and it’s\nimportant to understand the characteristics of each. So let’s survey the field.\n• Investments that are denominated in a given currency include money-market funds, bonds, mortgages,\nbank deposits, and other instruments. Most of these currency-based investments are thought of as “safe.”In truth they are among the most dangerous of assets. Their beta may be zero, but their risk is huge.\nOver the past century these instruments have destroyed the purchasing power of investors in many\ncountries, even as the holders continued to receive timely payments of interest and principal. This uglyresult, moreover, will forever recur. Governments determine the ultimate value of money, and systemicforces will sometimes cause them to gravitate to policies that produce inflation. From time to time suchpolicies spin out of control.\nEven in the U.S., where the wish for a stable currency is strong, the dollar has fallen a staggering 86%\nin value since 1965, when I took over management of Berkshire. It takes no less than $7 today to buywhat $1 did at that time. Consequently, a tax-free institution would have needed 4.3% interest annuallyfrom bond investments over that period to simply maintain its purchasing power. Its managers wouldhave been kidding themselves if they thought of anyportion of that interest as “income.”\n17\n\nFor tax-paying investors like you and me, the picture has been far worse. During the same 47-year\nperiod, continuous rolling of U.S. Treasury bills produced 5.7% annually. That sounds satisfactory. Butif an individual investor paid personal income taxes at a rate averaging 25%, this 5.7% return wouldhave yielded nothing in the way of real income. This investor’s visible income tax would have stripped\nhim of 1.4 points of the stated yield, and the invisible inflation tax would have devoured the remaining4.3 points. It’s noteworthy that the implicit inflation “tax” was more than triple the explicit income taxthat our investor probably thought of as his main burden. “In God We Trust” may be imprinted on ourcurrency, but the hand that activates our government’s printing press has been all too human.\nHigh interest rates, of course, can compensate purchasers for the inflation risk they face with currency-based\ninvestments – and indeed, rates in the early 1980s did that job nicely. Current rates, however, do not comeclose to offsetting the purchasing-power risk that investors assume. Right now bonds should come with awarning label.\nUnder today’s conditions, therefore, I do not like currency-based investments. Even so, Berkshire holds\nsignificant amounts of them, primarily of the short-term variety. At Berkshire the need for ampleliquidity occupies center stage and will never be slighted, however inadequate rates may be.\nAccommodating this need, we primarily hold U.S. Treasury bills, the only investment that can becounted on for liquidity under the most chaotic of economic conditions. Our working level for liquidityis $20 billion; $10 billion is our absolute minimum.\nBeyond the requirements that liquidity and regulators impose on us, we will purchase currency-related\nsecurities only if they offer the possibility of unusual gain – either because a particular credit ismispriced, as can occur in periodic junk-bond debacles, or because rates rise to a level that offers thepossibility of realizing substantial capital gains on high-grade bonds when rates fall. Though we’veexploited both opportunities in the past – and may do so again – we are now 180 degrees removed fromsuch prospects. Today, a wry comment that Wall Streeter Shelby Cullom Davis made long ago seemsapt: “Bonds promoted as offering risk-free returns are now priced to deliver return-free risk.”\n• The second major category of investments involves assets that will never produce anything, but that are\npurchased in the buyer’s hope that someone else – who also knows that the assets will be foreverunproductive – will pay more for them in the future. Tulips, of all things, briefly became a favorite ofsuch buyers in the 17\nthcentury.\nThis type of investment requires an expanding pool of buyers, who, in turn, are enticed because they\nbelieve the buying pool will expand still further. Owners are notinspired by what the asset itself can\nproduce – it will remain lifeless forever – but rather by the belief that others will desire it even moreavidly in the future.\nThe major asset in this category is gold, currently a huge favorite of investors who fear almost all other\nassets, especially paper money (of whose value, as noted, they are right to be fearful). Gold, however,has two significant shortcomings, being neither of much use nor procreative. True, gold has someindustrial and decorative utility, but the demand for these purposes is both limited and incapable ofsoaking up new production. Meanwhile, if you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will stillown one ounce at its end.\nWhat motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow. During the\npast decade that belief has proved correct. Beyond that, the rising price has on its own generatedadditional buying enthusiasm, attracting purchasers who see the rise as validating an investment thesis.As “bandwagon” investors join any party, they create their own truth – for a while .\nOver the past 15 years, both Internet stocks and houses have demonstrated the extraordinary excesses\nthat can be created by combining an initially sensible thesis with well-publicized rising prices. In thesebubbles, an army of originally skeptical investors succumbed to the “proof” delivered by the market,and the pool of buyers – for a time – expanded sufficiently to keep the bandwagon rolling. But bubblesblown large enough inevitably pop. And then the old proverb is confirmed once again: “What the wiseman does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.”\n18\n\nToday the world’s gold stock is about 170,000 metric tons. If all of this gold were melded together, it\nwould form a cube of about 68 feet per side. (Picture it fitting comfortably within a baseball infield.) At$1,750 per ounce – gold’s price as I write this – its value would be $9.6 trillion. Call this cube pile A.\nLet’s now create a pile B costing an equal amount. For that, we could buy allU.S. cropland (400\nmillion acres with output of about $200 billion annually), plus 16 Exxon Mobils (the world’s mostprofitable company, one earning more than $40 billion annually). After these purchases, we wouldhave about $1 trillion left over for walking-around money (no sense feeling strapped after this buyingbinge). Can you imagine an investor with $9.6 trillion selecting pile A over pile B?\nBeyond the staggering valuation given the existing stock of gold, current prices make today’s annual\nproduction of gold command about $160 billion. Buyers – whether jewelry and industrial users,frightened individuals, or speculators – must continually absorb this additional supply to merelymaintain an equilibrium at present prices.\nA century from now the 400 million acres of farmland will have produced staggering amounts of corn,\nwheat, cotton, and other crops – and will continue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever thecurrency may be. Exxon Mobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to itsowners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, you get 16Exxons). The\n170,000 tons of gold will be unchanged in size and still incapable of producing anything. You canfondle the cube, but it will not respond.\nAdmittedly, when people a century from now are fearful, it’s likely many will still rush to gold. I’m\nconfident, however, that the $9.6 trillion current valuation of pile A will compound over the century ata rate far inferior to that achieved by pile B.\n• Our first two categories enjoy maximum popularity at peaks of fear: Terror over economic collapse\ndrives individuals to currency-based assets, most particularly U.S. obligations, and fear of currencycollapse fosters movement to sterile assets such as gold. We heard “cash is king” in late 2008, justwhen cash should have been deployed rather than held. Similarly, we heard “cash is trash” in the early1980s just when fixed-dollar investments were at their most attractive level in memory. On thoseoccasions, investors who required a supportive crowd paid dearly for that comfort.\nMy own preference – and you knew this was coming – is our third category: investment in productive\nassets, whether businesses, farms, or real estate. Ideally, these assets should have the ability ininflationary times to deliver output that will retain its purchasing-power value while requiring aminimum of new capital investment. Farms, real estate, and many businesses such as Coca-Cola, IBMand our own See’s Candy meet that double-barreled test. Certain other companies – think of ourregulated utilities, for example – fail it because inflation places heavy capital requirements on them. Toearn more, their owners must invest more. Even so, these investments will remain superior tononproductive or currency-based assets.\nWhether the currency a century from now is based on gold, seashells, shark teeth, or a piece of paper\n(as today), people will be willing to exchange a couple of minutes of their daily labor for a Coca-Colaor some See’s peanut brittle. In the future the U.S. population will move more goods, consume morefood, and require more living space than it does now. People will forever exchange what they producefor what others produce.\nOur country’s businesses will continue to efficiently deliver goods and services wanted by our citizens.\nMetaphorically, these commercial “cows” will live for centuries and give ever greater quantities of “milk”to boot. Their value will be determined not by the medium of exchange but rather by their capacity todeliver milk. Proceeds from the sale of the milk will compound for the owners of the cows, just as theydid during the 20\nthcentury when the Dow increased from 66 to 11,497 (and paid loads of dividends as\nwell). Berkshire’s goal will be to increase its ownership of first-class businesses. Our first choice will beto own them in their entirety – but we will also be owners by way of holding sizable amounts ofmarketable stocks. I believe that over any extended period of time this category of investing will prove tobe the runaway winner among the three we’ve examined. More important, it will be by far the safest.\n19\n\nThe Annual Meeting\nThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 5that the CenturyLink Center (renamed from\n“Qwest”). Last year, Carrie Kizer debuted as the ringmaster and earned a lifetime assignment. Everyone lovedthe job she did – especially me.\nSoon after the 7 a.m. opening of the doors, we will have a new activity: The Newspaper Tossing Challenge.\nLate last year, Berkshire purchased the Omaha World-Herald and, in my meeting with its shareholder-employees,I told of the folding and throwing skills I developed while delivering 500,000 papers as a teenager.\nI immediately saw skepticism in the eyes of the audience. That was no surprise to me. After all, the\nreporters’ mantra is: “If your mother says she loves you, check it out.” So now I have to back up my claim. Atthe meeting, I will take on all comers in making 35-foot tosses of the World-Herald to a Clayton porch. Anychallenger whose paper lands closer to the doorstep than mine will receive a dilly bar. I’ve asked Dairy Queen tosupply several for the contest, though I doubt that any will be needed. We will have a large stack of papers. Grabone. Fold it (no rubber bands). Take your best shot. Make my day.\nAt 8:30, a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answer\nperiod, which (with a break for lunch at the CenturyLink’s stands) will last until 3:30. After a short recess,Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decide to leave during the day’s question periods,please do so while Charlie is talking.\nThe best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We will help you do so by filling the 194,300-square-foot\nhall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you did yourpart, and most locations racked up record sales. In a nine-hour period, we sold 1,249 pairs of Justin boots, 11,254pounds of See’s candy, 8,000 Quikut knives (that’s 15 knives per minute) and 6,126 pairs of Wells Lamontgloves, a Marmon product whose very existence was news to me. (The product I focus on is money.) But you cando better. Remember: Anyone who says money can’t buy happiness simply hasn’t shopped at our meeting.\nAmong the new exhibitors this year will be Brooks, our running-shoe company. Brooks has been\ngobbling up market share and in 2011 had a sales gain of 34%, its tenth consecutive year of record volume. Dropby and congratulate Jim Weber, the company’s CEO. And be sure to buy a couple of pairs of limited edition“Berkshire Hathaway Running Shoes.”\nGEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of\nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you ashareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which weoperate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that givencertain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. Forat least half of you, I believe we can.\nBe sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry more than 35 books and DVDs, including a couple of new\nones. I recommend MiTek , an informative history of one of our very successful subsidiaries. You’ll learn how my\ninterest in the company was originally piqued by my receiving in the mail a hunk of ugly metal whose purpose Icouldn’t fathom. Since we bought MiTek in 2001, it has made 33 “tuck-in” acquisitions, almost all successful. Ithink you’ll also like a short book that Peter Bevelin has put together explaining Berkshire’s investment andoperating principles. It sums up what Charlie and I have been saying over the years in annual reports and atannual meetings. Should you need to ship your book purchases, a shipping service will be available nearby.\nIf you are a big spender – or aspire to become one – visit Elliott Aviation on the east side of the Omaha\nairport between noon and 5:00 p.m. on Saturday. There we will have a fleet of NetJets aircraft that will get yourpulse racing. Come by bus; leave by private jet. I’ll OK your credit.\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. Airlines have sometimes jacked up pricesfor the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City versusOmaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2\n1⁄2hours, and it may be that you can save significant money,\nparticularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. Spend the savings with us.\n20\n\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72ndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we\nwill again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. Last year the store did $32.7 million of businessduring its annual meeting sale, a volume that exceeds the yearly sales of most furniture stores. To obtain theBerkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, May 1\nstand Monday, May 7thinclusive,\nand also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even apply to the products of severalprestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit ofour shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. NFM is openfrom10a.m.to9p.m.MondaythroughSaturday,and10a.m.to6p.m.onSunday.OnSaturdaythisyear,from5:30p.m.to 8 p.m., NFM is having a picnic to which you are all invited.\nAt Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception\nfrom 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 4\nth. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 6th, from\n9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. On Sunday, around 2 p.m., I will be clerking atBorsheims, desperate to beat my sales figure from last year. So come take advantage of me. Ask me for my“Crazy Warren” price.\nWe will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 30\nththrough Saturday, May 12th. During that period,\nplease identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement thatshows you are a Berkshire holder.\nOn Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion,\nwill take on all comers – who will have their eyes wide open – in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, aremarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and SharonOsberg, two of the world’s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sundayafternoon. Two non-experts – Charlie and I – will also be at the tables.\nGorat’s and Piccolo’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 6\nth.\nBoth will be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat’s opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo’s opening at 4 p.m. Theserestaurants are my favorites, and I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening. (Actuarial tables tell me that I canconsume another 12 million calories before my death. I’m terrified at the thought of leaving any of these behind,so will be frontloading on Sunday.) Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call 402-551-3733 on April 1\nst\n(but not before ) and at Piccolo’s, call 402-342-9038. At Piccolo’s, show some class and order a giant root beer\nfloat for dessert. Only sissies get the small one.\nWe will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the\nmeeting, asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalistsand their e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be e-mailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com;Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com, and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times,at arsorkin@nytimes.com.\nFrom the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the dozen or so he or she decides are the\nmost interesting and important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selectedif you keep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more thantwo questions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your namementioned if your question is selected.)\nThis year we are adding a second panel of three financial analysts who follow Berkshire. They are Cliff\nGallant of KBW, Jay Gelb of Barclays Capital and Gary Ransom of Dowling and Partners. These analysts willbring their own Berkshire-specific questions and alternate with the journalists and the audience.\nCharlie and I believe that all shareholders should have access to new Berkshire information simultaneously\nand should also have adequate time to analyze it, which is why we try to issue financial information after the marketclose on a Friday. We do not talk one-on-one to large institutional investors or analysts. Our new panel will letanalysts ask questions – perhaps even a few technical ones – in a manner that may be helpful to many shareholders.\n21\n\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the\njournalists and analysts will come up with some tough ones, and that’s the way we like it. All told, we expect atleast 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and 18 from the audience. If there issome extra time, we will take more from the audience. Audience questioners will be determined by drawings thatwill take place at 8:15 a.m. at each of the 13 microphones located in the arena and main overflow room.\n************\nFor good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly\nAll-Stars, who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I believe their mindsetto be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most have nofinancial need to work; the joy of hitting business “home runs” means as much to them as their paycheck.\nEqually important, however, are the 23 men and women who work with me at our corporate office (all\non one floor, which is the way we intend to keep it!).\nThis group efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements and files a\n17,839-page Federal income tax return – hello, Guinness! – as well as state and foreign returns. Additionally,they respond to countless shareholder and media inquiries, get out the annual report, prepare for the country’slargest annual meeting, coordinate the Board’s activities – and the list goes on and on.\nThey handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy\nand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: They deal with 48 universities (selectedfrom 200 applicants) who will send students to Omaha this school year for a day with me and also handle all kindsof requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers for lunch. No CEO has it better.\nThis home office crew, along with our operating managers, has my deepest thanks and deserves yours\nas well. Come to Omaha – the cradle of capitalism – on May 5\nthand tell them so.\nFebruary 25, 2012 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board\n22",

Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold atmarket rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire’sresults through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculatedusing the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-\ntax. If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its\nresults would have lagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded theS&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused theaggregate lag to be substantial.\n2\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nIn 2012, Berkshire achieved a total gain for its shareholders of $24.1 billion. We used $1.3 billion of that\nto repurchase our stock, which left us with an increase in net worth of $22.8 billion for the year. The per-share book\nvalue of both our Class A and Class B stock increased by 14.4%. Over the last 48 years (that is, since presentmanagement took over), book value has grown from $19 to $114,214, a rate of 19.7% compounded annually.*\nA number of good things happened at Berkshire last year, but let’s first get the bad news out of the way.\nŠWhen the partnership I ran took control of Berkshire in 1965, I could never have dreamed that a year inwhich we had a gain of $24.1 billion would be subpar, in terms of the comparison we present on the facingpage.\nBut subpar it was. For the ninth time in 48 years, Berkshire’s percentage increase in book value was less\nthan the S&P’s percentage gain (a calculation that includes dividends as well as price appreciation). Ineight of those nine years, it should be noted, the S&P had a gain of 15% or more. We do better when thewind is in our face.\nTo date, we’ve never had a five-year period of underperformance, having managed 43 times to surpass the\nS&P over such a stretch. (The record is on page 103.) But the S&P has now had gains in each of the lastfour years, outpacing us over that period. If the market continues to advance in 2013, our streak of five-year wins will end.\nOne thing of which you can be certain: Whatever Berkshire’s results, my partner Charlie Munger, the\ncompany’s Vice Chairman, and I will not change yardsticks. It’s our jobto increase intrinsic business\nvalue – for which we use book value as a significantly understated proxy – at a faster rate than the market\ngains of the S&P. If we do so, Berkshire’s share price, though unpredictable from year to year, will itselfoutpace the S&P over time. If we fail, however, our management will bring no value to our investors, whothemselves can earn S&P returns by buying a low-cost index fund.\nCharlie and I believe the gain in Berkshire’s intrinsic value will over time likely surpass the S&P returns bya small margin. We’re confident of that because we have some outstanding businesses, a cadre of terrificoperating managers and a shareholder-oriented culture. Our relative performance, however, is almostcertain to be better when the market is down or flat. In years when the market is particularly strong, expectus to fall short.\nŠThe second disappointment in 2012 was my inability to make a major acquisition. I pursued a couple ofelephants, but came up empty-handed.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are\n1/1500thof those shown for A.\n3\n\nOur luck, however, changed early this year. In February, we agreed to buy 50% of a holding company that\nwill own all of H. J. Heinz. The other half will be owned by a small group of investors led by Jorge PauloLemann, a renowned Brazilian businessman and philanthropist.\nWe couldn’t be in better company. Jorge Paulo is a long-time friend of mine and an extraordinarymanager. His group and Berkshire will each contribute about $4 billion for common equity in the holdingcompany. Berkshire will also invest $8 billion in preferred shares that pay a 9% dividend. The preferredhas two other features that materially increase its value: at some point it will be redeemed at a significantpremium price and the preferred also comes with warrants permitting us to buy 5% of the holdingcompany’s common stock for a nominal sum.\nOur total investment of about $12 billion soaks up much of what Berkshire earned last year. But we stillhave plenty of cash and are generating more at a good clip. So it’s back to work; Charlie and I have againdonned our safari outfits and resumed our search for elephants.\nNow to some good news from 2012:\nŠLast year I told you that BNSF, Iscar, Lubrizol, Marmon Group and MidAmerican Energy – our five most\nprofitable non-insurance companies – were likely to earn more than $10 billion pre-tax in 2012. Theydelivered. Despite tepid U.S. growth and weakening economies throughout much of the world, our“powerhouse five” had aggregate earnings of $10.1 billion, about $600 million more than in 2011.\nOf this group, only MidAmerican, then earning $393 million pre-tax, was owned by Berkshire eight years\nago. Subsequently, we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth,BNSF, we paid about 70% of the cost in cash, and for the remainder, issued shares that increased theamount outstanding by 6.1%. Consequently, the $9.7 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshireby the five companies has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfies our goal of not simplygrowing, but rather increasing per-share results.\nUnless the U.S. economy tanks – which we don’t expect – our powerhouse five should again deliver higher\nearnings in 2013. The five outstanding CEOs who run them will see to that.\nŠThough I failed to land a major acquisition in 2012, the managers of our subsidiaries did far better. We hada record year for “bolt-on” purchases, spending about $2.3 billion for 26 companies that were melded intoour existing businesses. These transactions were completed without Berkshire issuing anyshares.\nCharlie and I love these acquisitions: Usually they are low-risk, burden headquarters not at all, and expand\nthe scope of our proven managers.\nŠOur insurance operations shot the lights out last year. While giving Berkshire $73 billion of freemoney to\ninvest, they also delivered a $1.6 billion underwriting gain, the tenth consecutive year of profitableunderwriting. This is truly having your cake and eating it too.\nGEICO led the way, continuing to gobble up market share without sacrificing underwriting discipline.Since 1995, when we obtained control, GEICO’s share of the personal-auto market has grown from 2.5% to9.7%. Premium volume meanwhile increased from $2.8 billion to $16.7 billion. Much more growth liesahead.\nThe credit for GEICO’s extraordinary performance goes to Tony Nicely and his 27,000 associates. And to\nthat cast, we should add our Gecko. Neither rain nor storm nor gloom of night can stop him; the little lizardjust soldiers on, telling Americans how they can save big money by going to GEICO.com.\nWhen I count my blessings, I count GEICO twice.\n4\n\nŠTodd Combs and Ted Weschler, our new investment managers, have proved to be smart, models of\nintegrity, helpful to Berkshire in many ways beyond portfolio management, and a perfect cultural fit. Wehit the jackpot with these two. In 2012 each outperformed the S&P 500 by double-digit margins.\nThey left me in\nthe dust as well .\nConsequently, we have increased the funds managed by each to almost $5 billion (some of this emanating\nfrom the pension funds of our subsidiaries). Todd and Ted are young and will be around to manageBerkshire’s massive portfolio long after Charlie and I have left the scene. You can rest easy when theytake over.\nŠBerkshire’s yearend employment totaled a record 288,462 (see page 106 for details), up 17,604 from lastyear. Our headquarters crew, however, remained unchanged at 24. No sense going crazy.\nŠBerkshire’s “Big Four” investments – American Express, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo – all had goodyears. Our ownership interest in each of these companies increased during the year. We purchasedadditional shares of Wells Fargo (our ownership now is 8.7% versus 7.6% at yearend 2011) and IBM (6.0%versus 5.5%). Meanwhile, stock repurchases at Coca-Cola and American Express raised our percentageownership. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from 8.8% to 8.9% and our interest at American Express from13.0% to 13.7%.\nBerkshire’s ownership interest in all four companies is likely to increase in the future. Mae West had itright: “Too much of a good thing can be wonderful.”\nThe four companies possess marvelous businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and\nshareholder-oriented. At Berkshire we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of awonderful business to owning 100% of a so-so business. Our flexibility in capital allocation gives us asignificant advantage over companies that limit themselves only to acquisitions they can operate.\nGoing by our yearend share count, our portion of the “Big Four’s” 2012 earnings amounted to $3.9 billion.\nIn the earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends we receive – about $1.1 billion.But make no mistake: The $2.8 billion of earnings we do not report is every bit as valuable to us as whatwe record.\nThe earnings that the four companies retain are often used for repurchases – which enhance our share of\nfuture earnings – and also for funding business opportunities that are usually advantageous. Over time weexpect substantially greater earnings from these four investees. If we are correct, dividends to Berkshirewill increase and, even more important, so will our unrealized capital gains (which, for the four, totaled$26.7 billion at yearend).\nŠThere was a lot of hand-wringing last year among CEOs who cried “uncertainty” when faced with capital-allocation decisions (despite many of their businesses having enjoyed record levels of both earnings andcash). At Berkshire, we didn’t share their fears, instead spending a record $9.8 billion on plant andequipment in 2012, about 88% of it in the United States. That’s 19% more than we spent in 2011, ourprevious high. Charlie and I love investing large sums in worthwhile projects, whatever the pundits aresaying. We instead heed the words from Gary Allan’s new country song, “Every Storm Runs Out of Rain.”\nWe will keep our foot to the floor and will almost certainly set still another record for capital expendituresin 2013. Opportunities abound in America.\n************\nA thought for my fellow CEOs: Of course, the immediate future is uncertain; America has faced theunknown since 1776. It’s just that sometimes people focus on the myriad of uncertainties that always existwhile at other times they ignore them (usually because the recent past has been uneventful).\n5\n\nAmerican business will do fine over time. And stocks will do well just as certainly, since their fate is tied\nto business performance. Periodic setbacks will occur, yes, but investors and managers are in a game thatis heavily stacked in their favor. (The Dow Jones Industrials advanced from 66 to 11,497 in the 20\nth\nCentury, a staggering 17,320% increase that materialized despite four costly wars, a Great Depression andmany recessions. And don’t forget that shareholders received substantial dividends throughout the centuryas well.)\nSince the basic game is so favorable, Charlie and I believe it’s a terrible mistake to try to dance in and out\nof it based upon the turn of tarot cards, the predictions of “experts,” or the ebb and flow of businessactivity. The risks of being out of the game are huge compared to the risks of being in it.\nMy own history provides a dramatic example: I made my first stock purchase in the spring of 1942 when\nthe U.S. was suffering major losses throughout the Pacific war zone. Each day’s headlines told of moresetbacks. Even so, there was no talk about uncertainty; every American I knew believed we would prevail.\nThe country’s success since that perilous time boggles the mind: On an inflation-adjusted basis, GDP per\ncapita more than quadrupled between 1941 and 2012. Throughout that period, every tomorrow has been\nuncertain. America’s destiny, however, has always been clear: ever-increasing abundance.\nIf you are a CEO who has some large, profitable project you are shelving because of short-term worries,\ncall Berkshire. Let us unburden you.\n************\nIn summary, Charlie and I hope to build per-share intrinsic value by (1) improving the earning power of our\nmany subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earnings through bolt-on acquisitions; (3) participating in the growthof our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shares when they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsicvalue; and (5) making an occasional large acquisition. We will also try to maximize results for youby rarely, if\never, issuing Berkshire shares.\nThose building blocks rest on a rock-solid foundation. A century hence, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy\nwill continue to play major roles in the American economy. Insurance, moreover, will always be essential for bothbusinesses and individuals – and no company brings greater resources to that arena than Berkshire. As we viewthese and other strengths, Charlie and I like your company’s prospects.\nIntrinsic Business Value\nAs much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that number\nis for Berkshire shares (or, for that matter, any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid out thethree elements – one of which was qualitative – that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire’sintrinsic value. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 104-105.\nHere is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2012 our per-share investments increased 15.7% to\n$113,786, and our per-share pre-tax earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments also increased15.7% to $8,085.\nSince 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 19.4% compounded annually, and our\nper-share earnings figure has grown at a 20.8% clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the42-year period has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to seegains in both areas, but our strong emphasis will always be on building operating earnings.\n************\nNow, let’s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and\nincome characteristics from the others. Lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. So we’ll present themas four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them.\n6\n\nInsurance\nLet’s look first at insurance, Berkshire’s core operation and the engine that has propelled our expansion\nover the years.\nProperty-casualty (“P/C”) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such\nas those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others.Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire’s benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go,the amount of float we hold remains quite stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our businessgrows, so does our float. And howwe have grown, as the following table shows:\nYear\nFloat (in $ millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322012 73,125\nLast year I told you that our float was likely to level off or even decline a bit in the future. Our insurance\nCEOs set out to prove me wrong and did, increasing float last year by $2.5 billion. I now expect a further increase\nin 2013. But further gains will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO’s float will almost certainly grow. InNational Indemnity’s reinsurance division, however, we have a number of run-off contracts whose float driftsdownward. If we do experience a decline in float at some future time, it will be very gradual – at the outside no\nmore than 2% in any year.\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money– and, better yet, get paid for holding it. That’s like your taking out a loan and having the bank pay youinterest.\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous\nin most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in\neffect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State Farm, by far the country’s largest insurer and awell-managed company besides, incurred an underwriting loss in eight of the eleven years ending in 2011. (Theirfinancials for 2012 are not yet available.) There are a lot of ways to lose money in insurance, and the industry neverceases searching for new ones.\nAs noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for ten\nconsecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $18.6 billion. Looking ahead, I believe we willcontinue to underwrite profitably in most years. If we do, our float will be better than free money.\nSo how does our attractive float affect the calculations of intrinsic value? When Berkshire’s book value is\ncalculated, the fullamount of our float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and were\nunable to replenish it. But that’s an incorrect way to look at float, which should instead be viewed as a revolvingfund. If float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe Berkshire’s will be, the true value of this liability isdramatically less than the accounting liability.\nA partial offset to this overstated liability is $15.5 billion of “goodwill” that is attributable to our insurance\ncompanies and included in book value as an asset. In effect, this goodwill represents the price we paid for the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing on its true\nvalue. For example, if an insurance business sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwill assetcarried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\n7\n\nFortunately, that’s not the case at Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our insurance\ngoodwill – what we would happily pay to purchase an insurance operation producing float of similar quality –t ob e\nfar in excess of its historic carrying value. The value of our float is one reason – a huge reason – why we believeBerkshire’s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.\nLet me emphasize once again that cost-free float is notan outcome to be expected for the P/C industry as a\nwhole: There is very little “Berkshire-quality” float existing in the insurance world. In 37 of the 45 years ending in2011, the industry’s premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the industry’soverall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized by Americanindustry, a sorry performance almost certain to continue.\nA further unpleasant reality adds to the industry’s dim prospects: Insurance earnings are now benefitting\nfrom “legacy” bond portfolios that deliver much higher yields than will be available when funds are reinvestedduring the next few years – and perhaps for many years beyond that. Today’s bond portfolios are, in effect, wastingassets. Earnings of insurers will be hurt in a significant way as bonds mature and are rolled over.\n************\nBerkshire’s outstanding economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running some\nextraordinary insurance operations. Let me tell you about the major units.\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, run by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks that no\none else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, mostimportant, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that areinappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are farmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large\ninsurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe– a loss about triple anything it has ever experienced – Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profitfor the year because it has so many streams of earnings. All other major insurers and reinsurers would meanwhilebe far in the red, with some facing insolvency.\nFrom a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $35 billion and a\nsignificant cumulative underwriting profit, a feat that no other insurance CEO has come close to matching. He hasthus added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire. If you meet Ajit at the annual meeting, bowdeeply.\n************\nWe have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.\nAt bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actuallycausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after bothprospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriatepremium can’t be obtained.\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can’t turn their back on business\nthat is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, “The other guy is doing it, so we must as well,”spells trouble in any business, but none more so than insurance.\n8\n\nTad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re’s huge\nfloat has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, it will continue to be. Weare particularly enthusiastic about General Re’s international life reinsurance business, which has achievedconsistent and profitable growth since we acquired the company in 1998.\n************\nFinally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 62 years ago. GEICO is run by Tony Nicely,\nwho joined the company at 18 and completed 51 years of service in 2012.\nI rub my eyes when I look at what Tony has accomplished. Last year, it should be noted, his record was\nconsiderably better than is indicated by GEICO’s GAAP underwriting profit of $680 million. Because of a changein accounting rules at the beginning of the year, we recorded a charge to GEICO’s underwriting earnings of$410 million. This item had nothing to do with 2012’s operating results, changing neither cash, revenues, expenses\nnor taxes. In effect, the writedown simply widened the already huge difference between GEICO’s intrinsic valueand the value at which we carry it on our books.\nGEICO earned its underwriting profit, moreover, despite the company suffering its largest single loss in\nhistory. The cause was Hurricane Sandy, which cost GEICO more than three times the loss it sustained fromKatrina, the previous record-holder. We insured 46,906 vehicles that were destroyed or damaged in the storm, astaggering number reflecting GEICO’s leading market share in the New York metropolitan area.\nLast year GEICO enjoyed a meaningful increase in both the renewal rate for existing policyholders\n(“persistency”) and in the percentage of rate quotations that resulted in sales (“closures”). Big dollars ride on thosetwo factors: A sustained gain in persistency of a bare one percentage point increases intrinsic value by more than$1 billion. GEICO’s gains in 2012 offer dramatic proof that when people check the company’s prices, they usuallyfind they can save important sums. (Give us a try at 1-800-847-7536 or GEICO.com. Be sure to mention that you are ashareholder; that fact will usually result in a discount.)\n************\nIn addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them\nplying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. In aggregate, these companies have consistently deliveredan underwriting profit. Moreover, as the table below shows, they also provide us with substantial float. Charlie andI treasure these companies and their managers.\nLate in 2012, we enlarged this group by acquiring Guard Insurance, a Wilkes-Barre company that writes\nworkers compensation insurance, primarily for smaller businesses. Guard’s annual premiums total about $300million. The company has excellent prospects for growth in both its traditional business and new lines it has begunto offer.\nUnderwriting Profit\nYearend Float\n(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2012 2011 2012 2011\nBH Reinsurance ......... $ 3 0 4 $(714) $34,821 $33,728\nGeneral Re ............. 3 5 5 1 4 4 20,128 19,714\nGEICO ................ 680* 576 11,578 11,169\nOther Primary .......... 2 8 6 2 4 2 6,598 5,960\n$1,625 $ 248 $73,125 $70,571\n*After a $410 million charge against earnings arising from an industry-wide accounting change.\nAmong large insurance operations, Berkshire’s impresses me as the best in the world. It was our lucky day\nwhen, in March 1967, Jack Ringwalt sold us his two property-casualty insurers for $8.6 million.\n9\n\nRegulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\nWe have two major operations, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, that have important common\ncharacteristics distinguishing them from our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section inthis letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.\nA key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, with\nthese partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact\nnot needed because each business has earning power that even under terrible conditions amply covers its interestrequirements. In last year’s tepid economy, for example, BNSF’s interest coverage was 9.6x. (Our definition ofcoverage is pre-tax earnings/interest, notEBITDA/interest, a commonly-used measure we view as deeply flawed.)\nAt MidAmerican, meanwhile, two key factors ensure its ability to service debt under all circumstances: thecompany’s recession-resistant earnings, which result from our exclusively offering an essential service, and its greatdiversity of earnings streams, which shield it from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body.\nEvery day, our two subsidiaries power the American economy in major ways:\nŠBNSF carries about 15% (measured by ton-miles) of allinter-city freight, whether it is transported by\ntruck, rail, water, air, or pipeline. Indeed, we move more ton-miles of goods than anyone else, a fact\nmaking BNSF the most important artery in our economy’s circulatory system.\nBNSF also moves its cargo in an extraordinarily fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly way, carrying aton of freight about 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. Trucks taking on the same job guzzle aboutfour times as much fuel.\nŠMidAmerican’s electric utilities serve regulated retail customers in ten states. Only one utility holdingcompany serves more states. In addition, we are the leader in renewables: first, from a standing start nineyears ago, we now account for 6% of the country’s wind generation capacity. Second, when we completethree projects now under construction, we will own about 14% of U.S. solar-generation capacity.\nProjects like these require huge capital investments. Upon completion, indeed, our renewables portfolio\nwill have cost $13 billion. We relish making such commitments if they promise reasonable returns – and on thatfront, we put a large amount of trust in future regulation.\nOur confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever need\nmassive investment in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capitalproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. And it is in our self-interestto conduct our operations in a manner that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.\nOur managers must think today of what the country will need far down the road. Energy and transportation\nprojects can take many years to come to fruition; a growing country simply can’t afford to get behind the curve.\nWe have been doing our part to make sure that doesn’t happen. Whatever you may have heard about our\ncountry’s crumbling infrastructure in no way applies to BNSF or railroads generally. America’s rail system hasnever been in better shape, a consequence of huge investments by the industry. We are not, however, resting on ourlaurels: BNSF will spend about $4 billion on the railroad in 2013, roughly double its depreciation charge and morethan any railroad has spent in a single year.\n10\n\nIn Matt Rose, at BNSF, and Greg Abel, at MidAmerican, we have two outstanding CEOs. They are\nextraordinary managers who have developed businesses that serve both their customers and owners well. Each hasmy gratitude and each deserves yours. Here are the key figures for their businesses:\nMidAmerican (89.8% owned)\nEarnings (in millions)\n2012 2011\nU.K. utilities .................................................... $ 4 2 9 $ 4 6 9\nIowa utility ..................................................... 2 3 6 2 7 9\nWestern utilities ................................................. 7 3 7 7 7 1\nPipelines ....................................................... 3 8 3 3 8 8\nHomeServices ................................................... 8 2 3 9\nOther (net) ...................................................... 9 1 3 6\nOperating earnings before corporate interest and taxes ................... 1,958 1,982\nInterest ........................................................ 3 1 4 3 3 6\nIncome taxes .................................................... 1 7 2 3 1 5\nNet earnings .................................................... $ 1,472 $ 1,331\nEarnings applicable to Berkshire .................................... $ 1,323 $ 1,204\nBNSF Earnings (in millions)\n2012 2011\nRevenues ....................................................... $20,835 $19,548\nOperating expenses ............................................... 14,835 14,247\nOperating earnings before interest and taxes ........................... 6,000 5,301\nInterest (net) .................................................... 6 2 3 5 6 0\nIncome taxes .................................................... 2,005 1,769\nNet earnings .................................................... $ 3,372 $ 2,972\nSharp-eyed readers will notice an incongruity in the MidAmerican earnings tabulation. What in the world\nis HomeServices, a real estate brokerage operation, doing in a section entitled “Regulated, Capital-IntensiveBusinesses?”\nWell, its ownership came with MidAmerican when we bought control of that company in 2000. At that\ntime, I focused on MidAmerican’s utility operations and barely noticed HomeServices, which then owned only afew real estate brokerage companies.\nSince then, however, the company has regularly added residential brokers – three in 2012 – and now has\nabout 16,000 agents in a string of major U.S. cities. (Our real estate brokerage companies are listed on page 107.)In 2012, our agents participated in $42 billion of home sales, up 33% from 2011.\nAdditionally, HomeServices last year purchased 67% of the Prudential and Real Living franchise\noperations, which together license 544 brokerage companies throughout the country and receive a small royalty ontheir sales. We have an arrangement to purchase the balance of those operations within five years. In the comingyears, we will gradually rebrand both our franchisees and the franchise firms we own as Berkshire HathawayHomeServices.\nRon Peltier has done an outstanding job in managing HomeServices during a depressed period. Now, as\nthe housing market continues to strengthen, we expect earnings to rise significantly.\n11\n\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations\nOur activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront. Let’s look, though, at a summary balance sheet\nand earnings statement for the entire group.\nBalance Sheet 12/31/12 (in millions)\nAssets Liabilities and Equity\nCash and equivalents .............. $ 5,338 Notes payable ............... $ 1,454\nAccounts and notes receivable ....... 7,382 Other current liabilities ........ 8,527\nInventory ....................... 9,675 Total current liabilities ........ 9,981\nOther current assets ............... 7 3 4\nTotal current assets ................ 23,129\nDeferred taxes ............... 4,907\nGoodwill and other intangibles ...... 26,017 Term debt and other liabilities . . 5,826\nFixed assets ..................... 18,871 Non-controlling interests ...... 2,062\nOther assets ..................... 3,416 Berkshire equity ............. 48,657\n$71,433 $71,433\nEarnings Statement (in millions)\n2012 2011* 2010\nRevenues ............................................ $83,255 $72,406 $66,610\nOperating expenses .................................... 76,978 67,239 62,225\nInterest expense ....................................... 1 4 6 1 3 0 1 1 1\nPre-tax earnings ....................................... 6,131 5,037 4,274\nIncome taxes and non-controlling interests .................. 2,432 1,998 1,812\nNet earnings .......................................... $ 3,699 $ 3,039 $ 2,462\n*Includes earnings of Lubrizol from September 16.\nOur income and expense data conforming to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) is on\npage 29. In contrast, the operating expense figures above are non-GAAP. In particular, they exclude somepurchase-accounting items, primarily the amortization of certain intangible assets. We present the data in thismanner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers more accurately reflect the real expenses and profits ofthe businesses aggregated in the table.\nI won’t explain all of the adjustments – some are small and arcane – but serious investors should\nunderstand the disparate nature of intangible assets: Some truly deplete over time while others never lose value.With software, for example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Charges against other intangibles such asthe amortization of customer relationships, however, arise through purchase-accounting rules and are clearly not realexpenses. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both, that is, are recorded asexpenses when calculating earnings – even though from an investor’s viewpoint they could not be more different.\nIn the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 29, amortization charges of $600 million for the\ncompanies included in this section are deducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these “real” – and indeedthat is the portion we have included in the table above – and the rest not. This difference has become significantbecause of the many acquisitions we have made.\n“Non-real” amortization expense also looms large at some of our major investees. IBM has made many\nsmall acquisitions in recent years and now regularly reports “adjusted operating earnings,” a non-GAAP figure thatexcludes certain purchase-accounting adjustments. Analysts focus on this number, as they should.\n12\n\nA “non-real” amortization charge at Wells Fargo, however, is not highlighted by the company and never, to\nmy knowledge, has been noted in analyst reports. The earnings that Wells Fargo reports are heavily burdened by an“amortization of core deposits” charge, the implication being that these deposits are disappearing at a fairly rapidclip. Yet core deposits regularly increase . The charge last year was about $1.5 billion. In nosense, except GAAP\naccounting, is this whopping charge an expense.\nAnd that ends today’s accounting lecture. Why is no one shouting “More, more?”\n************\nThe crowd of companies in this section sell products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of the\nbusinesses enjoy terrific economics, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets that run from 25%\nafter-tax to more than 100%. Others produce good returns in the area of 12-20%. A few, however, have very poorreturns, a result of some serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation.\nMore than 50 years ago, Charlie told me that it was far better to buy a wonderful business at a fair price\nthan to buy a fair business at a wonderful price. Despite the compelling logic of his position, I have sometimesreverted to my old habit of bargain-hunting, with results ranging from tolerable to terrible. Fortunately, my mistakeshave usually occurred when I made smaller purchases. Our large acquisitions have generally worked out well and,in a few cases, more than well.\nViewed as a single entity, therefore, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employ\n$22.6 billion of net tangible assets and, on that base, earned 16.3% after-tax.\nOf course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if the price paid is excessive. We\nhave paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the largefigure we show for intangible assets. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we havedeployed in this sector. Furthermore, the intrinsic value of the businesses, in aggregate, exceeds their carrying valueby a good margin. Even so, the difference between intrinsic value and carrying value in the insurance and regulated-industry segments is fargreater. It is there that the huge winners reside.\n************\nMarmon provides an example of a clear and substantial gap existing between book value and intrinsic\nvalue. Let me explain the odd origin of this differential.\nLast year I told you that we had purchased additional shares in Marmon, raising our ownership to 80% (up\nfrom the 64% we acquired in 2008). I also told you that GAAP accounting required us to immediately record the2011 purchase on our books at far less than what we paid. I’ve now had a year to think about this weird accountingrule, but I’ve yet to find an explanation that makes anysense – nor can Charlie or Marc Hamburg, our CFO, come\nup with one. My confusion increases when I am told that if we hadn’t already owned 64%, the 16% we purchasedin 2011 would have been entered on our books at our cost.\nIn 2012 (and in early 2013, retroactive to yearend 2012) we acquired an additional 10% of Marmon and the\nsame bizarre accounting treatment was required. The $700 million write-off we immediately incurred had no effecton earnings but did reduce book value and, therefore, 2012’s gain in net worth.\nThe cost of our recent 10% purchase implies a $12.6 billion value for the 90% of Marmon we now own.\nOur balance-sheet carrying value for the 90%, however, is $8 billion. Charlie and I believe our current purchaserepresents excellent value. If we are correct, our Marmon holding is worth at least $4.6 billion more than itscarrying value.\nMarmon is a diverse enterprise, comprised of about 150 companies operating in a wide variety of\nindustries. Its largest business involves the ownership of tank cars that are leased to a variety of shippers, such as oiland chemical companies. Marmon conducts this business through two subsidiaries, Union Tank Car in the U.S. andProcor in Canada.\n13\n\nUnion Tank Car has been around a long time, having been owned by the Standard Oil Trust until that\nempire was broken up in 1911. Look for its UTLX logo on tank cars when you watch trains roll by. As a Berkshireshareholder, you own the cars with that insignia. When you spot a UTLX car, puff out your chest a bit and enjoy thesame satisfaction that John D. Rockefeller undoubtedly experienced as he viewed hisfleet a century ago.\nTank cars are owned by either shippers or lessors, not by railroads. At yearend Union Tank Car and Procor\ntogether owned 97,000 cars having a net book value of $4 billion. A new car, it should be noted, costs upwards of$100,000. Union Tank Car is also a major manufacturer of tank cars – some of them to be sold but most to beowned by it and leased out. Today, its order book extends well into 2014.\nAt both BNSF and Marmon, we are benefitting from the resurgence of U.S. oil production. In fact, our\nrailroad is now transporting about 500,000 barrels of oil daily, roughly 10% of the total produced in the “lower 48”(i.e. not counting Alaska and offshore). All indications are that BNSF’s oil shipments will grow substantially incoming years.\n************\nSpace precludes us from going into detail about the many other businesses in this segment. Company-\nspecific information about the 2012 operations of some of the larger units appears on pages 76 to 79.\nFinance and Financial Products\nThis sector, our smallest, includes two rental companies, XTRA (trailers) and CORT (furniture), as well as\nClayton Homes, the country’s leading producer and financer of manufactured homes. Aside from these 100%-owned subsidiaries, we also include in this category a collection of financial assets and our 50% interest in BerkadiaCommercial Mortgage.\nWe include Clayton in this sector because it owns and services 332,000 mortgages, totaling $13.7 billion.\nIn large part, these loans have been made to lower and middle-income families. Nevertheless, the loans haveperformed well throughout the housing collapse, thereby validating our conviction that a reasonable down paymentand a sensible payments-to-income ratio will ward off outsized foreclosure losses, even during stressful times.\nClayton also produced 25,872 manufactured homes last year, up 13.5% from 2011. That output accounted\nfor about 4.8% of all single-family residences built in the country, a share that makes Clayton America’s numberone homebuilder.\nCORT and XTRA are leaders in their industries as well. Our expenditures for new rental equipment at\nXTRA totaled $256 million in 2012, more than double its depreciation expense. While competitors fret abouttoday’s uncertainties, XTRA is preparing for tomorrow.\nBerkadia continues to do well. Our partners at Leucadia do most of the work in this venture, an\narrangement that Charlie and I happily embrace.\nHere’s the pre-tax earnings recap for this sector:\n2012 2011\n(in millions)\nBerkadia ........................ $ 3 5 $ 2 5\nClayton ......................... 2 5 5 1 5 4\nCORT .......................... 4 2 2 9\nXTRA .......................... 1 0 6 1 2 6\nNet financial income* ............. 4 1 0 4 4 0\n$848 $774\n*Excludes capital gains or losses\n14\n\nInvestments\nBelow we show our common stock investments that at yearend had a market value of more than $1 billion.\n12/31/12\nShares CompanyPercentage of\nCompany\nOwnedCost* Market\n(in millions)\n151,610,700 American Express Company .............. 13.7 $ 1,287 $ 8,715\n400,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company ................. 8 . 9 1,299 14,500\n24,123,911 ConocoPhillips ......................... 2 . 0 1,219 1,399\n22,999,600 DIRECTV ............................ 3 . 8 1,057 1,154\n68,115,484 International Business Machines Corp. ...... 6 . 0 11,680 13,048\n28,415,250 Moody’s Corporation .................... 12.7 287 1,430\n20,060,390 Munich Re ............................ 11.3 2,990 3,599\n20,668,118 Phillips 66 ............................ 3 . 3 6 6 0 1,097\n3,947,555 POSCO ............................... 5 . 1 7 6 8 1,295\n52,477,678 The Procter & Gamble Company ........... 1 . 9 3 3 6 3,563\n25,848,838 Sanofi ................................ 2 . 0 2,073 2,438\n415,510,889 Tesco plc ............................. 5 . 2 2,350 2,268\n78,060,769 U.S. Bancorp .......................... 4 . 2 2,401 2,493\n54,823,433 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. .................... 1 . 6 2,837 3,741\n456,170,061 Wells Fargo & Company ................. 8 . 7 10,906 15,592\nOthers ................................ 7,646 11,330\nTotal Common Stocks Carried at Market .... $49,796 $87,662\n*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP “cost” differs in a few cases because of\nwrite-ups or write-downs that have been required.\nOne point about the composition of this list deserves mention. In Berkshire’s past annual reports, every\nstock itemized in this space has been bought by me, in the sense that I made the decision to buy it for Berkshire. Butstarting with this list, any investment made by Todd Combs or Ted Weschler – or a combined purchase by them –that meets the dollar threshold for the list ($1 billion this year) will be included. Above is the first such stock,DIRECTV, which both Todd and Ted hold in their portfolios and whose combined holdings at the end of 2012 werevalued at the $1.15 billion shown.\nTodd and Ted also manage the pension funds of certain Berkshire subsidiaries, while others, for regulatory\nreasons, are managed by outside advisers. We do not include holdings of the pension funds in our annual reporttabulations, though their portfolios often overlap Berkshire’s.\n************\nWe continue to wind down the part of our derivatives portfolio that involved the assumption by Berkshire\nof insurance-like risks. (Our electric and gas utility businesses, however, will continue to use derivatives foroperational purposes.) New commitments would require us to post collateral and, with minor exceptions, we areunwilling to do that. Markets can behave in extraordinary ways, and we have no interest in exposing Berkshire tosome out-of-the-blue event in the financial world that might require our posting mountains of cash on a moment’snotice.\nCharlie and I believe in operating with many redundant layers of liquidity, and we avoid any sort of\nobligation that could drain our cash in a material way. That reduces our returns in 99 years out of 100. But we willsurvive in the 100\nthwhile many others fail. And we will sleep well in all 100.\n15\n\nThe derivatives we have sold that provide credit protection for corporate bonds will all expire in the next\nyear. It’s now almost certain that our profit from these contracts will approximate $1 billion pre-tax. We also\nreceived very substantial sums upfront on these derivatives, and the “float” attributable to them has averaged about$2 billion over their five-year lives. All told, these derivatives have provided a more-than-satisfactory result,especially considering the fact that we were guaranteeing corporate credits – mostly of the high-yield variety –throughout the financial panic and subsequent recession.\nIn our other major derivatives commitment, we sold long-term puts on four leading stock indices in the\nU.S., U.K., Europe and Japan. These contracts were initiated between 2004 and 2008 and even under the worst ofcircumstances have only minor collateral requirements. In 2010 we unwound about 10% of our exposure at a profitof $222 million. The remaining contracts expire between 2018 and 2026. Only the index value at expiration datecounts; our counterparties have no right to early termination.\nBerkshire received premiums of $4.2 billion when we wrote the contracts that remain outstanding. If all of\nthese contracts had come due at yearend 2011, we would have had to pay $6.2 billion; the corresponding figure atyearend 2012 was $3.9 billion. With this large drop in immediate settlement liability, we reduced our GAAPliability at yearend 2012 to $7.5 billion from $8.5 billion at the end of 2011. Though it’s no sure thing, Charlie and Ibelieve it likely that the final liability will be considerably less than the amount we currently carry on our books. Inthe meantime, we can invest the $4.2 billion of float derived from these contracts as we see fit.\nWe Buy Some Newspapers . . . Newspapers?\nDuring the past fifteen months, we acquired 28 daily newspapers at a cost of $344 million. This may\npuzzle you for two reasons. First, I have long told you in these letters and at our annual meetings that thecirculation, advertising and profits of the newspaper industry overall are certain to decline. That prediction still\nholds. Second, the properties we purchased fell far short of meeting our oft-stated size requirements foracquisitions.\nWe can address the second point easily. Charlie and I love newspapers and, if their economics make sense ,\nwill buy them even when they fall far short of the size threshold we would require for the purchase of, say, a widgetcompany. Addressing the first point requires me to provide a more elaborate explanation, including some history.\nNews, to put it simply, is what people don’t know that they want to know. And people will seek their news\n– what’s important to them – from whatever sources provide the best combination of immediacy, ease of access,\nreliability, comprehensiveness and low cost. The relative importance of these factors varies with the nature of thenews and the person wanting it.\nBefore television and the Internet, newspapers were the primary source for an incredible variety of news, a\nfact that made them indispensable to a very high percentage of the population. Whether your interests wereinternational, national, local, sports or financial quotations, your newspaper usually was first to tell you the latestinformation. Indeed, your paper contained so much you wanted to learn that you received your money’s worth, evenif only a small number of its pages spoke to your specific interests. Better yet, advertisers typically paid almost allof the product’s cost, and readers rode their coattails.\nAdditionally, the ads themselves delivered information of vital interest to hordes of readers, in effect\nproviding even more “news.” Editors would cringe at the thought, but for many readers learning what jobs orapartments were available, what supermarkets were carrying which weekend specials, or what movies were showingwhere and when was far more important than the views expressed on the editorial page.\n16\n\nIn turn, the local paper was indispensable to advertisers. If Sears or Safeway built stores in Omaha, they\nrequired a “megaphone” to tell the city’s residents why their stores should be visited today . Indeed, big department\nstores and grocers vied to outshout their competition with multi-page spreads, knowing that the goods theyadvertised would fly off the shelves. With no other megaphone remotely comparable to that of the newspaper, adssold themselves.\nAs long as a newspaper was the only one in its community, its profits were certain to be extraordinary;\nwhether it was managed well or poorly made little difference. (As one Southern publisher famously confessed, “Iowe my exalted position in life to two great American institutions – nepotism and monopoly.”)\nOver the years, almost all cities became one-newspaper towns (or harbored two competing papers that\njoined forces to operate as a single economic unit). This contraction was inevitable because most people wished toread and pay for only one paper. When competition existed, the paper that gained a significant lead in circulationalmost automatically received the most ads. That left ads drawing readers and readers drawing ads. This symbioticprocess spelled doom for the weaker paper and became known as “survival of the fattest.”\nNow the world has changed. Stock market quotes and the details of national sports events are old news\nlong before the presses begin to roll. The Internet offers extensive information about both available jobs and homes.Television bombards viewers with political, national and international news. In one area of interest after another,newspapers have therefore lost their “primacy.” And, as their audiences have fallen, so has advertising. (Revenuesfrom “help wanted” classified ads – long a huge source of income for newspapers – have plunged more than 90% inthe past 12 years.)\nNewspapers continue to reign supreme, however, in the delivery of local news. If you want to know what’s\ngoing on in your town – whether the news is about the mayor or taxes or high school football – there is no substitute\nfor a local newspaper that is doing its job. A reader’s eyes may glaze over after they take in a couple of paragraphsabout Canadian tariffs or political developments in Pakistan; a story about the reader himself or his neighbors willbe read to the end. Wherever there is a pervasive sense of community, a paper that serves the special informationalneeds of that community will remain indispensable to a significant portion of its residents.\nEven a valuable product, however, can self-destruct from a faulty business strategy. And that process has\nbeen underway during the past decade at almost all papers of size. Publishers – including Berkshire in Buffalo –have offered their paper free on the Internet while charging meaningful sums for the physical specimen. How couldthis lead to anything other than a sharp and steady drop in sales of the printed product? Falling circulation,moreover, makes a paper less essential to advertisers. Under these conditions, the “virtuous circle” of the pastreverses.\nThe Wall Street Journal went to a pay model early. But the main exemplar for local newspapers is the\nArkansas Democrat-Gazette , published by Walter Hussman, Jr. Walter also adopted a pay format early, and over\nthe past decade his paper has retained its circulation far better than any other large paper in the country. DespiteWalter’s powerful example, it’s only been in the last year or so that other papers, including Berkshire’s, haveexplored pay arrangements. Whatever works best – and the answer is not yet clear – will be copied widely.\n************\nCharlie and I believe that papers delivering comprehensive and reliable information to tightly-bound\ncommunities andhaving a sensible Internet strategy will remain viable for a long time. We do not believe that\nsuccess will come from cutting either the news content or frequency of publication. Indeed, skimpy news coveragewill almost certainly lead to skimpy readership. And the less-than-daily publication that is now being tried in somelarge towns or cities – while it may improve profits in the short term – seems certain to diminish the papers’relevance over time. Our goal is to keep our papers loaded with content of interest to our readers and to be paidappropriately by those who find us useful, whether the product they view is in their hands or on the Internet.\n17\n\nOur confidence is buttressed by the availability of Terry Kroeger’s outstanding management group at the\nOmaha World-Herald , a team that has the ability to oversee a large group of papers. The individual papers,\nhowever, will be independent in their news coverage and editorial opinions. (I voted for Obama; of our 12 dailiesthat endorsed a presidential candidate, 10 opted for Romney.)\nOur newspapers are certainly not insulated from the forces that have been driving revenues downward.\nStill, the six small dailies we owned throughout 2012 had unchanged revenues for the year, a result far superior tothat experienced by big-city dailies. Moreover, the two large papers we operated throughout the year – The Buffalo\nNews and the Omaha World-Herald – held their revenue loss to 3%, which was also an above-average outcome.\nAmong newspapers in America’s 50 largest metropolitan areas, our Buffalo and Omaha papers rank near the top incirculation penetration of their home territories.\nThis popularity is no accident: Credit the editors of those papers – Margaret Sullivan at the News and Mike\nReilly at the World-Herald — for delivering information that has made their publications indispensable to\ncommunity-interested readers. (Margaret, I regret to say, recently left us to join The New York Times , whose job\noffers are tough to turn down. That paper made a great hire, and we wish her the best.)\nBerkshire’s cash earnings from its papers will almost certainly trend downward over time. Even a sensible\nInternet strategy will not be able to prevent modest erosion. At our cost, however, I believe these papers will meetor exceed our economic test for acquisitions. Results to date support that belief.\nCharlie and I, however, still operate under economic principle 11 (detailed on page 99) and will not\ncontinue the operation of anybusiness doomed to unending losses. One daily paper that we acquired in a bulk\npurchase from Media General was significantly unprofitable under that company’s ownership. After analyzing thepaper’s results, we saw no remedy for the losses and reluctantly shut it down. All of our remaining dailies, however,should be profitable for a long time to come. (They are listed on page 108.) At appropriate prices – and thatmeans at a very low multiple of current earnings – we will purchase more papers of the type we like.\n************\nA milestone in Berkshire’s newspaper operations occurred at yearend when Stan Lipsey retired as publisher\nofThe Buffalo News . It’s no exaggeration for me to say that the News might now be extinct were it not for Stan.\nCharlie and I acquired the News in April 1977. It was an evening paper, dominant on weekdays but lacking\na Sunday edition. Throughout the country, the circulation trend was toward morning papers. Moreover, Sundaywas becoming ever more critical to the profitability of metropolitan dailies. Without a Sunday paper, the News was\ndestined to lose out to its morning competitor, which had a fat and entrenched Sunday product.\nWe therefore began to print a Sunday edition late in 1977. And then all hell broke loose. Our competitor\nsued us, and District Judge Charles Brieant, Jr. authored a harsh ruling that crippled the introduction of our paper.His ruling was later reversed – after 17 long months – in a 3-0 sharp rebuke by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.While the appeal was pending, we lost circulation, hemorrhaged money and stood in constant danger of going out ofbusiness.\nEnter Stan Lipsey, a friend of mine from the 1960s, who, with his wife, had sold Berkshire a small Omaha\nweekly. I found Stan to be an extraordinary newspaperman, knowledgeable about every aspect of circulation,production, sales and editorial. (He was a key person in gaining that small weekly a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.) Sowhen I was in big trouble at the News , I asked Stan to leave his comfortable way of life in Omaha to take over in\nBuffalo.\nHe never hesitated. Along with Murray Light, our editor, Stan persevered through four years of very dark\ndays until the News won the competitive struggle in 1982. Ever since, despite a difficult Buffalo economy, the\nperformance of the News has been exceptional. As both a friend and as a manager, Stan is simply the best.\n18\n\nDividends\nA number of Berkshire shareholders – including some of my good friends – would like Berkshire to pay a\ncash dividend. It puzzles them that we relish the dividends we receive from most of the stocks that Berkshire owns,but pay out nothing ourselves. So let’s examine when dividends do and don’t make sense for shareholders.\nA profitable company can allocate its earnings in various ways (which are not mutually exclusive). A\ncompany’s management should first examine reinvestment possibilities offered by its current business – projects tobecome more efficient, expand territorially, extend and improve product lines or to otherwise widen the economicmoat separating the company from its competitors.\nI ask the managers of our subsidiaries to unendingly focus on moat-widening opportunities, and they find\nmany that make economic sense. But sometimes our managers misfire. The usual cause of failure is that they startwith the answer they want and then work backwards to find a supporting rationale. Of course, the process issubconscious; that’s what makes it so dangerous.\nYour chairman has not been free of this sin. In Berkshire’s 1986 annual report, I described how twenty\nyears of management effort and capital improvements in our original textile business were an exercise in futility. Iwanted the business to succeed and wished my way into a series of bad decisions. (I even bought another New\nEngland textile company.) But wishing makes dreams come true only in Disney movies; it’s poison in business.\nDespite such past miscues, our first priority with available funds will always be to examine whether they\ncan be intelligently deployed in our various businesses. Our record $12.1 billion of fixed-asset investments and bolt-\non acquisitions in 2012 demonstrate that this is a fertile field for capital allocation at Berkshire. And here we havean advantage: Because we operate in so many areas of the economy, we enjoy a range of choices far wider than thatopen to most corporations. In deciding what to do, we can water the flowers and skip over the weeds.\nEven after we deploy hefty amounts of capital in our current operations, Berkshire will regularly generate a\nlot of additional cash. Our next step, therefore, is to search for acquisitions unrelated to our current businesses.Here our test is simple: Do Charlie and I think we can effect a transaction that is likely to leave our shareholderswealthier on a per-share basis than they were prior to the acquisition?\nI have made plenty of mistakes in acquisitions and will make more. Overall, however, our record is\nsatisfactory, which means that our shareholders are farwealthier today than they would be if the funds we used for\nacquisitions had instead been devoted to share repurchases or dividends.\nBut, to use the standard disclaimer, past performance is no guarantee of future results. That’s particularly\ntrue at Berkshire: Because of our present size, making acquisitions that are both meaningful and sensible is nowmore difficult than it has been during most of our years.\nNevertheless, a large deal still offers us possibilities to add materially to per-share intrinsic value. BNSF is\na case in point: It is now worth considerably more than our carrying value. Had we instead allocated the fundsrequired for this purchase to dividends or repurchases, you and I would have been worse off. Though largetransactions of the BNSF kind will be rare, there are still some whales in the ocean.\nThe third use of funds – repurchases – is sensible for a company when its shares sell at a meaningful\ndiscount to conservatively calculated intrinsic value. Indeed, disciplined repurchases are the surest way to use funds\nintelligently: It’s hard to go wrong when you’re buying dollar bills for 80¢ or less. We explained our criteria forrepurchases in last year’s report and, if the opportunity presents itself, we will buy large quantities of our stock. Weoriginally said we would not pay more than 110% of book value, but that proved unrealistic. Therefore, weincreased the limit to 120% in December when a large block became available at about 116% of book value.\n19\n\nBut never forget: In repurchase decisions, price is all-important. Value is destroyed when purchases are\nmade above intrinsic value. The directors and I believe that continuing shareholders are benefitted in a meaningfulway by purchases up to our 120% limit.\nAnd that brings us to dividends. Here we have to make a few assumptions and use some math. The\nnumbers will require careful reading, but they are essential to understanding the case for and against dividends. Sobear with me.\nWe’ll start by assuming that you and I are the equal owners of a business with $2 million of net worth. The\nbusiness earns 12% on tangible net worth – $240,000 – and can reasonably expect to earn the same 12% onreinvested earnings. Furthermore, there are outsiders who always wish to buy into our business at 125% of networth. Therefore, the value of what we each own is now $1.25 million.\nYou would like to have the two of us shareholders receive one-third of our company’s annual earnings and\nhave two-thirds be reinvested. That plan, you feel, will nicely balance your needs for both current income andcapital growth. So you suggest that we pay out $80,000 of current earnings and retain $160,000 to increase thefuture earnings of the business. In the first year, your dividend would be $40,000, and as earnings grew and the one-third payout was maintained, so too would your dividend. In total, dividends and stock value would increase 8%each year (12% earned on net worth less 4% of net worth paid out).\nAfter ten years our company would have a net worth of $4,317,850 (the original $2 million compounded at\n8%) and your dividend in the upcoming year would be $86,357. Each of us would have shares worth $2,698,656(125% of our half of the company’s net worth). And we would live happily ever after – with dividends and thevalue of our stock continuing to grow at 8% annually.\nThere is an alternative approach, however, that would leave us even happier. Under this scenario, we\nwould leave allearnings in the company and each sell 3.2% of our shares annually. Since the shares would be sold\nat 125% of book value, this approach would produce the same $40,000 of cash initially, a sum that would growannually. Call this option the “sell-off” approach.\nUnder this “sell-off” scenario, the net worth of our company increases to $6,211,696 after ten years\n($2 million compounded at 12%). Because we would be selling shares each year, our percentage ownership would\nhave declined, and, after ten years, we would each own 36.12% of the business. Even so, your share of the networth of the company at that time would be $2,243,540. And, remember, every dollar of net worth attributable toeach of us can be sold for $1.25. Therefore, the market value of your remaining shares would be $2,804,425, about4% greater than the value of your shares if we had followed the dividend approach.\nMoreover, your annual cash receipts from the sell-off policy would now be running 4% more than you\nwould have received under the dividend scenario. Voila! – you would have both more cash to spend annually and\nmore capital value.\nThis calculation, of course, assumes that our hypothetical company can earn an average of 12% annually on\nnet worth and that its shareholders can sell their shares for an average of 125% of book value. To that point, theS&P 500 earns considerably more than 12% on net worth and sells at a price far above 125% of that net worth.Both assumptions also seem reasonable for Berkshire, though certainly not assured.\nMoreover, on the plus side, there also is a possibility that the assumptions will be exceeded. If they are, the\nargument for the sell-off policy becomes even stronger. Over Berkshire’s history – admittedly one that won’t comeclose to being repeated – the sell-off policy would have produced results for shareholders dramatically superior to\nthe dividend policy.\nAside from the favorable math, there are two further – and important – arguments for a sell-off policy.\nFirst, dividends impose a specific cash-out policy upon all shareholders. If, say, 40% of earnings is the policy, thosewho wish 30% or 50% will be thwarted. Our 600,000 shareholders cover the waterfront in their desires for cash. Itis safe to say, however, that a great many of them – perhaps even most of them – are in a net-savings mode andlogically should prefer no payment at all.\n20\n\nThe sell-off alternative, on the other hand, lets each shareholder make his own choice between cash receipts\nand capital build-up. One shareholder can elect to cash out, say, 60% of annual earnings while other shareholderselect 20% or nothing at all. Of course, a shareholder in our dividend-paying scenario could turn around and use hisdividends to purchase more shares. But he would take a beating in doing so: He would both incur taxes and also paya 25% premium to get his dividend reinvested. (Keep remembering, open-market purchases of the stock take placeat 125% of book value.)\nThe second disadvantage of the dividend approach is of equal importance: The tax consequences for all\ntaxpaying shareholders are inferior – usually farinferior – to those under the sell-off program. Under the dividend\nprogram, all of the cash received by shareholders each year is taxed whereas the sell-off program results in tax ononly the gain portion of the cash receipts.\nLet me end this math exercise – and I can hear you cheering as I put away the dentist drill – by using my\nown case to illustrate how a shareholder’s regular disposals of shares can be accompanied by an increased\ninvestment in his or her business. For the last seven years, I have annually given away about 4\n1⁄4%o fm yB e r k s h i r e\nshares. Through this process, my original position of 712,497,000 B-equivalent shares (split-adjusted) hasdecreased to 528,525,623 shares. Clearly my ownership percentage of the company has significantly decreased.\nYet my investment in the business has actually increased: The book value of my current interest in\nBerkshire considerably exceeds the book value attributable to my holdings of seven years ago. (The actual figuresare $28.2 billion for 2005 and $40.2 billion for 2012.) In other words, I now have farmore money working for me\nat Berkshire even though my ownership of the company has materially decreased. It’s also true that my share ofboth Berkshire’s intrinsic business value and the company’s normal earning power is far greater than it was in 2005.Over time, I expect this accretion of value to continue – albeit in a decidedly irregular fashion – even as I nowannually give away more than 4\n1⁄2% of my shares (the increase having occurred because I’ve recently doubled my\nlifetime pledges to certain foundations).\n************\nAbove all, dividend policy should always be clear, consistent and rational. A capricious policy will\nconfuse owners and drive away would-be investors. Phil Fisher put it wonderfully 54 years ago in Chapter 7 of hisCommon Stocks and Uncommon Profits , a book that ranks behind only The Intelligent Investor and the 1940 edition\nofSecurity Analysis in the all-time-best list for the serious investor. Phil explained that you can successfully run a\nrestaurant that serves hamburgers or, alternatively, one that features Chinese food. But you can’t switchcapriciously between the two and retain the fans of either.\nMost companies pay consistent dividends, generally trying to increase them annually and cutting them very\nreluctantly. Our “Big Four” portfolio companies follow this sensible and understandable approach and, in certaincases, also repurchase shares quite aggressively.\nWe applaud their actions and hope they continue on their present paths. We like increased dividends, and\nwe love repurchases at appropriate prices.\nAt Berkshire, however, we have consistently followed a different approach that we know has been sensible\nand that we hope has been made understandable by the paragraphs you have just read. We will stick with this policyas long as we believe our assumptions about the book-value buildup and the market-price premium seem reasonable.If the prospects for either factor change materially for the worse, we will reexamine our actions.\nThe Annual Meeting\nThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 4that the CenturyLink Center. Carrie Sova will be in\ncharge. (Though that’s a new name, it’s the same wonderful Carrie as last year; she got married in June to a verylucky guy.) All of our headquarters group pitches in to help her; the whole affair is a homemade production, and Icouldn’t be more proud of those who put it together.\n21\n\nThe doors will open at 7 a.m., and at 7:30 we will have our second International Newspaper Tossing\nChallenge. The target will be the porch of a Clayton Home, precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. Last year Isuccessfully fought off all challengers. But now Berkshire has acquired a large number of newspapers and withthem came much tossing talent (or so the throwers claim). Come see whether their talent matches their talk. Betteryet, join in. The papers will be 36 to 42 pages and you must fold them yourself (no rubber bands).\nAt 8:30, a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answer\nperiod, which (with a break for lunch at the CenturyLink’s stands) will last until 3:30. After a short recess, Charlieand I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decide to leave during the day’s question periods, please do sowhile Charlie is talking.\nThe best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We will help you do so by filling the 194,300-square-foot hall\nthat adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you did your part, andmost locations racked up record sales. In a nine-hour period, we sold 1,090 pairs of Justin boots, (that’s a pair every30 seconds), 10,010 pounds of See’s candy, 12,879 Quikut knives (24 knives per minute) and 5,784 pairs of WellsLamont gloves, always a hot item. But you can do better. Remember: Anyone who says money can’t buy happinesssimply hasn’t shopped at our meeting.\nLast year, Brooks, our running shoe company, exhibited for the first time and ran up sales of $150,000.\nBrooks is on fire: Its volume in 2012 grew 34%, and that was on top of a similar 34% gain in 2011. The company’smanagement expects another jump of 23% in 2013. We will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer atthe meeting.\nOn Sunday at 8 a.m., we will initiate the “Berkshire 5K,” a race starting at the CenturyLink. Full details for\nparticipating will be included in the Visitor’s Guide that you will receive with your credentials for the meeting. Wewill have plenty of categories for competition, including one for the media. (It will be fun to report on their\nperformance.) Regretfully, I will forego running; someone has to man the starting gun.\nI should warn you that we have a lot of home-grown talent. Ted Weschler has run the marathon in 3:01.\nJim Weber, Brooks’ dynamic CEO, is another speedster with a 3:31 best. Todd Combs specializes in the triathlon,but has been clocked at 22 minutes in the 5K.\nThat, however, is just the beginning: Our directors are also fleet of foot (that is, some of our directors are).\nSteve Burke has run an amazing 2:39 Boston marathon. (It’s a family thing; his wife, Gretchen, finished the NewYork marathon in 3:25.) Charlotte Guyman’s best is 3:37, and Sue Decker crossed the tape in New York in 3:36.Charlie did not return his questionnaire.\nGEICO will have a booth in the shopping area, staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the\ncountry. Stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount (usually 8%).This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental point: Thediscount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that given certain groups.) Bring the details of yourexisting insurance and check out whether we can save you money. For at least half of you, I believe we can.\nBe sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry about 35 books and DVDs, including a couple of new ones.\nCarol Loomis, who has been invaluable to me in editing this letter since 1977, has recently authored Tap Dancing to\nWork: Warren Buffett on Practically Everything . She and I have cosigned 500 copies, available exclusively at the\nmeeting.\nThe Outsiders , by William Thorndike, Jr., is an outstanding book about CEOs who excelled at capital\nallocation. It has an insightful chapter on our director, Tom Murphy, overall the best business manager I’ve evermet. I also recommend The Clash of the Cultures by Jack Bogle and Laura Rittenhouse’s Investing Between the\nLines . Should you need to ship your book purchases, a shipping service will be available nearby.\nTheOmaha World-Herald will again have a booth, offering a few books it has recently published. Red-\nblooded Husker fans – is there any Nebraskan who isn’t one? – will surely want to purchase Unbeatable . It tells the\nstory of Nebraska football during 1993-97, a golden era in which Tom Osborne’s teams went 60-3.\n22\n\nIf you are a big spender – or aspire to become one – visit Signature Aviation on the east side of the Omaha\nairport between noon and 5:00 p.m. on Saturday. There we will have a fleet of NetJets aircraft that will get yourpulse racing. Come by bus; leave by private jet. Live a little.\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. Airlines have sometimes jacked up pricesfor the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City versusOmaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2\n1⁄2hours, and it may be that you can save significant money,\nparticularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. Spend the savings with us.\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72ndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we will\nagain be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. Last year the store did $35.9 million of business during itsannual meeting sale, an all-time record that makes other retailers turn green. To obtain the Berkshire discount, youmust make your purchases between Tuesday, April 30\nthand Monday, May 6thinclusive, and also present your\nmeeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturersthat normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have madean exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday throughSaturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a picnicto which you are all invited.\nAt Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from\n6p . m .t o9p . m .o nF r i d a y ,M a y3rd. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 5th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nOn Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. In recent years, our three-day volume has far exceeded sales in all ofDecember, normally a jeweler’s best month.\nAround 1 p.m. on Sunday, I will begin clerking at Borsheims. Last year my sales totaled $1.5 million.\nThis year I won’t quit until I hit $2 million. Because I need to leave well before sundown, I will be desperate to dobusiness. Come take advantage of me. Ask for my “Crazy Warren” price.\nWe will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 29ththrough Saturday, May 11th. During that period, please\nidentify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that shows youare a Berkshire holder.\nOn Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, will\ntake on all comers – who will have their eyes wide open – in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, a remarkablemagician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, twoof the world’s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. Don’t playthem for money.\nGorat’s and Piccolo’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 5th. Both\nwill be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat’s opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo’s opening at 4 p.m. These restaurants aremy favorites, and I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening. Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call402-551-3733 on April 1\nst(but not before ) and at Piccolo’s call 402-342-9038. At Piccolo’s, order a giant root beer\nfloat for dessert. Only sissies get the small one. (I once saw Bill Gates polish off two of the giant variety after a\nfull-course dinner; that’s when I knew he would make a great director.)\nWe will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the meeting,\nasking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mailaddresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be emailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC,at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com, and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.\n23\n\nFrom the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most interesting\nand important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you keep itconcise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than two questions inany email you send them. (In your email, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if yourquestion is selected.)\nLast year we had a second panel of three analysts who follow Berkshire. All were insurance specialists,\nand shareholders subsequently indicated they wanted a little more variety. Therefore, this year we will have oneinsurance analyst, Cliff Gallant of Nomura Securities. Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb will join theanalyst panel to ask questions that deal with our non-insurance operations.\nFinally – to spice things up – we would like to add to the panel a credentialed bear on Berkshire, preferably\none who is short the stock. Not yet having a bear identified, we would like to hear from applicants. The onlyrequirement is that you be an investment professional and negative on Berkshire. The three analysts will bring theirown Berkshire-specific questions and alternate with the journalists and the audience in asking them.\nCharlie and I believe that all shareholders should have access to new Berkshire information simultaneously\nand should also have adequate time to analyze it, which is why we try to issue financial information after the marketclose on a Friday and why our annual meeting is held on Saturdays. We do not talk one-on-one to large institutionalinvestors or analysts. Our hope is that the journalists and analysts will ask questions that will further educateshareholders about their investment.\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the journalists\nand analysts will come up with some tough ones, and that’s the way we like it. All told, we expect at least 54questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and 18 from the audience. If there is some extratime, we will take more from the audience. Audience questioners will be determined by drawings that will takeplace at 8:15 a.m. at each of the 11 microphones located in the arena and main overflow room.\n************\nFor good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-\nStars, who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I believe their mindset to beas shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most have no financialneed to work; the joy of hitting business “home runs” means as much to them as their paycheck.\nEqually important, however, are the 23 men and women who work with me at our corporate office (all on\none floor, which is the way we intend to keep it!).\nThis group efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 21,500-page\nFederal income tax return as well as state and foreign returns, responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries,gets out the annual report, prepares for the country’s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board’s activities – andthe list goes on and on.\nThey handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy\nand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year they dealt with 48 universities(selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They also handle all kinds ofrequests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly dofeel like tap dancing to work every day.\nThis home office crew, along with our operating managers, has my deepest thanks and deserves yours as\nwell. Come to Omaha – the cradle of capitalism – on May 4thand chime in.\nMarch 1, 2013 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board\n24",

Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold atmarket rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire’sresults through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculatedusing the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-\ntax. If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its\nresults would have lagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded theS&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused theaggregate lag to be substantial.\n2\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshire’s gain in net worth during 2013 was $34.2 billion. That gain was after our deducting $1.8 billion\nof charges – meaningless economically, as I will explain later – that arose from our purchase of the minorityinterests in Marmon and Iscar. After those charges, the per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stockincreased by 18.2%. Over the last 49 years (that is, since present management took over), book value has grownfrom $19 to $134,973, a rate of 19.7% compounded annually.*\nOn the facing page, we show our long-standing performance measurement: The yearly change in\nBerkshire’s per-share book value versus the market performance of the S&P 500. What counts, of course, is per-share intrinsic value. But that’s a subjective figure, and book value is useful as a rough tracking indicator. (An\nextended discussion of intrinsic value is included in our Owner-Related Business Principles on pages 103 - 108.Those principles have been included in our reports for 30 years, and we urge new and prospective shareholders toread them.)\nAs I’ve long told you, Berkshire’s intrinsic value far exceeds its book value. Moreover, the difference has\nwidened considerably in recent years. That’s why our 2012 decision to authorize the repurchase of shares at 120%of book value made sense. Purchases at that level benefit continuing shareholders because per-share intrinsic valueexceeds that percentage of book value by a meaningful amount. We did not purchase shares during 2013, however,because the stock price did not descend to the 120% level. If it does, we will be aggressive.\nCharlie Munger, Berkshire’s vice chairman and my partner, and I believe both Berkshire’s book value and\nintrinsic value will outperform the S&P in years when the market is down or moderately up. We expect to fallshort, though, in years when the market is strong – as we did in 2013. We have underperformed in ten of our 49years, with all but one of our shortfalls occurring when the S&P gain exceeded 15%.\nOver the stock market cycle between yearends 2007 and 2013, we overperformed the S&P. Through full\ncycles in future years, we expect to do that again. If we fail to do so, we will not have earned our pay. After all, youcould always own an index fund and be assured of S&P results.\nThe Year at Berkshire\nOn the operating front, just about everything turned out well for us last year – in certain cases very well.\nLet me count the ways:\nŠWe completed two large acquisitions, spending almost $18 billion to purchase all of NV Energy and amajor interest in H. J. Heinz. Both companies fit us well and will be prospering a century from now.\nWith the Heinz purchase, moreover, we created a partnership template that may be used by Berkshire in\nfuture acquisitions of size. Here, we teamed up with investors at 3G Capital, a firm led by my friend, JorgePaulo Lemann. His talented associates – Bernardo Hees, Heinz’s new CEO, and Alex Behring, itsChairman – are responsible for operations.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are\n1/1500thof those shown for A.\n3\n\nBerkshire is the financing partner. In that role, we purchased $8 billion of Heinz preferred stock that\ncarries a 9% coupon but also possesses other features that should increase the preferred’s annual return to12% or so. Berkshire and 3G each purchased half of the Heinz common stock for $4.25 billion.\nThough the Heinz acquisition has some similarities to a “private equity” transaction, there is a crucial\ndifference: Berkshire never intends to sell a share of the company. What we would like, rather, is to buymore, and that could happen: Certain 3G investors may sell some or all of their shares in the future, andwe might increase our ownership at such times. Berkshire and 3G could also decide at some point that itwould be mutually beneficial if we were to exchange some of our preferred for common shares (at anequity valuation appropriate to the time).\nOur partnership took control of Heinz in June, and operating results so far are encouraging. Only minor\nearnings from Heinz, however, are reflected in those we report for Berkshire this year: One-time chargesincurred in the purchase and subsequent restructuring of operations totaled $1.3 billion. Earnings in 2014will be substantial.\nWith Heinz, Berkshire now owns 8\n1⁄2companies that, were they stand-alone businesses, would be in the\nFortune 500. Only 4911⁄2to go.\nNV Energy, purchased for $5.6 billion by MidAmerican Energy, our utility subsidiary, supplies electricity\nto about 88% of Nevada’s population. This acquisition fits nicely into our existing electric-utilityoperation and offers many possibilities for large investments in renewable energy. NV Energy will notbe\nMidAmerican’s last major acquisition.\nŠMidAmerican is one of our “Powerhouse Five” – a collection of large non-insurance businesses that, inaggregate, had a record $10.8 billion of pre-tax earnings in 2013, up $758 million from 2012. The othercompanies in this sainted group are BNSF, Iscar, Lubrizol and Marmon.\nOf the five, only MidAmerican, then earning $393 million pre-tax, was owned by Berkshire nine years\nago. Subsequently, we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth,BNSF, we paid about 70% of the cost in cash, and, for the remainder, issued shares that increased thenumber outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $10.4 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshireby the five companies over the nine-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfiesour goal of not simply growing, but rather increasing per-share results.\nIf the U.S. economy continues to improve in 2014, we can expect earnings of our Powerhouse Five toimprove also – perhaps by $1 billion or so pre-tax.\nŠOur many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $4.7 billion pre-tax last year, up from $3.9billion in 2012. Here, too, we expect further gains in 2014.\nŠBerkshire’s extensive insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2013 – that makes 11years in a row – and increased its float. During that 11-year stretch, our float – money that doesn’t belongto us but that we can invest for Berkshire’s benefit – has grown from $41 billion to $77 billion.Concurrently, our underwriting profit has aggregated $22 billion pre-tax, including $3 billion realized in2013. And all of this all began with our 1967 purchase of National Indemnity for $8.6 million .\nWe now own a wide variety of exceptional insurance operations. Best known is GEICO, the car insurerBerkshire acquired in full at yearend 1995 (having for many years prior owned a partial interest). GEICOin 1996 ranked number seven among U.S. auto insurers. Now, GEICO is number two, having recentlypassed Allstate. The reasons for this amazing growth are simple: low prices and reliable service. You cando yourself a favor by calling 1-800-847-7536 or checking Geico.com to see if you, too, can cut yourinsurance costs. Buy some of Berkshire’s other products with the savings.\n4\n\nŠWhile Charlie and I search for elephants, our many subsidiaries are regularly making bolt-on acquisitions.\nLast year, we contracted for 25 of these, scheduled to cost $3.1 billion in aggregate. These transactionsranged from $1.9 million to $1.1 billion in size.\nCharlie and I encourage these deals. They deploy capital in activities that fit with our existing businesses\nand that will be managed by our corps of expert managers. The result is no more work for us and moreearnings for you. Many more of these bolt-on deals will be made in future years. In aggregate, they will bemeaningful.\nŠLast year we invested $3.5 billion in the surest sort of bolt-on: the purchase of additional shares in twowonderful businesses that we already controlled. In one case – Marmon – our purchases brought us to the100% ownership we had signed up for in 2008. In the other instance – Iscar – the Wertheimer familyelected to exercise a put option it held, selling us the 20% of the business it retained when we boughtcontrol in 2006.\nThese purchases added about $300 million pre-tax to our current earning power and also delivered us $800\nmillion of cash. Meanwhile, the same nonsensical accounting rule that I described in last year’s letterrequired that we enter these purchases on our books at $1.8 billion less than we paid, a process thatreduced Berkshire’s book value. (The charge was made to “capital in excess of par value”; figure thatone\nout.) This weird accounting, you should understand, instantly increased Berkshire’s excess of intrinsicvalue over book value by the same $1.8 billion.\nŠOur subsidiaries spent a record $11 billion on plant and equipment during 2013, roughly twice ourdepreciation charge. About 89% of that money was spent in the United States. Though we invest abroad aswell, the mother lode of opportunity resides in America.\nŠIn a year in which most equity managers found it impossible to outperform the S&P 500, both ToddCombs and Ted Weschler handily did so. Each now runs a portfolio exceeding $7 billion. They’ve earnedit.\nI must again confess that their investments outperformed mine. (Charlie says I should add “by a lot.”) If\nsuch humiliating comparisons continue, I’ll have no choice but to cease talking about them.\nTodd and Ted have also created significant value for you in several matters unrelated to their portfolio\nactivities. Their contributions are just beginning: Both men have Berkshire blood in their veins.\nŠBerkshire’s yearend employment – counting Heinz – totaled a record 330,745, up 42,283 from last year.The increase, I must admit, included one person at our Omaha home office. (Don’t panic: Theheadquarters gang still fits comfortably on one floor.)\nŠBerkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its “Big Four” investments – AmericanExpress, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. We purchased additional shares of Wells Fargo (increasingour ownership to 9.2% versus 8.7% at yearend 2012) and IBM (6.3% versus 6.0%). Meanwhile, stockrepurchases at Coca-Cola and American Express raised our percentage ownership. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from 8.9% to 9.1% and our interest in American Express from 13.7% to 14.2%. And, if youthink tenths of a percent aren’t important, ponder this math: For the four companies in aggregate, eachincrease of one-tenth of a percent in our share of their equity raises Berkshire’s share of their annualearnings by $50 million.\n5\n\nThe four companies possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and\nshareholder-oriented. At Berkshire, we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of awonderful company to owning 100% of a so-so business; it’s better to have a partial interest in the Hopediamond than to own all of a rhinestone.\nGoing by our yearend holdings, our portion of the “Big Four’s” 2013 earnings amounted to $4.4 billion. In\nthe earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends we receive – about $1.4 billion lastyear. But make no mistake: The $3 billion of their earnings we don’t report is every bit as valuable to us asthe portion Berkshire records.\nThe earnings that these four companies retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock – a move\nthat enhances our share of future earnings – as well as for funding business opportunities that usually turnout to be advantageous. All that leads us to expect that the per-share earnings of these four investees willgrow substantially over time. If they do, dividends to Berkshire will increase and, even more important,our unrealized capital gains will, too. (For the four, unrealized gains already totaled $39 billion atyearend.)\nOur flexibility in capital allocation – our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlled\nbusinesses – gives us a significant advantage over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they canoperate. Woody Allen stated the general idea when he said: “The advantage of being bi-sexual is that itdoubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.” Similarly, our appetite for either operating businesses\nor passive investments doubles our chances of finding sensible uses for our endless gusher of cash.\n************\nLate in 2009, amidst the gloom of the Great Recession, we agreed to buy BNSF, the largest purchase in\nBerkshire’s history. At the time, I called the transaction an “all-in wager on the economic future of the UnitedStates.”\nThat kind of commitment was nothing new for us: We’ve been making similar wagers ever since Buffett\nPartnership Ltd. acquired control of Berkshire in 1965. For good reason, too. Charlie and I have always considereda “bet” on ever-rising U.S. prosperity to be very close to a sure thing.\nIndeed, who has ever benefited during the past 237 years by betting against America? If you compare our\ncountry’s present condition to that existing in 1776, you have to rub your eyes in wonder. And the dynamismembedded in our market economy will continue to work its magic. America’s best days lie ahead.\nWith this tailwind working for us, Charlie and I hope to build Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic value by\n(1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earningsthrough bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shareswhen they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and (5) making an occasional largeacquisition. We will also try to maximize results for youby rarely, if ever, issuing Berkshire shares.\nThose building blocks rest on a rock-solid foundation. A century hence, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy\nwill still be playing major roles in our economy. Insurance will concomitantly be essential for both businesses andindividuals – and no company brings greater human and financial resources to that business than Berkshire.\nMoreover, we will always maintain supreme financial strength, operating with at least $20 billion of cash\nequivalents and never incurring material amounts of short-term obligations. As we view these and other strengths,Charlie and I like your company’s prospects. We feel fortunate to be entrusted with its management.\n6\n\nIntrinsic Business Value\nAs much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that\nnumber is for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid outthe three elements – one of them qualitative – that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire’sintrinsic value. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 109 - 110.\nHere is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2013 our per-share investments increased 13.6% to\n$129,253 and our pre-tax earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments increased 12.8% to $9,116per share.\nSince 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 19.3% compounded annually, and our\nearnings figure has grown at a 20.6% clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the 43-yearperiod has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains inboth sectors, but we will most strongly focus on building operating earnings.\n************\nNow, let’s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and\nincome characteristics from the others. So we’ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie andI view them (though there are important and enduring advantages to having them all under one roof). Our goal is to\nprovide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you being thereporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (But don’t get any ideas!)\nInsurance\n“Our investment in the insurance companies reflects a first major step in our efforts to achieve a more\ndiversified base of earning power.”\n— 1967 Annual Report\nLet’s look first at insurance, Berkshire’s core operation and the engine that has consistently propelled our\nexpansion since that 1967 report was published.\nProperty-casualty (“P/C”) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such\nas those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go toothers. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their benefit. Though individual policies and claims comeand go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume.Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And howwe have grown, as the following table shows:\nYear\nFloat (in $ millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322013 77,240\nFurther gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO’s float will almost certainly grow.\nIn National Indemnity’s reinsurance division, however, we have a number of run-off contracts whose float driftsdownward. If we do experience a decline in float at some future time, it will be very gradual – at the outside no\nmore than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate\ndemands for sums that are large compared to our cash resources. (In this respect, property-casualty insurancediffers in an important way from certain forms of life insurance.)\n7\n\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of freemoney – and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous\nin most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in\neffect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State Farm, by far the country’s largest insurer and awell-managed company besides, incurred an underwriting loss in nine of the twelve years ending in 2012 (the latestyear for which their financials are available, as I write this). Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that theinsurance industry – despite the float income all companies enjoy – will continue its dismal record of earningsubnormal returns as compared to other businesses.\nAs noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for eleven\nconsecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $22 billion. Looking ahead, I believe we willcontinue to underwrite profitably in most years. Doing so is the daily focus of allof our insurance managers who\nknow that while float is valuable, it can be drowned by poor underwriting results.\nSo how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire’s book value is calculated, the fullamount of\nour float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think offloat as strictly a liability is incorrect; it should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims –some $17 billion to more than five million claimants in 2013 – and that reduces float. Just as surely, we each daywrite new business and thereby generate new claims that add to float. If our revolving float is both costless andlong-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this liability is dramatically less than the accounting\nliability.\nA counterpart to this overstated liability is $15.5 billion of “goodwill” that is attributable to our insurance\ncompanies and included in book value as an asset. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paid forthe float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing on\nits true value. For example, if an insurance business sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwillasset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\nFortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\ninsurance goodwill – what we would happily pay to purchase an insurance operation possessing float of similar\nquality to that we have – to be far in excess of its historic carrying value. The value of our float is one reason – a\nhuge reason – why we believe Berkshire’s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.\n************\nBerkshire’s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running\ndisciplined operations that possess strong, hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks\nthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks thatare inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are farmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large\ninsurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe – a loss about triple anything it has ever experienced – Berkshire as a whole would likely record asignificant profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings. And we would remain awash in cash,looking for large opportunities if the catastrophe caused markets to go into shock. All other major insurers andreinsurers would meanwhile be far in the red, with some facing insolvency.\nFrom a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $37 billion and a large\ncumulative underwriting profit, a feat no other insurance CEO has come close to matching. Ajit’s mind is an ideafactory that is always looking for more lines of business he can add to his current assortment.\n8\n\nOne venture materialized last June when he formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BHSI”).\nThis initiative took us into commercial insurance, where we were instantly accepted by both major insurancebrokers and corporate risk managers throughout America. These professionals recognize that no other insurer canmatch the financial strength of Berkshire, which guarantees that legitimate claims arising many years in the futurewill be paid promptly and fully.\nBHSI is led by Peter Eastwood, an experienced underwriter who is widely respected in the insurance\nworld. Peter has assembled a spectacular team that is already writing a substantial amount of business with manyFortune 500 companies and with smaller operations as well. BHSI will be a major asset for Berkshire, one that willgenerate volume in the billions within a few years. Give Peter a Berkshire greeting when you see him at the annualmeeting.\n************\nWe have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposureactually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit afterboth prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriatepremium can’t be obtained.\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can’t turn their back on business\nthat is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, “The other guy is doing it, so we must as well,”spells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.\nTad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re’s huge\nfloat has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue. We areparticularly enthusiastic about General Re’s international life reinsurance business, which has grown consistentlyand profitably since we acquired the company in 1998.\nIt can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, the company was beset by problems that\ncaused commentators – and me as well, briefly – to believe I had made a huge mistake. That day is long gone.General Re is now a gem.\n************\nFinally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 63 years ago. GEICO is managed by Tony\nNicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 52 years of service in 2013. Tony became CEO in 1993, andsince then the company has been flying.\nWhen I was first introduced to GEICO in January 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage the\ncompany enjoyed compared to the expenses borne by the giants of the industry. That operational efficiency continuestoday and is an all-important asset. No one likes to buy auto insurance. But almost everyone likes to drive. The\ninsurance needed is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them – and onlya low-cost operation can\ndeliver these.\nGEICO’s cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year after\nyear. Its low costs create a moat – an enduring one – that competitors are unable to cross. Meanwhile, our little\ngecko continues to tell Americans how GEICO can save them important money. With our latest reduction inoperating costs, his story has become even more compelling.\n9\n\nIn 1995, we purchased the half of GEICO that we didn’t already own, paying $1.4 billion more than the net\ntangible assets we acquired. That’s “goodwill,” and it will forever remain unchanged on our books. As GEICO’sbusiness grows, however, so does its trueeconomic goodwill. I believe that figure to be approaching $20 billion.\n************\nIn addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them\nplying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. In aggregate, these companies are a growing operation thatconsistently delivers an underwriting profit. Moreover, as the table below shows, they also provide us withsubstantial float. Charlie and I treasure these companies and their managers.\nUnderwriting Profit\nYearend Float\n(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2013 2012 2013 2012\nBH Reinsurance .............. $1,294 $ 304 $37,231 $34,821\nGeneral Re .................. 2 8 3 3 5 5 20,013 20,128\nGEICO ..................... 1,127 680 12,566 11,578\nOther Primary ................ 3 8 5 2 8 6 7,430 6,598\n$3,089 $1,625 $77,240 $73,125\n************\nSimply put, insurance is the sale of promises. The “customer” pays money now; the insurer promises to\npay money in the future if certain events occur.\nSometimes, the promise will not be tested for decades. (Think of life insurance bought by those in their\n20s.) Therefore, both the ability and willingness of the insurer to pay – even if economic chaos prevails whenpayment time arrives – is all-important.\nBerkshire’s promises have no equal, a fact affirmed in recent years by the actions of the world’s largest\nand most sophisticated insurers, some of which have wanted to shed themselves of huge and exceptionally long-lived liabilities, particularly those involving asbestos claims. That is, these insurers wished to “cede” their liabilitiesto a reinsurer. Choosing the wrong reinsurer, however – one that down the road proved to be financially strapped ora bad actor – would put the original insurer in danger of getting the liabilities right back in its lap.\nAlmost without exception, the largest insurers seeking aid came to Berkshire. Indeed, in the largest such\ntransaction ever recorded, Lloyd’s in 2007 turned over to us both many thousands of known claims arising frompolicies written before 1993 and an unknown but huge number of claims from that same period sure to materializein the future. (Yes, we will be receiving claims decades from now that apply to events taking place prior to 1993.)\nBerkshire’s ultimate payments arising from the Lloyd’s transaction are today unknowable. What is certain,\nhowever, is that Berkshire will pay all valid claims up to the $15 billion limit of our policy. No other insurer’spromise would have given Lloyd’s the comfort provided by its agreement with Berkshire. The CEO of the entitythen handling Lloyd’s claims said it best: “Names [the original insurers at Lloyd’s] wanted to sleep easy at night,and we think we’ve just bought them the world’s best mattress.”\n************\nBerkshire’s great managers, premier financial strength and a variety of business models possessing wide\nmoats form something unique in the insurance world. The combination is a huge asset for Berkshire shareholdersthat will only get more valuable with time.\n10\n\nRegulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\n“Though there are many regulatory restraints in the utility industry, it’s possible that we will make\nadditional commitments in the field. If we do, the amounts involved could be large.”\n— 1999 Annual Report\nWe have two major operations, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, that share important characteristics\ndistinguishing them from our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section in this letter andsplit out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.\nA key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, with\nthese partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact\nnot needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions will far exceedits interest requirements. Last year, for example, BNSF’s interest coverage was 9:1. (Our definition of coverage ispre-tax earnings/interest, notEBITDA/interest, a commonly-used measure we view as seriously flawed.)\nAt MidAmerican, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company’s ability to service its debt under all\ncircumstances. The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companiesexclusively offering an essential service. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great diversity of earningsstreams, which shield us from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body. Now, with the acquisition ofNV Energy, MidAmerican’s earnings base has further broadened. This particular strength, supplemented byBerkshire’s ownership, has enabled MidAmerican and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost ofdebt. This advantage benefits both us andour customers.\nEvery day, our two subsidiaries power the American economy in major ways:\nŠBNSF carries about 15% (measured by ton-miles) of allinter-city freight, whether it is transported by\ntruck, rail, water, air, or pipeline. Indeed, we move more ton-miles of goods than anyone else, a fact\nestablishing BNSF as the most important artery in our economy’s circulatory system. Its hold on thenumber-one position strengthened in 2013.\nBNSF, like all railroads, also moves its cargo in an extraordinarily fuel-efficient and environmentally\nfriendly way, carrying a ton of freight about 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. Trucks taking onthe same job guzzle about four times as much fuel.\nŠMidAmerican’s utilities serve regulated retail customers in eleven states. No utility company stretchesfurther. In addition, we are the leader in renewables: From a standing start nine years ago, MidAmericannow accounts for 7% of the country’s wind generation capacity, with more on the way. Our share insolar – most of which is still in construction – is even larger.\nMidAmerican can make these investments because it retains allof its earnings. Here’s a little known fact:\nLast year MidAmerican retained more dollars of earnings – by far – than any other American electricutility. We and our regulators see this as an important advantage – one almost certain to exist five, ten andtwenty years from now.\nWhen our current projects are completed, MidAmerican’s renewables portfolio will have cost $15 billion.\nWe relish making such commitments as long as they promise reasonable returns. And, on that front, we put a largeamount of trust in future regulation.\n11\n\nOur confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever\nneed massive investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capitalproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is meanwhile in our self-interest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.\nTangible proof of our dedication to that duty was delivered last year in a poll of customer satisfaction\ncovering 52 holding companies and their 101 operating electric utilities. Our MidAmerican group ranked numberone, with 95.3% of respondents giving us a “very satisfied” vote and not a single customer rating us “dissatisfied.”The bottom score in the survey, incidentally, was a dismal 34.5%.\nAll three of our companies were ranked far lower by this measure before they were acquired by\nMidAmerican. The extraordinary customer satisfaction we have achieved is of great importance as we expand:Regulators in states we hope to enter are glad to see us, knowing we will be responsible operators.\nOur railroad has been diligent as well in anticipating the needs of its customers. Whatever you may have\nheard about our country’s crumbling infrastructure in no way applies to BNSF or railroads generally. America’s railsystem has never been in better shape, a consequence of huge investments by the industry. We are not, however,resting: BNSF spent $4 billion on the railroad in 2013, double its depreciation charge and a single-year record foranyrailroad. And, we will spend considerably more in 2014. Like Noah, who foresaw early on the need for\ndependable transportation, we know it’s our job to plan ahead.\nLeading our two capital-intensive companies are Greg Abel, at MidAmerican, and the team of Matt Rose\nand Carl Ice at BNSF. The three are extraordinary managers who have my gratitude and deserve yours as well.Here are the key figures for their businesses:\nMidAmerican (89.8% owned)\nEarnings (in millions)\n2013 2012 2011\nU.K. utilities ........................................................ $ 3 6 2 $ 4 2 9 $ 4 6 9\nIowa utility ......................................................... 2 3 0 2 3 6 2 7 9\nWestern utilities ..................................................... 9 8 2 7 3 7 7 7 1\nPipelines ........................................................... 3 8 5 3 8 3 3 8 8\nHomeServices ....................................................... 1 3 9 8 2 3 9\nOther (net) ......................................................... 4 9 1 3 6\nOperating earnings before corporate interest and taxes ....................... 2,102 1,958 1,982\nInterest ............................................................ 2 9 6 3 1 4 3 3 6\nIncome taxes ........................................................ 1 7 0 1 7 2 3 1 5\nNet earnings ........................................................ $ 1,636 $ 1,472 $ 1,331\nEarnings applicable to Berkshire ........................................ $ 1,470 $ 1,323 $ 1,204\nBNSF Earnings (in millions)\n2013 2012 2011\nRevenues .......................................................... $22,014 $20,835 $19,548\nOperating expenses .................................................. 15,357 14,835 14,247\nOperating earnings before interest and taxes ............................... 6,657 6,000 5,301\nInterest (net) ........................................................ 7 2 9 6 2 3 5 6 0\nIncome taxes ........................................................ 2,135 2,005 1,769\nNet earnings ........................................................ $ 3,793 $ 3,372 $ 2,972\n12\n\nRon Peltier continues to build HomeServices, MidAmerican’s real estate brokerage subsidiary.

In contrast, the operating expense figures above are non-GAAP and exclude some purchase-accountingitems (primarily the amortization of certain intangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlieand I believe the adjusted numbers more accurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businessesaggregated in the table than do GAAP figures.\n13\n\nI won’t explain all of the adjustments – some are tiny and arcane – but serious investors should understand\nthe disparate nature of intangible assets: Some truly deplete over time while others in no way lose value. Withsoftware, for example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Charges against other intangibles such as theamortization of customer relationships, however, arise through purchase-accounting rules and are clearly not realcosts. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both, that is, are recorded as expenseswhen earnings are calculated – even though from an investor’s viewpoint they could not be more different.\nIn the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 29, amortization charges of $648 million for the\ncompanies included in this section are deducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these “real,” the rest not.This difference has become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. It will almost certainly risefurther as we acquire more companies.\nEventually, of course, the non-real charges disappear when the assets to which they’re related become\nfully amortized. But this usually takes 15 years and – alas – it will be my successor whose reported earnings get thebenefit of their expiration.\nEvery dime of depreciation expense we report, however, is a real cost. And that’s true at almost all other\ncompanies as well. When Wall Streeters tout EBITDA as a valuation guide, button your wallet.\nOur public reports of earnings will, of course, continue to conform to GAAP. To embrace reality,\nhowever, remember to add back most of the amortization charges we report.\n************\nThe crowd of companies in this section sells products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of\nthese businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets, enjoy terrific economics, producing\nprofits that run from 25% after-tax to far more than 100%. Others generate good returns in the area of 12% to 20%.A few, however, have very poor returns, a result of some serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation. Iwas not misled: I simply was wrong in my evaluation of the economic dynamics of the company or the industry inwhich it operated.\nFortunately, my blunders usually involved relatively small acquisitions. Our large buys have generally\nworked out well and, in a few cases, more than well. I have not, however, made my last mistake in purchasingeither businesses or stocks. Not everything works out as planned.\nViewed as a single entity, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employed an\naverage of $25 billion of net tangible assets during 2013 and, with large quantities of excess cash and littleleverage, earned 16.7% after-tax on that capital.\nOf course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if the purchase price is excessive.\nWe have paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in thelarge figure we show for goodwill. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we havedeployed in this sector. Furthermore, the intrinsic value of these businesses, in aggregate, exceeds their carryingvalue by a good margin. Even so, the difference between intrinsic value and carrying value in the insurance andregulated-industry segments is fargreater. It is there that the truly big winners reside.\n************\nWe have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, both current\nand potential competitors read this report. In a few of our businesses we might be disadvantaged if they knew ournumbers. So, in some of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of Berkshire, we onlydisclose what is required. You can find a good bit of detail about many of our operations, however, on pages 80-84.\n14\n\nI can’t resist, however, giving you an update on Nebraska Furniture Mart’s expansion into Texas. I’m not\ncovering this event because of its economic importance to Berkshire – it takes more than a new store to move the\nneedle on Berkshire’s $225 billion equity base. But I’ve now worked 30 years with the marvelous Blumkin family,and I’m excited about the remarkable store – truly Texas-sized – it is building at The Colony, in the northern part ofthe Dallas metropolitan area.\nWhen the store is completed next year, NFM will have – under one roof, and on a 433-acre site – 1.8 million\nsquare feet of retail and supporting warehouse space. View the project’s progress at www.nfm.com/texas. NFMalready owns the two highest-volume home furnishings stores in the country (in Omaha and Kansas City, Kansas),each doing about $450 million annually. I predict the Texas store will blow these records away. If you live anywherenear Dallas, come check us out.\nI think back to August 30, 1983 – my birthday – when I went to see Mrs. B (Rose Blumkin), carrying a\n1\n1⁄4-page purchase proposal for NFM that I had drafted. (It’s reproduced on pages 114 - 115.) Mrs. B accepted my\noffer without changing a word, and we completed the deal without the involvement of investment bankers orlawyers (an experience that can only be described as heavenly). Though the company’s financial statements wereunaudited, I had no worries. Mrs. B simply told me what was what, and her word was good enough for me.\nMrs. B was 89 at the time and worked until 103 – definitely my kind of woman. Take a look at NFM’s\nfinancial statements from 1946 on pages 116 - 117. Everything NFM now owns comes from (a) that $72,264 of networth and $50 – nozeros omitted – of cash the company then possessed, and (b) the incredible talents of Mrs. B,\nher son, Louie, and his sons Ron and Irv.\nThe punch line to this story is that Mrs. B never spent a day in school. Moreover, she emigrated from\nRussia to America knowing not a word of English. But she loved her adopted country: At Mrs. B’s request, thefamily always sang God Bless America at its gatherings.\nAspiring business managers should look hard at the plain, but rare, attributes that produced Mrs. B’s\nincredible success. Students from 40 universities visit me every year, and I have them start the day with a visit toNFM. If they absorb Mrs. B’s lessons, they need none from me.\nFinance and Financial Products\n“Clayton’s loan portfolio will likely grow to at least $5 billion in not too many years and, with sensible\ncredit standards in place, should deliver significant earnings.”\n— 2003 Annual Report\nThis sector, our smallest, includes two rental companies, XTRA (trailers) and CORT (furniture), as well as\nClayton Homes, the country’s leading producer and financer of manufactured homes. Aside from these 100%-owned subsidiaries, we also include in this category a collection of financial assets and our 50% interest inBerkadia Commercial Mortgage.\nClayton is placed in this section because it owns and services 326,569 mortgages, totaling $13.6 billion. In\nrecent years, as manufactured home sales plummeted, a high percentage of Clayton’s earnings came from thismortgage business.\nIn 2013, however, the sale of new homes began to pick up and earnings from both manufacturing and\nretailing are again becoming significant. Clayton remains America’s number one homebuilder: Its 2013 output of29,547 homes accounted for about 4.7% of all single-family residences built in the country. Kevin Clayton,Clayton’s CEO, has done a magnificent job of guiding the company through the severe housing depression. Now,his job – definitely more fun these days – includes the prospect of another earnings gain in 2014.\n15\n\nCORT and XTRA are leaders in their industries as well. And Jeff Pederson and Bill Franz will keep them\non top. We are backing their plans through purchases of equipment that enlarge their rental potential.\nHere’s the pre-tax earnings recap for this sector:\n2013 2012 2011\n(in millions)\nBerkadia ..................... $ 8 0 $ 3 5 $ 2 5\nClayton ...................... 4 1 6 2 5 5 1 5 4\nCORT ....................... 4 0 4 2 2 9\nXTRA ....................... 1 2 5 1 0 6 1 2 6\nNet financial income* ........... 3 2 4 4 1 0 4 4 0\n$985 $848 $ 774\n* Excludes capital gains or losses\nInvestments\n“Our stock portfolio . . . was worth approximately $17 million less than its carrying value [cost] . . .\nit is our belief that, over a period of years, the overall portfolio will prove to be worth more than itscost.”\n— 1974 Annual Report\nBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value.\n12/31/13\nShares**\nCompanyPercentage of\nCompany\nOwnedCost* Market\n(in millions)\n151,610,700 American Express Company ............. 14.2 $ 1,287 $ 13,756\n400,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company ............... 9 . 1 1,299 16,524\n22,238,900 DIRECTV ........................... 4 . 2 1,017 1,536\n41,129,643 Exxon Mobil Corp. .................... 0 . 9 3,737 4,162\n13,062,594 The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. .......... 2 . 8 7 5 0 2,315\n68,121,984 International Business Machines Corp. ..... 6 . 3 11,681 12,778\n24,669,778 Moody’s Corporation .................. 11.5 248 1,936\n20,060,390 Munich Re ........................... 11.2 2,990 4,415\n20,668,118 Phillips 66 ........................... 3 . 4 6 6 0 1,594\n52,477,678 The Procter & Gamble Company ......... 1 . 9 3 3 6 4,272\n22,169,930 Sanofi .............................. 1 . 7 1,747 2,354\n301,046,076 Tesco plc ............................ 3 . 7 1,699 1,666\n96,117,069 U.S. Bancorp ......................... 5 . 3 3,002 3,883\n56,805,984 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. .................. 1 . 8 2,976 4,470\n483,470,853 Wells Fargo & Company ................ 9 . 2 11,871 21,950\nOthers .............................. 11,281 19,894\nTotal Common Stocks Carried at Market . . . $56,581 $117,505\n*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP “cost” differs in a few cases because of\nwrite-ups or write-downs that have been required under its rules.\n**Excludes shares held by Berkshire subsidiary pension funds.\n16\n\nBerkshire has one major equity position that is not included in the table: We can buy 700 million shares of\nBank of America at any time prior to September 2021 for $5 billion. At yearend these shares were worth $10.9billion. We are likely to purchase the shares just before expiration of our option. In the meantime, it is important foryou to realize that Bank of America is, in effect, our fifth largest equity investment and one we value highly.\nIn addition to our equity holdings, we also invest substantial sums in bonds. Usually, we’ve done well in\nthese. But not always.\nMost of you have never heard of Energy Future Holdings. Consider yourselves lucky; I certainly wish I\nhadn’t. The company was formed in 2007 to effect a giant leveraged buyout of electric utility assets in Texas. Theequity owners put up $8 billion and borrowed a massive amount in addition. About $2 billion of the debt waspurchased by Berkshire, pursuant to a decision I made without consulting with Charlie. That was a bigmistake.\nUnless natural gas prices soar, EFH will almost certainly file for bankruptcy in 2014. Last year, we sold\nour holdings for $259 million. While owning the bonds, we received $837 million in cash interest. Overall,therefore, we suffered a pre-tax loss of $873 million. Next time I’ll call Charlie.\nA few of our subsidiaries – primarily electric and gas utilities – use derivatives in their operations.\nOtherwise, we have not entered into any derivative contracts for some years, and our existing positions continue torun off. The contracts that have expired have delivered large profits as well as several billion dollars of medium-term float. Though there are no guarantees, we expect a similar result from those remaining on our books.\nSome Thoughts About Investing\nInvestment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike.\n—The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham\nIt is fitting to have a Ben Graham quote open this discussion because I owe so much of what I know about\ninvesting to him. I will talk more about Ben a bit later, and I will even sooner talk about common stocks. But let mefirst tell you about two small non-stock investments that I made long ago. Though neither changed my net worth bymuch, they are instructive.\nThis tale begins in Nebraska. From 1973 to 1981, the Midwest experienced an explosion in farm prices,\ncaused by a widespread belief that runaway inflation was coming and fueled by the lending policies of small ruralbanks. Then the bubble burst, bringing price declines of 50% or more that devastated both leveraged farmers andtheir lenders. Five times as many Iowa and Nebraska banks failed in that bubble’s aftermath than in our recentGreat Recession.\nIn 1986, I purchased a 400-acre farm, located 50 miles north of Omaha, from the FDIC. It cost me\n$280,000, considerably less than what a failed bank had lent against the farm a few years earlier. I knew nothingabout operating a farm. But I have a son who loves farming and I learned from him both how many bushels of cornand soybeans the farm would produce and what the operating expenses would be. From these estimates, Icalculated the normalized return from the farm to then be about 10%. I also thought it was likely that productivitywould improve over time and that crop prices would move higher as well. Both expectations proved out.\nI needed no unusual knowledge or intelligence to conclude that the investment had no downside and\npotentially had substantial upside. There would, of course, be the occasional bad crop and prices would sometimesdisappoint. But so what? There would be some unusually good years as well, and I would never be under anypressure to sell the property. Now, 28 years later, the farm has tripled its earnings and is worth five times or morewhat I paid. I still know nothing about farming and recently made just my second visit to the farm.\n17\n\nIn 1993, I made another small investment. Larry Silverstein, Salomon’s landlord when I was the\ncompany’s CEO, told me about a New York retail property adjacent to NYU that the Resolution Trust Corp. wasselling. Again, a bubble had popped – this one involving commercial real estate – and the RTC had been created todispose of the assets of failed savings institutions whose optimistic lending practices had fueled the folly.\nHere, too, the analysis was simple. As had been the case with the farm, the unleveraged current yield from\nthe property was about 10%. But the property had been undermanaged by the RTC, and its income would increasewhen several vacant stores were leased. Even more important, the largest tenant – who occupied around 20% of theproject’s space – was paying rent of about $5 per foot, whereas other tenants averaged $70. The expiration of thisbargain lease in nine years was certain to provide a major boost to earnings. The property’s location was alsosuperb: NYU wasn’t going anywhere.\nI joined a small group, including Larry and my friend Fred Rose, that purchased the parcel. Fred was an\nexperienced, high-grade real estate investor who, with his family, would manage the property. And manage it theydid. As old leases expired, earnings tripled. Annual distributions now exceed 35% of our original equityinvestment. Moreover, our original mortgage was refinanced in 1996 and again in 1999, moves that allowed severalspecial distributions totaling more than 150% of what we had invested. I’ve yet to view the property.\nIncome from both the farm and the NYU real estate will probably increase in the decades to come. Though\nthe gains won’t be dramatic, the two investments will be solid and satisfactory holdings for my lifetime and,subsequently, for my children and grandchildren.\nI tell these tales to illustrate certain fundamentals of investing:\nŠYou don’t need to be an expert in order to achieve satisfactory investment returns. But if you aren’t, you\nmust recognize your limitations and follow a course certain to work reasonably well. Keep things simpleand don’t swing for the fences. When promised quick profits, respond with a quick “no.”\nŠFocus on the future productivity of the asset you are considering. If you don’t feel comfortable making a roughestimate of the asset’s future earnings, just forget it and move on. No one has the ability to evaluate everyinvestment possibility. But omniscience isn’t necessary; you only need to understand the actions you undertake.\nŠIf you instead focus on the prospective price change of a contemplated purchase, you are speculating.There is nothing improper about that. I know, however, that I am unable to speculate successfully, and Iam skeptical of those who claim sustained success at doing so. Half of all coin-flippers will win their firsttoss; none of those winners has an expectation of profit if he continues to play the game. And the fact that\na given asset has appreciated in the recent past is never a reason to buy it.\nŠWith my two small investments, I thought only of what the properties would produce and cared not at all\nabout their daily valuations. Games are won by players who focus on the playing field – not by thosewhose eyes are glued to the scoreboard. If you can enjoy Saturdays and Sundays without looking at stockprices, give it a try on weekdays.\nŠForming macro opinions or listening to the macro or market predictions of others is a waste of time.Indeed, it is dangerous because it may blur your vision of the facts that are truly important. (When I hearTV commentators glibly opine on what the market will do next, I am reminded of Mickey Mantle’sscathing comment: “You don’t know how easy this game is until you get into that broadcasting booth.”)\n18\n\nŠMy two purchases were made in 1986 and 1993. What the economy, interest rates, or the stock market\nmight do in the years immediately following – 1987 and 1994 – was of no importance to me in makingthose investments. I can’t remember what the headlines or pundits were saying at the time. Whatever thechatter, corn would keep growing in Nebraska and students would flock to NYU.\nThere is one major difference between my two small investments and an investment in stocks. Stocks\nprovide you minute-to-minute valuations for your holdings whereas I have yet to see a quotation for either my farmor the New York real estate.\nIt should be an enormous advantage for investors in stocks to have those wildly fluctuating valuations\nplaced on their holdings – and for some investors, it is. After all, if a moody fellow with a farm bordering myproperty yelled out a price every day to me at which he would either buy my farm or sell me his – and those pricesvaried widely over short periods of time depending on his mental state – how in the world could I be other thanbenefited by his erratic behavior? If his daily shout-out was ridiculously low, and I had some spare cash, I wouldbuy his farm. If the number he yelled was absurdly high, I could either sell to him or just go on farming.\nOwners of stocks, however, too often let the capricious and often irrational behavior of their fellow owners\ncause them to behave irrationally as well. Because there is so much chatter about markets, the economy, interestrates, price behavior of stocks, etc., some investors believe it is important to listen to pundits – and, worse yet,important to consider acting upon their comments.\nThose people who can sit quietly for decades when they own a farm or apartment house too often become\nfrenetic when they are exposed to a stream of stock quotations and accompanying commentators delivering animplied message of “Don’t just sit there, dosomething.” For these investors, liquidity is transformed from the\nunqualified benefit it should be to a curse.\nA “flash crash” or some other extreme market fluctuation can’t hurt an investor any more than an erratic\nand mouthy neighbor can hurt my farm investment. Indeed, tumbling markets can be helpful to the true investor ifhe has cash available when prices get far out of line with values. A climate of fear is your friend when investing; a\neuphoric world is your enemy.\nDuring the extraordinary financial panic that occurred late in 2008, I never gave a thought to selling my\nfarm or New York real estate, even though a severe recession was clearly brewing. And, if I had owned 100% of asolid business with good long-term prospects, it would have been foolish for me to even consider dumping it. Sowhy would I have sold my stocks that were small participations in wonderful businesses? True, any one of themmight eventually disappoint, but as a group they were certain to do well. Could anyone really believe the earth wasgoing to swallow up the incredible productive assets and unlimited human ingenuity existing in America?\n************\nWhen Charlie and I buy stocks – which we think of as small portions of businesses – our analysis is very\nsimilar to that which we use in buying entire businesses. We first have to decide whether we can sensibly estimatean earnings range for five years out, or more. If the answer is yes, we will buy the stock (or business) if it sells at areasonable price in relation to the bottom boundary of our estimate. If, however, we lack the ability to estimatefuture earnings – which is usually the case – we simply move on to other prospects. In the 54 years we have workedtogether, we have never foregone an attractive purchase because of the macro or political environment, or the views\nof other people. In fact, these subjects never come up when we make decisions.\nIt’s vital, however, that we recognize the perimeter of our “circle of competence” and stay well inside of\nit. Even then, we will make some mistakes, both with stocks and businesses. But they will not be the disasters thatoccur, for example, when a long-rising market induces purchases that are based on anticipated price behavior and adesire to be where the action is.\n19\n\nMost investors, of course, have not made the study of business prospects a priority in their lives. If wise,\nthey will conclude that they do not know enough about specific businesses to predict their future earning power.\nI have good news for these non-professionals: The typical investor doesn’t need this skill. In aggregate,\nAmerican business has done wonderfully over time and will continue to do so (though, most assuredly, inunpredictable fits and starts). In the 20\nthCentury, the Dow Jones Industrials index advanced from 66 to 11,497,\npaying a rising stream of dividends to boot. The 21stCentury will witness further gains, almost certain to be\nsubstantial. The goal of the non-professional should not be to pick winners – neither he nor his “helpers” can dothat – but should rather be to own a cross-section of businesses that in aggregate are bound to do well. A low-costS&P 500 index fund will achieve this goal.\nThat’s the “what” of investing for the non-professional. The “when” is also important. The main danger is\nthat the timid or beginning investor will enter the market at a time of extreme exuberance and then becomedisillusioned when paper losses occur. (Remember the late Barton Biggs’ observation: “A bull market is like sex. Itfeels best just before it ends.”) The antidote to that kind of mistiming is for an investor to accumulate shares over along period and never to sell when the news is bad and stocks are well off their highs. Following those rules, the“know-nothing” investor who both diversifies and keeps his costs minimal is virtually certain to get satisfactory\nresults. Indeed, the unsophisticated investor who is realistic about his shortcomings is likely to obtain better long-term results than the knowledgeable professional who is blind to even a single weakness.\nIf “investors” frenetically bought and sold farmland to each other, neither the yields nor prices of their\ncrops would be increased. The only consequence of such behavior would be decreases in the overall earningsrealized by the farm-owning population because of the substantial costs it would incur as it sought advice andswitched properties.\nNevertheless, both individuals and institutions will constantly be urged to be active by those who profit\nfrom giving advice or effecting transactions. The resulting frictional costs can be huge and, for investors inaggregate, devoid of benefit. So ignore the chatter, keep your costs minimal, and invest in stocks as you would in afarm.\nMy money, I should add, is where my mouth is: What I advise here is essentially identical to certain\ninstructions I’ve laid out in my will. One bequest provides that cash will be delivered to a trustee for my wife’sbenefit. (I have to use cash for individual bequests, because allof my Berkshire shares will be fully distributed to\ncertain philanthropic organizations over the ten years following the closing of my estate.) My advice to the trusteecould not be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard’s.) I believe the trust’s long-term results from this policy will be superior tothose attained by most investors – whether pension funds, institutions or individuals – who employ high-feemanagers.\n************\nAnd now back to Ben Graham. I learned most of the thoughts in this investment discussion from Ben’s\nbook The Intelligent Investor , which I bought in 1949. My financial life changed with that purchase.\nBefore reading Ben’s book, I had wandered around the investing landscape, devouring everything written\non the subject. Much of what I read fascinated me: I tried my hand at charting and at using market indicia to predictstock movements. I sat in brokerage offices watching the tape roll by, and I listened to commentators. All of thiswas fun, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t getting anywhere.\nIn contrast, Ben’s ideas were explained logically in elegant, easy-to-understand prose (without Greek\nletters or complicated formulas). For me, the key points were laid out in what later editions labeled Chapters 8 and20. (The original 1949 edition numbered its chapters differently.) These points guide my investing decisions today.\n20\n\nA couple of interesting sidelights about the book: Later editions included a postscript describing an\nunnamed investment that was a bonanza for Ben. Ben made the purchase in 1948 when he was writing the firstedition and – brace yourself – the mystery company was GEICO. If Ben had not recognized the special qualities ofGEICO when it was still in its infancy, my future and Berkshire’s would have been far different.\nThe 1949 edition of the book also recommended a railroad stock that was then selling for $17 and earning\nabout $10 per share. (One of the reasons I admired Ben was that he had the guts to use current examples, leavinghimself open to sneers if he stumbled.) In part, that low valuation resulted from an accounting rule of the time thatrequired the railroad to exclude from its reported earnings the substantial retained earnings of affiliates.\nThe recommended stock was Northern Pacific, and its most important affiliate was Chicago, Burlington\nand Quincy. These railroads are now important parts of BNSF (Burlington Northern Santa Fe), which is today fullyowned by Berkshire. When I read the book, Northern Pacific had a market value of about $40 million. Now itssuccessor (having added a great many properties, to be sure) earns that amount every four days.\nI can’t remember what I paid for that first copy of The Intelligent Investor . Whatever the cost, it would\nunderscore the truth of Ben’s adage: Price is what you pay, value is what you get. Of all the investments I evermade, buying Ben’s book was the best (except for my purchase of two marriage licenses).\n************\nLocal and state financial problems are accelerating, in large part because public entities promised pensions\nthey couldn’t afford. Citizens and public officials typically under-appreciated the gigantic financial tapeworm thatwas born when promises were made that conflicted with a willingness to fund them. Unfortunately, pensionmathematics today remain a mystery to most Americans.\nInvestment policies, as well, play an important role in these problems. In 1975, I wrote a memo to\nKatharine Graham, then chairman of The Washington Post Company, about the pitfalls of pension promises and theimportance of investment policy. That memo is reproduced on pages 118 - 136.\nDuring the next decade, you will read a lot of news – badnews – about public pension plans. I hope my\nmemo is helpful to you in understanding the necessity for prompt remedial action where problems exist.\nThe Annual Meeting\nThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 3\nrdat the CenturyLink Center. Carrie Sova, our talented\nringmaster, will be in charge, and all of our headquarters group will pitch in to help her. Our gang both does abetter job than professional event planners would and – yes – saves us money.\nCenturyLink’s doors will open at 7 a.m., and at 7:30 we will have our third International Newspaper\nTossing Challenge. Our target will be a Clayton Home porch, precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. I tossedabout 500,000 papers when I was a teenager, so I think I’m pretty good. Challenge me: I’ll buy a Dilly Bar foranyone who lands his or her throw closer to the doorstep than I do. The papers will be 36 to 42 pages, and you mustfold them yourself (no rubber bands allowed).\nAt 8:30, a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answer\nperiod, which (with a break for lunch at CenturyLink’s stands) will last until 3:30. After a short recess, Charlie andI will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decide to leave during the day’s question periods, please do sowhile Charlie is talking.\n21\n\nThe best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We’ll assist you by filling the 194,300-square-foot hall that\nadjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you did your part, andmost locations racked up record sales. In a nine-hour period, we sold 1,062 pairs of Justin boots (that’s a pair every32 seconds), 12,792 pounds of See’s candy, 11,162 Quikut knives (21 knives per minute) and 6,344 pairs of WellsLamont gloves, always a hot item. This year, Charlie and I will have competing ketchup bottles for sale. Naturally,the one with Charlie’s picture will be heavily discounted. But, if you help, my bottle will outsell his. This isimportant, so don’t let me down.\nBrooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at the meeting.\nAfter you purchase a pair, wear them the next day at our second annual “Berkshire 5K,” an 8 a.m. race starting atthe CenturyLink. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor’s Guide that you will receive withyour tickets for the meeting. Entrants will find themselves running alongside many of Berkshire’s managers,directors and associates.\nGEICO will have a booth in the shopping area, staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the\ncountry. Stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount (usually 8%).This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental point: Thediscount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that given certain groups.) Bring the details of yourexisting insurance and check out whether we can save you money. For at least half of you, I believe we can.\nBe sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry about 35 books and DVDs, among them a couple of new\ntitles. One is Max Olson’s compilation of Berkshire letters going back to 1965. The book includes an index that Ifind particularly useful, specifying page numbers for individuals, companies and subject matter. I also recommendForty Chances by my son, Howard. You’ll enjoy it.\nIf you are a big spender – or aspire to become one – visit Signature Flight Support on the east side of the\nOmaha airport between noon and 5 p.m. on Saturday. There, we will have a fleet of NetJets aircraft sure to set yourpulse racing. Come by bus; leave by private jet. Live a little.\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. Airlines have sometimes jacked up pricesfor the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City versusOmaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2\n1⁄2hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you\nsignificant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. Spend the savings with us.\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72ndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we will\nagain be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. Last year in the week surrounding the meeting, the storedid $40.2 million of business, breaking its previous record by 12%. It also set a single day record of $8.2 million onSaturday, selling nearly $1 million of mattresses alone.\nTo obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, April 29\nthand\nMonday, May 5thinclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even apply\nto the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting butwhich, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation.NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. On Saturday thisyear, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a picnic to which you are all invited.\nAt Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from\n6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 2\nnd. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 4th, from 9 a.m. to 4\np.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. In recent years, our three-day volume has far exceeded sales in allof December, normally a jeweler’s best month.\n22\n\nAbout 1:15 p.m. on Sunday, I will begin clerking at Borsheims. Ask for my “Crazy Warren” quote on the\nitem of your choice. As I get older, my pricing gets ever more ridiculous. Come take advantage of me.\nWe will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 28ththrough Saturday, May 10th. During that period,\nplease identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement thatshows you are a Berkshire holder.\nOn Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion,\nwill take on all comers – who will have their eyes wide open – in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, aremarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and SharonOsberg, two of the world’s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon.Don’t play them for money.\nMy friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. Last\nyear, she made Americans – and especially me – proud with her performance at the Olympics.\nI met Ariel when she was nine and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Now, she’s a\nfreshman at Princeton and the U.S. Women’s Champion. If you don’t mind embarrassing yourself, test your skillsagainst her, beginning at 1 p.m. Bill Gates and I will lead off and try to soften her up.\nGorat’s and Piccolo’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 4\nth. Both\nwill be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat’s opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo’s opening at 4 p.m. These restaurants aremy favorites, and I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening. Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call402-551-3733 on April 1\nst(but not before ) and for Piccolo’s call 402-342-9038. At Piccolo’s order a giant root beer\nfloat for dessert. Only sissies get the small one.\nWe will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the\nmeeting, asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists andtheir e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be e-mailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com; BeckyQuick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, atarsorkin@nytimes.com.\nFrom the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most interesting\nand important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you keep itconcise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than two questions inany e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if yourquestion is selected.)\nWe will also have a panel of three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the insurance specialist will\nbe Jay Gelb of Barclays. Questions that deal with our non-insurance operations will come from Jonathan Brandt ofRuane, Cunniff & Goldfarb.\nAnd we will again have a credentialed bear on Berkshire. We would like to hear from applicants who are\nshort Berkshire (please include evidence of your position). The three analysts will bring their own Berkshire-specific questions and alternate with the journalists and the audience in asking them.\nCharlie and I believe that all shareholders should have access to new Berkshire information\nsimultaneously and should also have adequate time to analyze it. That’s why we try to issue financial informationlate on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is held on Saturdays. We do not talk one-on-oneto large institutional investors or analysts, but rather treat allshareholders the same. Our hope is that the journalists\nand analysts will ask questions that further educate our owners about their investment.\n23\n\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the journalists\nand analysts will come up with some tough ones, and that’s the way we like it. All told, we expect at least54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and 18 from the audience. If there is someextra time, we will take more from the audience. Audience questioners will be determined by drawings that willtake place at 8:15 a.m. at each of the 15 microphones located in the arena and main overflow room.\n************\nFor good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-\nStars, who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I believe the mindset of ourmanagers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Mosthave no financial need to work; the joy of hitting business “home runs” means as much to them as their paycheck.\nEqually important, however, are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office. This\ngroup efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 23,000-page Federalincome tax return as well as state and foreign returns, responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries, getsout the annual report, prepares for the country’s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board’s activities – and thelist goes on and on.\nThey handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy\nand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year they dealt with the 40universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They also handleall kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and French fries (smothered inketchup, of course) for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly do feel like tap dancing to work every day.\nIn closing, I think it’s become appropriate to ignore our “no pictures” policy and let you view our\nremarkable home-office crew. Below is a photo from our Christmas lunch. Two people couldn’t make it; otherwiseyou are looking at all of those who staff Berkshire’s headquarters. They are truly miracle-workers.\nNext year’s letter will review our 50 years at Berkshire and speculate a bit about the next 50. In the\nmeantime, come to Omaha on May 3\nrdand enjoy our Woodstock for Capitalists.\nFebruary 28, 2014\nWarren E. BuffettChairman of the Board\nA power lunch, Berkshire-style\n24",

Starting in 1979,\naccounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market rather than at the lower of cost or market, which waspreviously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire’s results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects ,\nthe results are calculated using the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax .I fa\ncorporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return. Over theyears, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n2\n\nA note to readers: Fifty years ago, today’s management took charge at Berkshire. For this Golden Anniversary,\nWarren Buffett and Charlie Munger each wrote his views of what has happened at Berkshire during the past 50years and what each expects during the next 50. Neither changed a word of his commentary after reading what theother had written. Warren’s thoughts begin on page 24 and Charlie’s on page 39. Shareholders, particularly newones, may find it useful to read those letters before reading the report on 2014, which begins below.\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshire’s gain in net worth during 2014 was $18.3 billion, which increased the per-share book value of\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 8.3%. Over the last 50 years (that is, since present management took over),per-share book value has grown from $19 to $146,186, a rate of 19.4% compounded annually.*\nDuring our tenure, we have consistently compared the yearly performance of the S&P 500 to the change in\nBerkshire’s per-share book value. We’ve done that because book value has been a crude, but useful, tracking device\nfor the number that really counts: intrinsic business value.\nIn our early decades, the relationship between book value and intrinsic value was much closer than it is\nnow. That was true because Berkshire’s assets were then largely securities whose values were continuously restatedto reflect their current market prices. In Wall Street parlance, most of the assets involved in the calculation of bookvalue were “marked to market.”\nToday, our emphasis has shifted in a major way to owning and operating large businesses. Many of these\nare worth far more than their cost-based carrying value. But that amount is never revalued upward no matter how\nmuch the value of these companies has increased. Consequently, the gap between Berkshire’s intrinsic value and itsbook value has materially widened.\nWith that in mind, we have added a new set of data – the historical record of Berkshire’s stock price – to\nthe performance table on the facing page. Market prices, let me stress, have their limitations in the short term.Monthly or yearly movements of stocks are often erratic and not indicative of changes in intrinsic value. Over time,however, stock prices and intrinsic value almost invariably converge. Charlie Munger, Berkshire Vice Chairmanand my partner, and I believe that has been true at Berkshire: In our view, the increase in Berkshire’s per-shareintrinsic value over the past 50 years is roughly equal to the 1,826,163% gain in market price of the company’sshares.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500thof\nthose shown for A.\n3\n\nThe Year at Berkshire\nIt was a good year for Berkshire on all major fronts, except one. Here are the important developments:\n‹Our “Powerhouse Five” – a collection of Berkshire’s largest non-insurance businesses – had a record $12.4\nbillion of pre-tax earnings in 2014, up $1.6 billion from 2013.* The companies in this sainted group areBerkshire Hathaway Energy (formerly MidAmerican Energy), BNSF, IMC (I’ve called it Iscar in the past),Lubrizol and Marmon.\nOf the five, only Berkshire Hathaway Energy, then earning $393 million, was owned by us a decade ago.\nSubsequently we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth, BNSF, wepaid about 70% of the cost in cash and, for the remainder, issued Berkshire shares that increased thenumber outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $12 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshire bythe five companies over the ten-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfies ourgoal of not simply increasing earnings, but making sure we also increase per-share results.\nIf the U.S. economy continues to improve in 2015, we expect earnings of our Powerhouse Five to improve\nas well. The gain could reach $1 billion, in part because of bolt-on acquisitions by the group that havealready closed or are under contract.\n‹Our bad news from 2014 comes from our group of five as well and is unrelated to earnings. During theyear, BNSF disappointed many of its customers. These shippers depend on us, and service failures canbadly hurt their businesses.\nBNSF is, by far, Berkshire’s most important non-insurance subsidiary and, to improve its performance, we\nwill spend $6 billion on plant and equipment in 2015. That sum is nearly 50% more than any other railroadhas spent in a single year and is a truly extraordinary amount, whether compared to revenues, earnings ordepreciation charges.\nThough weather, which was particularly severe last year, will always cause railroads a variety of operating\nproblems, our responsibility is to do whatever it takes to restore our service to industry-leading levels. That\ncan’t be done overnight: The extensive work required to increase system capacity sometimes disruptsoperations while it is underway. Recently, however, our outsized expenditures are beginning to showresults. During the last three months, BNSF’s performance metrics have materially improved from lastyear’s figures.\n‹Our many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $5.1 billion last year, up from $4.7 billion in2013. Here, as with our Powerhouse Five, we expect further gains in 2015. Within this group, we have twocompanies that last year earned between $400 million and $600 million, six that earned between $250million and $400 million, and seven that earned between $100 million and $250 million. This collection ofbusinesses will increase in both number and earnings. Our ambitions have no finish line.\n‹Berkshire’s huge and growing insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2014 – thatmakes 12 years in a row – and increased its float. During that 12-year stretch, our float – money thatdoesn’t belong to us but that we can invest for Berkshire’s benefit – has grown from $41 billion to $84billion. Though neither that gain nor the size of our float is reflected in Berkshire’s earnings, floatgenerates significant investment income because of the assets it allows us to hold.\n* Throughout this letter, as well as in the “Golden Anniversary” letters included later in this report, all earnings are\nstated on a pre-tax basis unless otherwise designated.\n4\n\nMeanwhile, our underwriting profit totaled $24 billion during the twelve-year period, including $2.7 billion\nearned in 2014. And all of this began with our 1967 purchase of National Indemnity for $8.6 million .\n‹While Charlie and I search for new businesses to buy, our many subsidiaries are regularly making bolt-on\nacquisitions. Last year was particularly fruitful: We contracted for 31 bolt-ons, scheduled to cost $7.8billion in aggregate. The size of these transactions ranged from $400,000 to $2.9 billion. However, thelargest acquisition, Duracell, will not close until the second half of this year. It will then be placed underMarmon’s jurisdiction.\nCharlie and I encourage bolt-ons, ifthey are sensibly-priced. (Most deals offered us aren’t.) They deploy\ncapital in activities that fit with our existing businesses and that will be managed by our corps of expertmanagers. This means no more work for us, yet more earnings, a combination we find particularlyappealing. We will make many more of these bolt-on deals in future years.\n‹Two years ago my friend, Jorge Paulo Lemann, asked Berkshire to join his 3G Capital group in theacquisition of Heinz. My affirmative response was a no-brainer: I knew immediately that this partnershipwould work well from both a personal and financial standpoint. And it most definitely has.\nI’m not embarrassed to admit that Heinz is run far better under Alex Behring, Chairman, and Bernardo\nHees, CEO, than would be the case if I were in charge. They hold themselves to extraordinarily highperformance standards and are never satisfied, even when their results far exceed those of competitors.\nWe expect to partner with 3G in more activities. Sometimes our participation will only involve a financing\nrole, as was the case in the recent acquisition of Tim Hortons by Burger King. Our favored arrangement,however, will usually be to link up as a permanent equity partner (who, in some cases, contributes to the\nfinancing of the deal as well). Whatever the structure, we feel good when working with Jorge Paulo.\nBerkshire also has fine partnerships with Mars and Leucadia, and we may form new ones with them or with\nother partners. Our participation in any joint activities, whether as a financing or equity partner, will belimited to friendly transactions.\n‹In October, we contracted to buy Van Tuyl Automotive, a group of 78 automobile dealerships that isexceptionally well-run. Larry Van Tuyl, the company’s owner, and I met some years ago. He then decidedthat if he were ever to sell his company, its home should be Berkshire. Our purchase was recentlycompleted, and we are now “car guys.”\nLarry and his dad, Cecil, spent 62 years building the group, following a strategy that made owner-partners\nof all local managers. Creating this mutuality of interests proved over and over to be a winner. Van Tuyl isnow the fifth-largest automotive group in the country, with per-dealership sales figures that areoutstanding.\nIn recent years, Jeff Rachor has worked alongside Larry, a successful arrangement that will continue. There\nare about 17,000 dealerships in the country, and ownership transfers always require approval by therelevant auto manufacturer. Berkshire’s job is to perform in a manner that will cause manufacturers towelcome further purchases by us. If we do this – and if we can buy dealerships at sensible prices – we willbuild a business that before long will be multiples the size of Van Tuyl’s $9 billion of sales.\nWith the acquisition of Van Tuyl, Berkshire now owns 9\n1⁄2companies that would be listed on the Fortune\n500 were they independent (Heinz is the1⁄2). That leaves 4901⁄2fish in the sea. Our lines are out.\n5\n\n‹Our subsidiaries spent a record $15 billion on plant and equipment during 2014, well over twice their\ndepreciation charges. About 90% of that money was spent in the United States. Though we will alwaysinvest abroad as well, the mother lode of opportunities runs through America. The treasures that have beenuncovered up to now are dwarfed by those still untapped. Through dumb luck, Charlie and I were born inthe United States, and we are forever grateful for the staggering advantages this accident of birth has givenus.\n‹Berkshire’s yearend employees – including those at Heinz – totaled a record 340,499, up 9,754 from lastyear. The increase, I am proud to say, included no gain at headquarters (where 25 people work). No sensegoing crazy.\n‹Berkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its “Big Four” investments – AmericanExpress, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. We purchased additional shares of IBM (increasing ourownership to 7.8% versus 6.3% at yearend 2013). Meanwhile, stock repurchases at Coca-Cola, AmericanExpress and Wells Fargo raised our percentage ownership of each. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from9.1% to 9.2%, our interest in American Express increased from 14.2% to 14.8% and our ownership ofWells Fargo grew from 9.2% to 9.4%. And, if you think tenths of a percent aren’t important, ponder thismath: For the four companies in aggregate, each increase of one-tenth of a percent in our ownership raisesBerkshire’s portion of their annual earnings by $50 million.\nThese four investees possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and\nshareholder-oriented. At Berkshire, we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of awonderful company to owning 100% of a so-so business. It’s better to have a partial interest in the HopeDiamond than to own all of a rhinestone.\nIf Berkshire’s yearend holdings are used as the marker, our portion of the “Big Four’s” 2014 earnings\nbefore discontinued operations amounted to $4.7 billion (compared to $3.3 billion only three years ago). Inthe earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends we receive – about $1.6 billion lastyear. (Again, three years ago the dividends were $862 million.) But make no mistake: The $3.1 billion ofthese companies’ earnings we don’t report are every bit as valuable to us as the portion Berkshire records.\nThe earnings these investees retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock – a move that\nenhances Berkshire’s share of future earnings without requiring us to lay out a dime. Their retainedearnings also fund business opportunities that usually turn out to be advantageous. All that leads us toexpect that the per-share earnings of these four investees, in aggregate, will grow substantially over time(though 2015 will be a tough year for the group, in part because of the strong dollar). If the expected gainsmaterialize, dividends to Berkshire will increase and, even more important, so will our unrealized capitalgains. (For the package of four, our unrealized gains already totaled $42 billion at yearend.)\nOur flexibility in capital allocation – our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlled\nbusinesses – gives us a significant advantage over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they canoperate. Our appetite for either operating businesses or passive investments doubles our chances of finding\nsensible uses for Berkshire’s endless gusher of cash.\n‹I’ve mentioned in the past that my experience in business helps me as an investor and that my investmentexperience has made me a better businessman. Each pursuit teaches lessons that are applicable to the other.And some truths can only be fully learned through experience. (In Fred Schwed’s wonderful book, Where\nAre the Customers’ Yachts? , a Peter Arno cartoon depicts a puzzled Adam looking at an eager Eve, while a\ncaption says, “There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin either by words orpictures.” If you haven’t read Schwed’s book, buy a copy at our annual meeting. Its wisdom and humor aretruly priceless.)\n6\n\nAmong Arno’s “certain things,” I would include two separate skills, the evaluation of investments and the\nmanagement of businesses. I therefore think it’s worthwhile for Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, our twoinvestment managers, to each have oversight of at least one of our businesses. A sensible opportunity forthem to do so opened up a few months ago when we agreed to purchase two companies that, thoughsmaller than we would normally acquire, have excellent economic characteristics. Combined, the two earn$100 million annually on about $125 million of net tangible assets.\nI’ve asked Todd and Ted to each take on one as Chairman, in which role they will function in the very\nlimited way that I do with our larger subsidiaries. This arrangement will save me a minor amount of workand, more important, make the two of them even better investors than they already are (which is to sayamong the best).\n************\nLate in 2009, amidst the gloom of the Great Recession, we agreed to buy BNSF, the largest purchase in\nBerkshire’s history. At the time, I called the transaction an “all-in wager on the economic future of the UnitedStates.”\nThat kind of commitment was nothing new for us. We’ve been making similar wagers ever since Buffett\nPartnership Ltd. acquired control of Berkshire in 1965. For good reason, too: Charlie and I have always considered a“bet” on ever-rising U.S. prosperity to be very close to a sure thing.\nIndeed, who has ever benefited during the past 238 years by betting against America? If you compare our\ncountry’s present condition to that existing in 1776, you have to rub your eyes in wonder. In my lifetime alone, real\nper-capita U.S. output has sextupled . My parents could not have dreamed in 1930 of the world their son would see.\nThough the preachers of pessimism prattle endlessly about America’s problems, I’ve never seen one who wishes toemigrate (though I can think of a few for whom I would happily buy a one-way ticket).\nThe dynamism embedded in our market economy will continue to work its magic. Gains won’t come in a\nsmooth or uninterrupted manner; they never have. And we will regularly grumble about our government. But, mostassuredly, America’s best days lie ahead.\nWith this tailwind working for us, Charlie and I hope to build Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic value by\n(1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earningsthrough bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shareswhen they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and (5) making an occasional largeacquisition. We will also try to maximize results for youby rarely, if ever, issuing Berkshire shares.\nThose building blocks rest on a rock-solid foundation. A century hence, BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway\nEnergy will still be playing vital roles in our economy. Homes and autos will remain central to the lives of mostfamilies. Insurance will continue to be essential for both businesses and individuals. Looking ahead, Charlie and Isee a world made to order for Berkshire. We feel fortunate to be entrusted with its management.\nIntrinsic Business Value\nAs much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that\nnumber is for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid out thethree elements – one of them qualitative – that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire’s intrinsicvalue. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 123-124.\nHere is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2014 our per-share investments increased 8.4% to\n$140,123, and our earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments increased 19% to $10,847 pershare.\n7\n\nSince 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 19% compounded annually, and our\nearnings figure has grown at a 20.6% clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the ensuing 44years has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains in bothsectors, but our main focus is to build operating earnings. That’s why we were pleased to exchange our Phillips 66and Graham Holdings stock for operating businesses last year and to contract with Procter and Gamble to acquireDuracell by means of a similar exchange set to close in 2015.\n************\nNow, let’s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and\nincome characteristics from the others. So we’ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie andI view them (though there are important and enduring advantages to having them all under one roof). Our goal is to\nprovide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you being thereporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (But don’t get any ideas!)\nInsurance\nLet’s look first at insurance, Berkshire’s core operation. That industry has been the engine that has\npropelled our expansion since 1967, when we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire &Marine, for $8.6 million. Though that purchase had monumental consequences for Berkshire, its execution wassimplicity itself.\nJack Ringwalt, a friend of mine who was the controlling shareholder of the two companies, came to my\noffice saying he would like to sell. Fifteen minutes later, we had a deal. Neither of Jack’s companies had ever had anaudit by a public accounting firm, and I didn’t ask for one. My reasoning: (1) Jack was honest and (2) He was also abit quirky and likely to walk away if the deal became at all complicated.\nOn pages 128-129, we reproduce the 1\n1⁄2-page purchase agreement we used to finalize the transaction.\nThat contract was homemade: Neither side used a lawyer. Per page, this has to be Berkshire’s best deal: NationalIndemnity today has GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net worth of $111 billion, which exceeds thatof any other insurer in the world.\nOne reason we were attracted to the property-casualty business was its financial characteristics: P/C\ninsurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certainworkers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later modelleaves P/C companies holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile,insurers get to invest this float for their benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount offloat an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our businessgrows, so does our float. And howwe have grown, as the following table shows:\nYear\nFloat (in $ millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322014 83,921\nFurther gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO and our new commercial\ninsurance operation are almost certain to grow at a good clip. National Indemnity’s reinsurance division, however, isparty to a number of run-off contracts whose float drifts downward. If we do in time experience a decline in float, itwill be very gradual – at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that\nwe can never be subject to immediate demands for sums that are large compared to our cash resources. This strength\nis a key pillar in Berkshire’s economic fortress.\n8\n\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money– and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so\nvigorous indeed that it frequently causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss.\nThis loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that theinsurance industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earningsubnormal returns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses. The prolonged period of lowinterest rates our country is now dealing with causes earnings on float to decrease, thereby exacerbating the profitproblems of the industry.\nAs noted in the first section of this report, Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for\ntwelve consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $24 billion. Looking ahead, I believe wewill continue to underwrite profitably in most years. Doing so is the daily focus of allof our insurance managers,\nwho know that while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned by poor underwriting results. That message isgiven at least lip service by all insurers; at Berkshire it is a religion.\nSo how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire’s book value is calculated, the fullamount\nof our float is deducted as a liability , just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think\nof float as strictly a liability is incorrect; it should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claimsand related expenses – a huge $22.7 billion to more than six million claimants in 2014 – and that reduces float. Justas surely, we each day write new business and thereby generate new claims that add to float.\nIf our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this\nliability is dramatically less than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises –\nbecause new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute – is worlds different from owing $1 that will go out thedoor tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities are treated as equals, however, under GAAP.\nA partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion “goodwill” asset that we incurred in buying\nour insurance companies and that increases book value. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paidfor the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing\non its true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any\ngoodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\nFortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\ninsurance goodwill – what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance\noperation possessing it – to be farin excess of its historic carrying value. Under present accounting rules (with\nwhich we agree) this excess value will never be entered on our books. But I can assure you that it’s real. That’s one\nreason – a huge reason – why we believe Berkshire’s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.\n************\nBerkshire’s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running\ndisciplined operations that possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks\nthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks thatare inappropriate in relation to our resources.\n9\n\nIndeed, we are farmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if the\ninsurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe – a loss about triple anythingit has ever experienced – Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of itsmany streams of earnings. We would also remain awash in cash and be looking for large opportunities in a marketthat might well have gone into shock. Meanwhile, other major insurers and reinsurers would be far in the red, if notfacing insolvency.\nAjit’s underwriting skills are unmatched. His mind, moreover, is an idea factory that is always looking\nfor more lines of business he can add to his current assortment. Last year I told you about his formation of BerkshireHathaway Specialty Insurance (“BHSI”). This initiative took us into commercial insurance, where we were instantlywelcomed by both major insurance brokers and corporate risk managers throughout America. Previously, we hadwritten only a few specialized lines of commercial insurance.\nBHSI is led by Peter Eastwood, an experienced underwriter who is widely respected in the insurance\nworld. During 2014, Peter expanded his talented group, moving into both international business and new lines ofinsurance. We repeat last year’s prediction that BHSI will be a major asset for Berkshire, one that will generatevolume in the billions within a few years.\n************\nWe have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actuallycausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after bothprospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriatepremium can’t be obtained.\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can’t turn their back on business\nthat is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, “The other guy is doing it, so we must as well,”spells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.\nTad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re’s huge\nfloat has been considerably better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue.We are particularly enthusiastic about General Re’s international life reinsurance business, which has grownconsistently and profitably since we acquired the company in 1998.\nIt can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, it was beset by problems that caused\ncommentators – and me as well, briefly – to believe I had made a huge mistake. That day is long gone. General Reis now a gem.\n************\nFinally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 64 years ago. GEICO is managed by Tony\nNicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 53 years of service in 2014. Tony became CEO in 1993, andsince then the company has been flying. There is nobetter manager than Tony.\nWhen I was first introduced to GEICO in January 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage the\ncompany enjoyed compared to the expenses borne by the giants of the industry. It was clear to me that GEICOwould succeed because it deserved to succeed. No one likes to buy auto insurance. Almost everyone, though, likes\nto drive. The insurance consequently needed is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them – andonly a low-cost operation can deliver these. Indeed, at least 40% of the people reading this letter can save money by\ninsuring with GEICO. So stop reading and go to geico.com or call 800-368-2734.\n10\n\nGEICO’s cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year after\nyear. (We ended 2014 at 10.8% compared to 2.5% in 1995, when Berkshire acquired control of GEICO.) Thecompany’s low costs create a moat – an enduring one – that competitors are unable to cross. Our gecko never tires\nof telling Americans how GEICO can save them important money. The gecko, I should add, has one particularlyendearing quality – he works without pay. Unlike a human spokesperson, he never gets a swelled head from hisfame nor does he have an agent to constantly remind us how valuable he is. I love the little guy.\n************\nIn addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them\nplying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. In aggregate, these companies are a growing operation thatconsistently delivers an underwriting profit. Indeed, over the past decade, they have earned $2.95 billion fromunderwriting while growing their float from $1.7 billion to $8.6 billion. Charlie and I treasure these companies andtheir managers.\nUnderwriting Profit\nYearend Float\n(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2014 2013 2014 2013\nBH Reinsurance .................................... $ 6 0 6 $1,294 $42,454 $37,231\nGeneral Re ......................................... 2 7 7 2 8 3 19,280 20,013\nGEICO ............................................ 1,159 1,127 13,569 12,566\nOther Primary ...................................... 6 2 6 3 8 5 8,618 7,430\n$2,668 $3,089 $83,921 $77,240\n************\nSimply put, insurance is the sale of promises. The “customer” pays money now; the insurer promises to\npay money in the future should certain unwanted events occur.\nSometimes, the promise will not be tested for decades. (Think of life insurance bought by people in their\n20s.) Therefore, both the ability and willingness of the insurer to pay, even if economic chaos prevails whenpayment time arrives, is all-important.\nBerkshire’s promises have no equal, a fact affirmed in recent years by certain of the world’s largest and\nmost sophisticated P/C insurers, who wished to shed themselves of huge and exceptionally long-lived liabilities.That is, these insurers wished to “cede” these liabilities – most of them potential losses from asbestos claims – to areinsurer. They needed the right one, though: If a reinsurer fails to pay a loss, the original insurer is still on the hookfor it. Choosing a reinsurer, therefore, that down the road proves to be financially strapped or a bad actor threatensthe original insurer with getting huge liabilities right back in its lap.\nLast year, our premier position in reinsurance was reaffirmed by our writing a policy carrying a $3 billion\nsingle premium. I believe that the policy’s size has only been exceeded by our 2007 transaction with Lloyd’s, inwhich the premium was $7.1 billion.\nIn fact, I know of only eight P/C policies in history that had a single premium exceeding $1 billion. And,\nyes, all eight were written by Berkshire. Certain of these contracts will require us to make substantial payments 50years or more from now. When major insurers have needed an unquestionable promise that payments of this typewill be made, Berkshire has been the party – the only party – to call.\n************\nBerkshire’s great managers, premier financial strength and a variety of business models protected by\nwide moats amount to something unique in the insurance world. This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset forBerkshire shareholders that will only get more valuable with time.\n11\n\nRegulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\nWe have two major operations, BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”), that share important\ncharacteristics distinguishing them from our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section inthis letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.\nA key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, with\nthese partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact\nnot needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions will far exceedits interest requirements. Last year, for example, BNSF’s interest coverage was more than 8:1. (Our definition ofcoverage is pre-tax earnings/interest, notEBITDA/interest, a commonly used measure we view as seriously flawed.)\nAt BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company’s ability to service its debt under all circumstances.\nThe first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companies offering anessential service on an exclusive basis. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great diversity of earningsstreams, which shield us from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body. Recently, we have furtherbroadened that base through our $3 billion (Canadian) acquisition of AltaLink, an electric transmission systemserving 85% of Alberta’s population. This multitude of profit streams, supplemented by the inherent advantage ofbeing owned by a strong parent, has enabled BHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost of debt.This economic fact benefits both us andour customers.\nEvery day, our two subsidiaries power the American economy in major ways:\n BNSF carries about 15% (measured by ton-miles) of allinter-city freight, whether it is transported by\ntruck, rail, water, air, or pipeline. Indeed, we move more ton-miles of goods than anyone else, a fact\nestablishing BNSF as the most important artery in our economy’s circulatory system.\nBNSF, like all railroads, also moves its cargo in an extraordinarily fuel-efficient and environmentally\nfriendly way, carrying a ton of freight about 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. Trucks taking onthe same job guzzle about four times as much fuel.\n BHE’s utilities serve regulated retail customers in eleven states. No utility company stretches further. In\naddition, we are a leader in renewables: From a standing start ten years ago, BHE now accounts for 6% ofthe country’s wind generation capacity and 7% of its solar generation capacity. Beyond these businesses,BHE owns two large pipelines that deliver 8% of our country’s natural gas consumption; the recently-purchased electric transmission operation in Canada; and major electric businesses in the U.K. andPhilippines. And the beat goes on: We will continue to buy and build utility operations throughout theworld for decades to come.\nBHE can make these investments because it retains allof its earnings. In fact, last year the company\nretained more dollars of earnings – by far – than any other American electric utility. We and ourregulators see this 100% retention policy as an important advantage – one almost certain to distinguishBHE from other utilities for many years to come.\nWhen BHE completes certain renewables projects that are underway, the company’s renewables portfolio\nwill have cost $15 billion. In addition, we have conventional projects in the works that will also cost many billions.We relish making such commitments as long as they promise reasonable returns – and, on that front, we put a largeamount of trust in future regulation.\nOur confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever\nneed massive investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capitalproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in ourself-interest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people theyrepresent.\n12\n\nLast year we fully met this objective at BHE, just as we have in every year of our ownership. Our rates\nremain low, our customer satisfaction is high and our record for employee safety is among the best in the industry.\nThe story at BNSF, however – as I noted earlier – was not good in 2014, a year in which the railroad\ndisappointed many of its customers. This problem occurred despite the record capital expenditures that BNSF hasmade in recent years, with those having far exceeded the outlays made by Union Pacific, our principal competitor.\nThe two railroads are of roughly equal size measured by revenues, though we carry considerably more\nfreight (measured either by carloads or ton-miles). But our service problems exceeded Union Pacific’s last year, andwe lost market share as a result. Moreover, U.P.’s earnings beat ours by a record amount. Clearly, we have a lot ofwork to do.\nWe are wasting no time: As I also mentioned earlier, we will spend $6 billion in 2015 on improving our\nrailroad’s operation. That will amount to about 26% of estimated revenues (a calculation that serves as theindustry’s yardstick). Outlays of this magnitude are largely unheard of among railroads. For us, this percentagecompares to our average of 18% in 2009-2013 and to U.P.’s projection for the near future of 16-17%. Our hugeinvestments will soon lead to a system with greater capacity and much better service. Improved profits shouldfollow.\nHere are the key figures for Berkshire Hathaway Energy and BNSF:\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy (89.9% owned)\nEarnings (in millions)\n2014 2013 2012\nU.K. utilities ................................................................ $ 5 2 7 $ 3 6 2 $ 4 2 9\nIowa utility ................................................................. 2 9 8 2 3 0 2 3 6\nNevada utilities ............................................................. 5 4 9 — —\nPacifiCorp (primarily Oregon and Utah) ..................................... 1,010 982 737\nGas Pipelines (Northern Natural and Kern River) ............................ 3 7 9 3 8 5 3 8 3\nHomeServices .............................................................. 1 3 9 1 3 9 8 2\nOther (net) .................................................................. 2 3 6 4 9 1\nOperating earnings before corporate interest and taxes ....................... 3,138 2,102 1,958\nInterest ..................................................................... 4 2 7 2 9 6 3 1 4\nIncome taxes ................................................................ 6 1 6 1 7 0 1 7 2\nNet earnings ................................................................ $ 2,095 $ 1,636 $ 1,472\nEarnings applicable to Berkshire ............................................ $ 1,882 $ 1,470 $ 1,323\nBNSF Earnings (in millions)\n2014 2013 2012\nRevenues ................................................................... $23,239 $22,014 $20,835\nOperating expenses ......................................................... 16,237 15,357 14,835\nOperating earnings before interest and taxes ................................. 7,002 6,657 6,000\nInterest (net) ................................................................ 8 3 3 7 2 9 6 2 3\nIncome taxes ................................................................ 2,300 2,135 2,005\nNet earnings ................................................................ $ 3,869 $ 3,793 $ 3,372\n13\n\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations\nOur activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront.

In contrast, the operating expense\nfigures above are non-GAAP and exclude some purchase-accounting items (primarily the amortization of certainintangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers moreaccurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businesses aggregated in the table than do GAAPfigures.\nI won’t explain all of the adjustments – some are tiny and arcane – but serious investors should understand\nthe disparate nature of intangible assets. Some truly deplete over time, while others in no way lose value. For\nsoftware, as a big example, amortization charges are very real expenses. The concept of making charges againstother intangibles, such as the amortization of customer relationships, however, arises through purchase-accountingrules and clearly does not reflect reality. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges.Both, that is, are recorded as expenses when earnings are calculated – even though from an investor’s viewpointthey could not be more different.\n14\n\nIn the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 49, amortization charges of $1.15 billion have been\ndeducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these “real,” the rest not. The “non-real” charges, once non-existent at Berkshire, have become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. Non-realamortization charges will almost certainly rise further as we acquire more companies.\nThe GAAP-compliant table on page 67 gives you the current status of our intangible assets. We now have\n$7.4 billion left to amortize, of which $4.1 billion will be charged over the next five years. Eventually, of course,every dollar of non-real costs becomes entirely charged off. When that happens, reported earnings increase even iftrue earnings are flat.\nDepreciation charges, we want to emphasize, are different: Every dime of depreciation expense we report\nis a real cost. That’s true, moreover, at most other companies. When CEOs tout EBITDA as a valuation guide, wirethem up for a polygraph test.\nOur public reports of earnings will, of course, continue to conform to GAAP. To embrace reality, however,\nyou should remember to add back most of the amortization charges we report.\n************\nTo get back to our many manufacturing, service and retailing operations, they sell products ranging from\nlollipops to jet airplanes. Some of this sector’s businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets,\nenjoy terrific economics, producing profits that run from 25% after-tax to far more than 100%. Others generate goodreturns in the area of 12% to 20%. A few, however, have very poor returns, the result of some serious mistakes Imade in my job of capital allocation. I was not misled: I simply was wrong in my evaluation of the economicdynamics of the company or the industry in which it operates.\nFortunately, my blunders normally involved relatively small acquisitions. Our large buys have generally\nworked out well and, in a few cases, more than well. I have not, nonetheless, made my last mistake in purchasingeither businesses or stocks. Not everything works out as planned.\nViewed as a single entity, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employed an average\nof $24 billion of net tangible assets during 2014 and, despite their holding large quantities of excess cash and usinglittle leverage, earned 18.7% after-tax on that capital.\nOf course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if it is bought for too high a price. We\nhave paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the largefigure we show for goodwill. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we have deployed inthis sector. Furthermore, the intrinsic value of these businesses, in aggregate, exceeds their carrying value by a goodmargin, and that premium is likely to widen. Even so, the difference between intrinsic value and carrying value inboth the insurance and regulated-industry segments is fargreater. It is there that the truly big winners reside.\n************\nWe have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, their\ncompetitors – both current and potential – read this report. In a few of our businesses we might be disadvantaged ifothers knew our numbers. In some of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of Berkshire,therefore, we only disclose what is required. You can find a good bit of detail about many of our operations,however, on pages 97-100.\n15\n\nFinance and Financial Products\nThis year we include in this section Marmon’s very sizable leasing operations, whose wares are railcars,\ncontainers and cranes. We have also restated the previous two years to reflect that change. Why have we made it? Atone time there was a large minority ownership at Marmon, and I felt it was more understandable to include all of thecompany’s operations in one place. Today we own virtually 100% of Marmon, which makes me think you will gainmore insight into our various businesses if we include Marmon’s leasing operations under this heading. (The figuresfor the many dozens of Marmon’s other businesses remain in the previous section.)\nOur other leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture) and XTRA (semi-trailers).\nThese companies are industry leaders and have substantially increased their earnings as the American economy hasgained strength. Both companies have invested more money in new equipment than have many of their competitors,and that’s paying off.\nKevin Clayton has again delivered an industry-leading performance at Clayton Homes, the largest home\nbuilder in America. Last year, Clayton sold 30,871 homes, about 45% of the manufactured homes bought byAmericans. When we purchased Clayton in 2003 for $1.7 billion, its share was 14%.\nKey to Clayton’s earnings is the company’s $13 billion mortgage portfolio. During the financial panic of\n2008 and 2009, when funding for the industry dried up, Clayton was able to keep lending because of Berkshire’sbacking. In fact, we continued during that period to finance our competitors’ retail sales as well as our own.\nMany of Clayton’s borrowers have low incomes and mediocre FICO scores. But thanks to the company’s\nsensible lending practices, its portfolio performed well during the recession, meaning a very high percentage of ourborrowers kept their homes. Our blue-collar borrowers, in many cases, proved much better credit risks than theirhigher-income brethren.\nAt Marmon’s railroad-car operation, lease rates have improved substantially over the past few years. The\nnature of this business, however, is that only 20% or so of our leases expire annually. Consequently, improvedpricing only gradually works its way into our revenue stream. The trend, though, is strong. Our 105,000-car fleetconsists largely of tank cars, but only 8% of those transport crude oil.\nOne further fact about our rail operation is important for you to know: Unlike many other lessors, we\nmanufacture our own tank cars, about 6,000 of them in a good year. We do not book anyprofit when we transfer\ncars from our manufacturing division to our leasing division. Our fleet is consequently placed on our books at a“bargain” price. The difference between that figure and a “retail” price is only slowly reflected in our earningsthrough smaller annual depreciation charges that we enjoy over the 30-year life of the car. Because of that fact aswell as others, Marmon’s rail fleet is worth considerably more than the $5 billion figure at which it is carried on ourbooks.\nHere’s the earnings recap for this sector:\n2014\n2013 2012\n(in millions)\nBerkadia (our 50% share) ............. $ 1 2 2 $ 8 0 $ 3 5\nClayton ............................... 5 5 8 4 1 6 2 5 5\nCORT ................................ 3 6 4 0 4 2\nMarmon – Containers and Cranes ..... 2 3 8 2 2 6 2 4 6\nMarmon – Railcars .................... 4 4 2 3 5 3 2 9 9\nXTRA ................................ 1 4 7 1 2 5 1 0 6\nNet financial income* ................. 2 9 6 3 2 4 4 1 0\n$ 1,839 $ 1,564 $ 1,393\n* Excludes capital gains or losses\n16\n\nInvestments\nBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value.\n12/31/14\nShares** CompanyPercentage of\nCompany\nOwnedCost* Market\n(in millions)\n151,610,700 American Express Company ................. 14.8 $ 1,287 $ 14,106\n400,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company .................... 9 . 2 1,299 16,888\n18,513,482 DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. ............. 8 . 6 8 4 3 1,402\n15,430,586 Deere & Company .......................... 4 . 5 1,253 1,365\n24,617,939 DIRECTV .................................. 4 . 9 1,454 2,134\n13,062,594 The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. ............. 3 . 0 7 5 0 2,532\n76,971,817 International Business Machines Corp. ...... 7 . 8 13,157 12,349\n24,669,778 Moody’s Corporation ........................ 12.1 248 2,364\n20,060,390 Munich Re .................................. 11.8 2,990 4,023\n52,477,678 The Procter & Gamble Company ............ 1 . 9 3 3 6 4,683 ***\n22,169,930 Sanofi ....................................... 1 . 7 1,721 2,032\n96,890,665 U.S. Bancorp ................................ 5 . 4 3,033 4,355\n43,387,980 USG Corporation ............................ 30.0 836 1,214\n67,707,544 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ....................... 2 . 1 3,798 5,815\n483,470,853 Wells Fargo & Company .................... 9 . 4 11,871 26,504\nOthers ....................................... 10,180 15,704\nTotal Common Stocks Carried at Market .... $55,056 $ 117,470\n*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP “cost” differs in a few cases because of write-ups or\nwrite-downs that have been required under GAAP rules.\n**Excludes shares held by pension funds of Berkshire subsidiaries.***Held under contract of sale for this amount.\nBerkshire has one major equity position that is not included in the table: We can buy 700 million shares\nof Bank of America at any time prior to September 2021 for $5 billion. At yearend these shares were worth $12.5billion. We are likely to purchase the shares just before expiration of our option. In the meantime, it is important foryou to realize that Bank of America is, in effect, our fourth largest equity investment – and one we value highly.\n************\nAttentive readers will notice that Tesco, which last year appeared in the list of our largest common stock\ninvestments, is now absent. An attentive investor , I’m embarrassed to report, would have sold Tesco shares earlier. I\nmade a big mistake with this investment by dawdling.\nAt the end of 2012 we owned 415 million shares of Tesco, then and now the leading food retailer in the\nU.K. and an important grocer in other countries as well. Our cost for this investment was $2.3 billion, and themarket value was a similar amount.\n17\n\nIn 2013, I soured somewhat on the company’s then-management and sold 114 million shares, realizing a\nprofit of $43 million. My leisurely pace in making sales would prove expensive. Charlie calls this sort of behavior“thumb-sucking.” (Considering what my delay cost us, he is being kind.)\nDuring 2014, Tesco’s problems worsened by the month. The company’s market share fell, its margins\ncontracted and accounting problems surfaced. In the world of business, bad news often surfaces serially: You see acockroach in your kitchen; as the days go by, you meet his relatives.\nWe sold Tesco shares throughout the year and are now out of the position. (The company, we should\nmention, has hired new management, and we wish them well.) Our after-tax loss from this investment was $444million, about 1/5 of 1% of Berkshire’s net worth. In the past 50 years, we have only once realized an investmentloss that at the time of sale cost us 2% of our net worth. Twice, we experienced 1% losses. All three of these lossesoccurred in the 1974-1975 period, when we sold stocks that were very cheap in order to buy others we believed tobe even cheaper.\n************\nOur investment results have been helped by a terrific tailwind. During the 1964-2014 period, the S&P 500\nrose from 84 to 2,059, which, with reinvested dividends, generated the overall return of 11,196% shown on page 2.\nConcurrently, the purchasing power of the dollar declined a staggering 87%. That decrease means that it now takes$1 to buy what could be bought for 13¢ in 1965 (as measured by the Consumer Price Index).\nThere is an important message for investors in that disparate performance between stocks and dollars.\nThink back to our 2011 annual report, in which we defined investing as “the transfer to others of purchasing powernow with the reasoned expectation of receiving more purchasing power – after taxes have been paid on nominal\ngains – in the future.”\nThe unconventional, but inescapable, conclusion to be drawn from the past fifty years is that it has been far\nsafer to invest in a diversified collection of American businesses than to invest in securities – Treasuries, forexample – whose values have been tied to American currency. That was also true in the preceding half-century, aperiod including the Great Depression and two world wars. Investors should heed this history. To one degree oranother it is almost certain to be repeated during the next century.\nStock prices will always be far more volatile than cash-equivalent holdings. Over the long term , however,\ncurrency-denominated instruments are riskier investments – farriskier investments – than widely-diversified stock\nportfolios that are bought over time and that are owned in a manner invoking only token fees and commissions. Thatlesson has not customarily been taught in business schools, where volatility is almost universally used as a proxy forrisk. Though this pedagogic assumption makes for easy teaching, it is dead wrong: Volatility is farfrom\nsynonymous with risk. Popular formulas that equate the two terms lead students, investors and CEOs astray.\nIt is true, of course, that owning equities for a day or a week or a year is far riskier (in both nominal and\npurchasing-power terms) than leaving funds in cash-equivalents. That is relevant to certain investors – say,investment banks – whose viability can be threatened by declines in asset prices and which might be forced to sellsecurities during depressed markets. Additionally, any party that might have meaningful near-term needs for fundsshould keep appropriate sums in Treasuries or insured bank deposits.\nFor the great majority of investors, however, who can – and should – invest with a multi-decade horizon,\nquotational declines are unimportant. Their focus should remain fixed on attaining significant gains in purchasingpower over their investing lifetime. For them, a diversified equity portfolio, bought over time , will prove far less\nrisky than dollar-based securities.\n18\n\nIf the investor, instead, fears price volatility, erroneously viewing it as a measure of risk, he may,\nironically, end up doing some very risky things. Recall, if you will, the pundits who six years ago bemoaned fallingstock prices and advised investing in “safe” Treasury bills or bank certificates of deposit. People who heeded thissermon are now earning a pittance on sums they had previously expected would finance a pleasant retirement. (TheS&P 500 was then below 700; now it is about 2,100.) If not for their fear of meaningless price volatility, theseinvestors could have assured themselves of a good income for life by simply buying a very low-cost index fundwhose dividends would trend upward over the years and whose principal would grow as well (with many ups anddowns, to be sure).\nInvestors, of course, can, by their own behavior , make stock ownership highly risky. And many do. Active\ntrading, attempts to “time” market movements, inadequate diversification, the payment of high and unnecessary feesto managers and advisors, and the use of borrowed money can destroy the decent returns that a life-long owner ofequities would otherwise enjoy. Indeed, borrowed money has noplace in the investor’s tool kit: Anything can\nhappen anytime in markets. And no advisor, economist, or TV commentator – and definitely not Charlie nor I – can\ntell you when chaos will occur. Market forecasters will fill your ear but will never fill your wallet.\nThe commission of the investment sins listed above is not limited to “the little guy.” Huge institutional\ninvestors, viewed as a group, have long underperformed the unsophisticated index-fund investor who simply sitstight for decades. A major reason has been fees: Many institutions pay substantial sums to consultants who, in turn,recommend high-fee managers. And that is a fool’s game.\nThere are a few investment managers, of course, who are very good – though in the short run, it’s difficult\nto determine whether a great record is due to luck or talent. Most advisors, however, are far better at generating highfees than they are at generating high returns. In truth, their core competence is salesmanship. Rather than listen totheir siren songs, investors – large and small – should instead read Jack Bogle’s The Little Book of Common Sense\nInvesting .\nDecades ago, Ben Graham pinpointed the blame for investment failure, using a quote from Shakespeare:\n“The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.”\nThe Annual Meeting\nThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 2\nndat the CenturyLink Center. Last year’s attendance\nof 39,000 set a record, and we expect a further increase this year as we celebrate our Golden Anniversary. Be therewhen the doors open at 7 a.m.\nBerkshire’s talented Carrie Sova will again be in charge. Carrie joined us six years ago at the age of 24 as\na secretary. Then, four years ago, I asked her to take charge of the meeting – a huge undertaking, requiring amultitude of skills – and she jumped at the chance. Carrie is unflappable, ingenious and expert at bringing out thebest in the hundreds who work with her. She is aided by our entire home office crew who enjoy pitching in to makethe weekend fun and informative for our owners.\nAnd, yes, we also try to sell our visiting shareholders our products while they’re here. In fact, this year\nwe will substantially increase the hours available for purchases, opening for business at the CenturyLink on Friday,May 1\nst, from noon to 5 p.m. as well as the usual 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. on meeting day. So bring a smile to Charlie’s face\nand do some serious shopping.\nGet up early on Saturday morning. At 6:20 a.m., Norman and Jake, two Texas longhorns each weighing\nabout a ton, will proceed down 10thStreet to the CenturyLink. Aboard them will be a couple of our Justin Boot\nexecutives, who do double duty as cowboys. Following the steers will be four horses pulling a Wells Fargostagecoach. Berkshire already markets planes, trains and automobiles. Adding steers and stagecoaches to ourportfolio should seal our reputation as America’s all-purpose transportation company.\n19\n\nAt about 7:30 a.m. on Saturday, we will have our fourth International Newspaper Tossing Challenge. Our\ntarget again will be a Clayton Home porch, located precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. When I was a teenager– in my one brief flirtation with honest labor – I tossed about 500,000 papers. So I think I’m pretty good. Challengeme! Humiliate me! Knock me down a peg! I’ll buy a Dilly Bar for anyone who lands his or her throw closer to thedoorstep than I do. The papers will run 36 to 42 pages, and you must fold them yourself (no rubber bands allowed).I’ll present a special prize to the 12-or-under contestant who makes the best toss. Deb Bosanek will be the judge.\nAt 8:30 a.m., a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answer\nperiod, which (with a break for lunch at CenturyLink’s stands) will last until 3:30 p.m. After a short recess, Charlieand I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45 p.m. This business session typically lasts only a half hour or so.\nYour venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in which\nproducts from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries will be for sale. If you don’t get your shopping done on Friday, slipout while Charlie’s talking on Saturday and binge on our bargains. Check the terrific BNSF railroad layout also.Even though I’m 84, it still excites me.\nLast year you did your part as a shopper, and most of our businesses racked up record sales. In a nine-hour\nperiod on Saturday, we sold 1,385 pairs of Justin boots (that’s a pair every 23 seconds), 13,440 pounds of See’scandy, 7,276 pairs of Wells Lamont work gloves and 10,000 bottles of Heinz ketchup. Heinz has a new mustardproduct, so both mustard and ketchup will be available this year. (Buy both!) Now that we are open for business onFriday as well, we expect new records in every precinct.\nBrooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at the\nmeeting. After you purchase a pair, wear them the next day at our third annual “Berkshire 5K,” an 8 a.m. racestarting at the CenturyLink. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor’s Guide that will be sent toyou with your credentials for the meeting. Entrants in the race will find themselves running alongside many ofBerkshire’s managers, directors and associates. (Charlie and I, however, will sleep in.)\nA GEICO booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company’s top counselors from\naround the country. Stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount(usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplementalpoint: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another discount, such as that available to certain groups.)Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out our price. We can save many of you real money.\nBe sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry about 35 books and DVDs, among them a couple of new\ntitles. Last year, many shareholders purchased Max Olson’s compilation of Berkshire letters going back to 1965,and he has produced an updated edition for the meeting. We also expect to be selling an inexpensive bookcommemorating our fifty years. It’s currently a work in process, but I expect it to contain a wide variety of historicalmaterial, including documents from the 19\nthCentury.\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to both the meeting and other events. Airlines have sometimes jacked upprices for the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City vs.Omaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2\n1⁄2hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you\nsignificant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. The savings for a couple could run to$1,000 or more. Spend that money with us.\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72\nndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we will\nagain be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. Last year in the week surrounding the meeting, the store dida record $40,481,817 of business. (An average week for NFM’s Omaha store is about $9 million.)\n20\n\nTo obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, April 28th\nand Monday, May 4thinclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even\napply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting butwhich, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation.NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. on Saturday and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.on Sunday. From 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday, NFM is having a picnic to which you are all invited.\nAt Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from\n6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 1\nst. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 3rd, from 9 a.m. to 4\np.m. On Saturday, we will remain open until 6 p.m. In recent years, our three-day volume has far exceeded our salesin all of December, normally a jeweler’s best month.\nWe will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 27\nththrough Saturday, May 9th. During that period, please\nidentify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that shows youare a Berkshire holder.\nOn Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, Norman Beck, a remarkable magician from Dallas, will\nbewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the world’s top bridgeexperts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. Don’t play them for money.\nMy friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. I met\nAriel when she was nine and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Now, she’s a sophomore atPrinceton, having already represented the United States in the 2012 Olympics. If you don’t mind embarrassingyourself, test your skills against her, beginning at 1 p.m. Bill Gates and I will lead off and try to soften her up.\nGorat’s and Piccolo’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 3\nrd.\nBoth will be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat’s opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo’s opening at 4 p.m. These restaurantsare my favorites, and I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening. Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat’s,call 402-551-3733 on April 1\nst(but not before ); for Piccolo’s, call 402-346-2865. At Piccolo’s, order a giant root\nbeer float for dessert. Only sissies get the small one.\nWe will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the\nmeeting, asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists andtheir e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, who retired last year after sixty years at Fortune, but remains theexpert on\nbusiness and financial matters, and who may be e-mailed at loomisbrk@gmail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, atBerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.\nFrom the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most\ninteresting and important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if youkeep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than twoquestions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your namementioned if your question is asked.)\nWe will also have a panel of three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the insurance specialist will\nbe Gary Ransom of Dowling & Partners. Questions that deal with our non-insurance operations will come fromJonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Our hope is that the analysts andjournalists will ask questions that add to our owners’ understanding and knowledge of their investment.\n21\n\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough,\nfor sure, and that’s the way we like it. All told we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from eachanalyst and journalist and for 18 from the audience. (Last year we had 62 in total.) The questioners from theaudience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that will take place at 8:15 a.m. on the morning of the annualmeeting. Each of the 11 microphones installed in the arena and main overflow room will host, so to speak, adrawing.\nWhile I’m on the subject of our owners’ gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believe\nall shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and should also haveadequate time to analyze it. That’s why we try to issue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and whyour annual meeting is always held on a Saturday. We do not talk one-on-one to large institutional investors oranalysts, treating them instead as we do all other shareholders.\n************\nWe get terrific help at meeting time from literally thousands of Omaha residents and businesses who\nwant you to enjoy yourselves. This year, because we expect record attendance, we have worried about a shortage ofhotel rooms. To deal with that possible problem, Airbnb is making a special effort to obtain listings for the periodaround meeting time and is likely to have a wide array of accommodations to offer. Airbnb’s services may beespecially helpful to shareholders who expect to spend only a single night in Omaha and are aware that last year afew hotels required guests to pay for a minimum of three nights. That gets expensive. Those people on a tightbudget should check the Airbnb website.\n************\nFor good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-\nStars who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I believe the mindset of ourmanagers also to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies.Most of our managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business “home runs” means as much tothem as their paycheck.\nEqually important, however, are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office. This\ngroup efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 24,100-page Federalincome tax return and oversees the filing of 3,400 state tax returns, responds to countless shareholder and mediainquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country’s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board’sactivities – and the list goes on and on.\nThey handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy\nand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year they dealt with the 40universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They also handleall kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and french fries (smothered inHeinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly do feel like tap dancing to work every day.\nLast year, for the annual report, we dropped our 48-year-old “no pictures” policy – who says I’m not\nflexible? – and ran a photo of our remarkable home-office crew that was taken at our Christmas lunch. I didn’t warnthe gang of the public exposure they were to receive, so they didn’t have on their Sunday best. This year was adifferent story: On the facing page you will see what our group looks like when they think someone will be noticing.However they dress, their performance is mind-boggling.\nCome meet them on May 2\nndand enjoy our Woodstock for Capitalists.\nFebruary 27, 2015\nWarren E. BuffettChairman of the Board\n22\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nACQUISITION CRITERIA\nWe are eager to hear from principals or their representatives about businesses that meet all of the following criteria:\n(1) Large purchases (at least $75 million of pre-tax earnings unless the business will fit into one of our existing units),\n(2) Demonstrated consistent earning power (future projections are of no interest to us, nor are “turnaround” situations),(3) Businesses earning good returns on equity while employing little or no debt,(4) Management in place (we can’t supply it),(5) Simple businesses (if there’s lots of technology, we won’t understand it),(6) An offering price (we don’t want to waste our time or that of the seller by talking, even preliminarily, about a transaction\nwhen price is unknown).\nThe larger the company, the greater will be our interest: We would like to make an acquisition in the $5-20 billion range. We\nare not interested, however, in receiving suggestions about purchases we might make in the general stock market.\nWe will not engage in unfriendly takeovers. We can promise complete confidentiality and a very fast answer – customarily\nwithin five minutes – as to whether we’re interested. We prefer to buy for cash, but will consider issuing stock when we receive asmuch in intrinsic business value as we give. We don’t participate in auctions .\nCharlie and I frequently get approached about acquisitions that don’t come close to meeting our tests: We’ve found that if you\nadvertise an interest in buying collies, a lot of people will call hoping to sell you their cocker spaniels. A line from a country songexpresses our feeling about new ventures, turnarounds, or auction-like sales: “When the phone don’t ring, you’ll know it’s me.”\n23\n\nBerkshire – Past, Present and Future\nIn the Beginning\nOn May 6, 1964, Berkshire Hathaway, then run by a man named Seabury Stanton, sent a letter to its\nshareholders offering to buy 225,000 shares of its stock for $11.375 per share. I had expected the letter; I wassurprised by the price.\nBerkshire then had 1,583,680 shares outstanding. About 7% of these were owned by Buffett Partnership\nLtd. (“BPL”), an investing entity that I managed and in which I had virtually all of my net worth. Shortly before thetender offer was mailed, Stanton had asked me at what price BPL would sell its holdings. I answered $11.50, and hesaid, “Fine, we have a deal.” Then came Berkshire’s letter, offering an eighth of a point less. I bristled at Stanton’sbehavior and didn’t tender.\nThat was a monumentally stupid decision.Berkshire was then a northern textile manufacturer mired in a terrible business. The industry in which it\noperated was heading south, both metaphorically and physically. And Berkshire, for a variety of reasons, was unableto change course.\nThat was true even though the industry’s problems had long been widely understood. Berkshire’s own\nBoard minutes of July 29, 1954, laid out the grim facts: “The textile industry in New England started going out ofbusiness forty years ago. During the war years this trend was stopped. The trend must continue until supply anddemand have been balanced.”\nAbout a year after that board meeting, Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates and Hathaway Manufacturing –\nboth with roots in the 19\nthCentury – joined forces, taking the name we bear today. With its fourteen plants and\n10,000 employees, the merged company became the giant of New England textiles. What the two managementsviewed as a merger agreement, however, soon morphed into a suicide pact. During the seven years following theconsolidation, Berkshire operated at an overall loss, and its net worth shrunk by 37%.\nMeanwhile, the company closed nine plants, sometimes using the liquidation proceeds to repurchase\nshares. And that pattern caught my attention.\nI purchased BPL’s first shares of Berkshire in December 1962, anticipating more closings and more\nrepurchases. The stock was then selling for $7.50, a wide discount from per-share working capital of $10.25 andbook value of $20.20. Buying the stock at that price was like picking up a discarded cigar butt that had one puffremaining in it. Though the stub might be ugly and soggy, the puff would be free. Once that momentary pleasurewas enjoyed, however, no more could be expected.\nBerkshire thereafter stuck to the script: It soon closed another two plants, and in that May 1964 move, set\nout to repurchase shares with the shutdown proceeds. The price that Stanton offered was 50% above the cost of ouroriginal purchases. There it was – my free puff, just waiting for me, after which I could look elsewhere for otherdiscarded butts.\nInstead, irritated by Stanton’s chiseling, I ignored his offer and began to aggressively buy more Berkshire\nshares.\n24\n\nBy April 1965, BPL owned 392,633 shares (out of 1,017,547 then outstanding) and at an early-May board\nmeeting we formally took control of the company. Through Seabury’s and my childish behavior – after all, whatwas an eighth of a point to either of us? – he lost his job, and I found myself with more than 25% of BPL’s capitalinvested in a terrible business about which I knew very little. I became the dog who caught the car.\nBecause of Berkshire’s operating losses and share repurchases, its net worth at the end of fiscal 1964 had\nfallen to $22 million from $55 million at the time of the 1955 merger. The full $22 million was required by thetextile operation: The company had no excess cash and owed its bank $2.5 million. (Berkshire’s 1964 annual reportis reproduced on pages 130-142.)\nFor a time I got lucky: Berkshire immediately enjoyed two years of good operating conditions. Better yet,\nits earnings in those years were free of income tax because it possessed a large loss carry-forward that had arisenfrom the disastrous results in earlier years.\nThen the honeymoon ended. During the 18 years following 1966, we struggled unremittingly with the\ntextile business, all to no avail. But stubbornness – stupidity? – has its limits. In 1985, I finally threw in the toweland closed the operation.\n************\nUndeterred by my first mistake of committing much of BPL’s resources to a dying business, I quickly\ncompounded the error. Indeed, my second blunder was far more serious than the first, eventually becoming the mostcostly in my career.\nEarly in 1967, I had Berkshire pay $8.6 million to buy National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a small but\npromising Omaha-based insurer. (A tiny sister company was also included in the deal.) Insurance was in my sweetspot: I understood and liked the industry.\nJack Ringwalt, the owner of NICO, was a long-time friend who wanted to sell to me – me, personally. In\nno way was his offer intended for Berkshire. So why did I purchase NICO for Berkshire rather than for BPL? I’vehad 48 years to think about that question, and I’ve yet to come up with a good answer. I simply made a colossalmistake.\nIf BPL had been the purchaser, my partners and I would have owned 100% of a fine business, destined to\nform the base for building the company Berkshire has become. Moreover, our growth would not have been impededfor nearly two decades by the unproductive funds imprisoned in the textile operation. Finally, our subsequentacquisitions would have been owned in their entirety by my partners and me rather than being 39%-owned by thelegacy shareholders of Berkshire, to whom we had no obligation. Despite these facts staring me in the face, I optedto marry 100% of an excellent business (NICO) to a 61%-owned terrible business (Berkshire Hathaway), a decisionthat eventually diverted $100 billion or so from BPL partners to a collection of strangers.\n************\nOne more confession and then I’ll go on to more pleasant topics: Can you believe that in 1975 I bought\nWaumbec Mills, another New England textile company? Of course, the purchase price was a “bargain” based on theassets we received and the projected synergies with Berkshire’s existing textile business. Nevertheless – surprise,\nsurprise – Waumbec was a disaster, with the mill having to be closed down not many years later.\nAnd now some good news: The northern textile industry is finally extinct. You need no longer panic if you\nhear that I’ve been spotted wandering around New England.\n25\n\nCharlie Straightens Me Out\nMy cigar-butt strategy worked very well while I was managing small sums. Indeed, the many dozens of\nfree puffs I obtained in the 1950s made that decade by far the best of my life for both relative and absoluteinvestment performance.\nEven then, however, I made a few exceptions to cigar butts, the most important being GEICO. Thanks to a\n1951 conversation I had with Lorimer Davidson, a wonderful man who later became CEO of the company, I learnedthat GEICO was a terrific business and promptly put 65% of my $9,800 net worth into its shares. Most of my gainsin those early years, though, came from investments in mediocre companies that traded at bargain prices. BenGraham had taught me that technique, and it worked.\nBut a major weakness in this approach gradually became apparent: Cigar-butt investing was scalable only\nto a point. With large sums, it would never work well.\nIn addition, though marginal businesses purchased at cheap prices may be attractive as short-term\ninvestments, they are the wrong foundation on which to build a large and enduring enterprise. Selecting a marriagepartner clearly requires more demanding criteria than does dating. (Berkshire, it should be noted, would have been ahighly satisfactory “date”: If we had taken Seabury Stanton’s $11.375 offer for our shares, BPL’s weighted annualreturn on its Berkshire investment would have been about 40%.)\n************\nIt took Charlie Munger to break my cigar-butt habits and set the course for building a business that could\ncombine huge size with satisfactory profits. Charlie had grown up a few hundred feet from where I now live and asa youth had worked, as did I, in my grandfather’s grocery store. Nevertheless, it was 1959 before I met Charlie, longafter he had left Omaha to make Los Angeles his home. I was then 28 and he was 35. The Omaha doctor whointroduced us predicted that we would hit it off – and we did.\nIf you’ve attended our annual meetings, you know Charlie has a wide-ranging brilliance, a prodigious\nmemory, and some firm opinions. I’m not exactly wishy-washy myself, and we sometimes don’t agree. In 56 years,however, we’ve never had an argument. When we differ, Charlie usually ends the conversation by saying: “Warren,think it over and you’ll agree with me because you’re smart and I’m right.”\nWhat most of you do notknow about Charlie is that architecture is among his passions. Though he began\nhis career as a practicing lawyer (with his time billed at $15 per hour), Charlie made his first real money in his 30sby designing and building five apartment projects near Los Angeles. Concurrently, he designed the house that helives in today – some 55 years later. (Like me, Charlie can’t be budged if he is happy in his surroundings.) In recentyears, Charlie has designed large dorm complexes at Stanford and the University of Michigan and today, at age 91,is working on another major project.\nFrom my perspective, though, Charlie’s most important architectural feat was the design of today’s\nBerkshire. The blueprint he gave me was simple: Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderfulprices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices.\n26\n\nAltering my behavior is not an easy task (ask my family). I had enjoyed reasonable success without\nCharlie’s input, so why should I listen to a lawyer who had never spent a day in business school (when – ahem – I\nhad attended three ). But Charlie never tired of repeating his maxims about business and investing to me, and his\nlogic was irrefutable. Consequently, Berkshire has been built to Charlie’s blueprint. My role has been that of generalcontractor, with the CEOs of Berkshire’s subsidiaries doing the real work as sub-contractors.\nThe year 1972 was a turning point for Berkshire (though not without occasional backsliding on my part –\nremember my 1975 purchase of Waumbec). We had the opportunity then to buy See’s Candy for Blue Chip Stamps,a company in which Charlie, I and Berkshire had major stakes, and which was later merged into Berkshire.\nSee’s was a legendary West Coast manufacturer and retailer of boxed chocolates, then annually earning\nabout $4 million pre-tax while utilizing only $8 million of net tangible assets. Moreover, the company had a hugeasset that did not appear on its balance sheet: a broad and durable competitive advantage that gave it significantpricing power. That strength was virtually certain to give See’s major gains in earnings over time. Better yet, thesewould materialize with only minor amounts of incremental investment. In other words, See’s could be expected togush cash for decades to come.\nThe family controlling See’s wanted $30 million for the business, and Charlie rightly said it was worth that\nmuch. But I didn’t want to pay more than $25 million and wasn’t all that enthusiastic even at that figure. (A pricethat was three times net tangible assets made me gulp.) My misguided caution could have scuttled a terrificpurchase. But, luckily, the sellers decided to take our $25 million bid.\nTo date, See’s has earned $1.9 billion pre-tax, with its growth having required added investment of only\n$40 million. See’s has thus been able to distribute huge sums that have helped Berkshire buy other businesses that,in turn, have themselves produced large distributable profits. (Envision rabbits breeding.) Additionally, throughwatching See’s in action, I gained a business education about the value of powerful brands that opened my eyes tomany other profitable investments.\n************\nEven with Charlie’s blueprint, I have made plenty of mistakes since Waumbec. The most gruesome was\nDexter Shoe. When we purchased the company in 1993, it had a terrific record and in no way looked to me like acigar butt. Its competitive strengths, however, were soon to evaporate because of foreign competition. And I simplydidn’t see that coming.\nConsequently, Berkshire paid $433 million for Dexter and, rather promptly, its value went to zero. GAAP\naccounting, however, doesn’t come close to recording the magnitude of my error. The fact is that I gave Berkshirestock to the sellers of Dexter rather than cash, and the shares I used for the purchase are now worth about $5.7billion. As a financial disaster, this one deserves a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records.\nSeveral of my subsequent errors also involved the use of Berkshire shares to purchase businesses whose\nearnings were destined to simply limp along. Mistakes of that kind are deadly. Trading shares of a wonderfulbusiness – which Berkshire most certainly is – for ownership of a so-so business irreparably destroys value.\nWe’ve also suffered financially when this mistake has been committed by companies whose shares\nBerkshire has owned (with the errors sometimes occurring while I was serving as a director). Too often CEOs seemblind to an elementary reality: The intrinsic value of the shares you give in an acquisition must not be greater thanthe intrinsic value of the business you receive.\n27\n\nI’ve yet to see an investment banker quantify this all-important math when he is presenting a stock-for-\nstock deal to the board of a potential acquirer. Instead, the banker’s focus will be on describing “customary”premiums-to-market-price that are currently being paid for acquisitions – an absolutely asinine way to evaluate theattractiveness of an acquisition – or whether the deal will increase the acquirer’s earnings-per-share (which in itselfshould be far from determinative). In striving to achieve the desired per-share number, a panting CEO and his“helpers” will often conjure up fanciful “synergies.” (As a director of 19 companies over the years, I’ve never heard“dis-synergies” mentioned, though I’ve witnessed plenty of these once deals have closed.) Post mortems ofacquisitions, in which reality is honestly compared to the original projections, are rare in American boardrooms.They should instead be standard practice.\nI can promise you that long after I’m gone, Berkshire’s CEO and Board will carefully make intrinsic value\ncalculations before issuing shares in any acquisitions. You can’t get rich trading a hundred-dollar bill for eight tens(even if your advisor has handed you an expensive “fairness” opinion endorsing that swap).\n************\nOverall, Berkshire’s acquisitions have worked out well – and very well in the case of a few large ones. So,\ntoo, have our investments in marketable securities. The latter are always valued on our balance sheet at their marketprices so any gains – including those unrealized – are immediately reflected in our net worth. But the businesses webuy outright are never revalued upward on our balance sheet, even when we could sell them for many billions ofdollars more than their carrying value. The unrecorded gains in the value of Berkshire’s subsidiaries have becomehuge, with these growing at a particularly fast pace in the last decade.\nListening to Charlie has paid off.\n28\n\nBerkshire Today\nBerkshire is now a sprawling conglomerate, constantly trying to sprawl further.\nConglomerates, it should be acknowledged, have a terrible reputation with investors. And they richly\ndeserve it. Let me first explain why they are in the doghouse, and then I will go on to describe why theconglomerate form brings huge and enduring advantages to Berkshire.\nSince I entered the business world, conglomerates have enjoyed several periods of extreme popularity, the\nsilliest of which occurred in the late 1960s. The drill for conglomerate CEOs then was simple: By personality,promotion or dubious accounting – and often by all three – these managers drove a fledgling conglomerate’s stockto, say, 20 times earnings and then issued shares as fast as possible to acquire another business selling at ten-or-sotimes earnings. They immediately applied “pooling” accounting to the acquisition, which – with not a dime’s worthof change in the underlying businesses – automatically increased per-share earnings, and used the rise as proof ofmanagerial genius. They next explained to investors that this sort of talent justified the maintenance, or even theenhancement, of the acquirer’s p/e multiple. And, finally, they promised to endlessly repeat this procedure andthereby create ever-increasing per-share earnings.\nWall Street’s love affair with this hocus-pocus intensified as the 1960s rolled by. The Street’s denizens are\nalways ready to suspend disbelief when dubious maneuvers are used to manufacture rising per-share earnings,particularly if these acrobatics produce mergers that generate huge fees for investment bankers. Auditors willinglysprinkled their holy water on the conglomerates’ accounting and sometimes even made suggestions as to how tofurther juice the numbers. For many, gushers of easy money washed away ethical sensitivities.\nSince the per-share earnings gains of an expanding conglomerate came from exploiting p/e differences, its\nCEO had to search for businesses selling at low multiples of earnings. These, of course, were characteristicallymediocre businesses with poor long-term prospects. This incentive to bottom-fish usually led to a conglomerate’scollection of underlying businesses becoming more and more junky. That mattered little to investors: It was dealvelocity and pooling accounting they looked to for increased earnings.\nThe resulting firestorm of merger activity was fanned by an adoring press. Companies such as ITT, Litton\nIndustries, Gulf & Western, and LTV were lionized, and their CEOs became celebrities. (These once-famousconglomerates are now long gone. As Yogi Berra said, “Every Napoleon meets his Watergate.”)\nBack then, accounting shenanigans of all sorts – many of them ridiculously transparent – were excused or\noverlooked. Indeed, having an accounting wizard at the helm of an expanding conglomerate was viewed as a hugeplus: Shareholders in those instances could be sure that reported earnings would never disappoint, no matter how\nbad the operating realities of the business might become.\nIn the late 1960s, I attended a meeting at which an acquisitive CEO bragged of his “bold, imaginative\naccounting.” Most of the analysts listening responded with approving nods, seeing themselves as having found amanager whose forecasts were certain to be met, whatever the business results might be.\n29\n\nEventually, however, the clock struck twelve, and everything turned to pumpkins and mice. Once again, it\nbecame evident that business models based on the serial issuances of overpriced shares – just like chain-lettermodels – most assuredly redistribute wealth, but in no way create it. Both phenomena, nevertheless, periodicallyblossom in our country – they are every promoter’s dream – though often they appear in a carefully-crafted disguise.The ending is always the same: Money flows from the gullible to the fraudster. And with stocks, unlike chain letters,the sums hijacked can be staggering.\nAt both BPL and Berkshire, we have never invested in companies that are hell-bent on issuing shares. That\nbehavior is one of the surest indicators of a promotion-minded management, weak accounting, a stock that isoverpriced and – all too often – outright dishonesty.\n************\nSo what do Charlie and I find so attractive about Berkshire’s conglomerate structure? To put the case\nsimply: If the conglomerate form is used judiciously, it is an ideal structure for maximizing long-term capitalgrowth.\nOne of the heralded virtues of capitalism is that it efficiently allocates funds. The argument is that markets\nwill direct investment to promising businesses and deny it to those destined to wither. That is true: With all itsexcesses, market-driven allocation of capital is usually far superior to any alternative.\nNevertheless, there are often obstacles to the rational movement of capital. As those 1954 Berkshire\nminutes made clear, capital withdrawals within the textile industry that should have been obvious were delayed fordecades because of the vain hopes and self-interest of managements. Indeed, I myself delayed abandoning ourobsolete textile mills for far too long.\nA CEO with capital employed in a declining operation seldom elects to massively redeploy that capital into\nunrelated activities. A move of that kind would usually require that long-time associates be fired and mistakes beadmitted. Moreover, it’s unlikely thatCEO would be the manager you would wish to handle the redeployment job\neven if he or she was inclined to undertake it.\nAt the shareholder level, taxes and frictional costs weigh heavily on individual investors when they attempt\nto reallocate capital among businesses and industries. Even tax-free institutional investors face major costs as theymove capital because they usually need intermediaries to do this job. A lot of mouths with expensive tastes thenclamor to be fed – among them investment bankers, accountants, consultants, lawyers and such capital-reallocatorsas leveraged buyout operators. Money-shufflers don’t come cheap.\nIn contrast, a conglomerate such as Berkshire is perfectly positioned to allocate capital rationally and at\nminimal cost. Of course, form itself is no guarantee of success: We have made plenty of mistakes, and we will makemore. Our structural advantages, however, are formidable.\nAt Berkshire, we can – without incurring taxes or much in the way of other costs – move huge sums from\nbusinesses that have limited opportunities for incremental investment to other sectors with greater promise.Moreover, we are free of historical biases created by lifelong association with a given industry and are not subject topressures from colleagues having a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. That’s important: If horses hadcontrolled investment decisions, there would have been no auto industry.\n30\n\nAnother major advantage we possess is the ability to buy pieces of wonderful businesses – a.k.a. common\nstocks. That’s not a course of action open to most managements. Over our history, this strategic alternative hasproved to be very helpful; a broad range of options always sharpens decision-making. The businesses we are offeredby the stock market every day – in small pieces, to be sure – are often far more attractive than the businesses we areconcurrently being offered in their entirety. Additionally, the gains we’ve realized from marketable securities havehelped us make certain large acquisitions that would otherwise have been beyond our financial capabilities.\nIn effect, the world is Berkshire’s oyster – a world offering us a range of opportunities far beyond those\nrealistically open to most companies. We are limited, of course, to businesses whose economic prospects we canevaluate. And that’s a serious limitation: Charlie and I have no idea what a great many companies will look like tenyears from now. But that limitation is much smaller than that borne by an executive whose experience has beenconfined to a single industry. On top of that, we can profitably scale to a farlarger size than the many businesses\nthat are constrained by the limited potential of the single industry in which they operate.\nI mentioned earlier that See’s Candy had produced huge earnings compared to its modest capital\nrequirements. We would have loved, of course, to intelligently use those funds to expand our candy operation. Butour many attempts to do so were largely futile. So, without incurring tax inefficiencies or frictional costs, we haveused the excess funds generated by See’s to help purchase other businesses. If See’s had remained a stand-alonecompany, its earnings would have had to be distributed to investors to redeploy, sometimes after being heavilydepleted by large taxes and, almost always, by significant frictional and agency costs.\n************\nBerkshire has one further advantage that has become increasingly important over the years: We are now the\nhome of choice for the owners and managers of many outstanding businesses.\nFamilies that own successful businesses have multiple options when they contemplate sale. Frequently, the\nbest decision is to do nothing. There are worse things in life than having a prosperous business that one understandswell. But sitting tight is seldom recommended by Wall Street. (Don’t ask the barber whether you need a haircut.)\nWhen one part of a family wishes to sell while others wish to continue, a public offering often makes\nsense. But, when owners wish to cash out entirely, they usually consider one of two paths.\nThe first is sale to a competitor who is salivating at the possibility of wringing “synergies” from the\ncombining of the two companies. This buyer invariably contemplates getting rid of large numbers of the seller’sassociates, the very people who have helped the owner build his business. A caring owner, however – and there areplenty of them – usually does not want to leave his long-time associates sadly singing the old country song: “ She got\nthe goldmine, I got the shaft. ”\nThe second choice for sellers is the Wall Street buyer. For some years, these purchasers accurately called\nthemselves “leveraged buyout firms.” When that term got a bad name in the early 1990s – remember RJR andBarbarians at the Gate ? – these buyers hastily relabeled themselves “private-equity.”\nThe name may have changed but that was all: Equity is dramatically reduced and debt is piled on in\nvirtually all private-equity purchases. Indeed, the amount that a private-equity purchaser offers to the seller is in partdetermined by the buyer assessing the maximum amount of debt that can be placed on the acquired company.\n31\n\nLater, if things go well and equity begins to build, leveraged buy-out shops will often seek to re-leverage\nwith new borrowings. They then typically use part of the proceeds to pay a huge dividend that drives equity sharplydownward, sometimes even to a negative figure.\nIn truth, “equity” is a dirty word for many private-equity buyers; what they love is debt. And, because debt\nis currently so inexpensive, these buyers can frequently pay top dollar. Later, the business will be resold, often toanother leveraged buyer. In effect, the business becomes a piece of merchandise.\nBerkshire offers a third choice to the business owner who wishes to sell: a permanent home, in which the\ncompany’s people and culture will be retained (though, occasionally, management changes will be needed). Beyondthat, any business we acquire dramatically increases its financial strength and ability to grow. Its days of dealingwith banks and Wall Street analysts are also forever ended.\nSome sellers don’t care about these matters. But, when sellers do, Berkshire does not have a lot of\ncompetition.\n************\nSometimes pundits propose that Berkshire spin-off certain of its businesses. These suggestions make no\nsense. Our companies are worth more as part of Berkshire than as separate entities. One reason is our ability tomove funds between businesses or into new ventures instantly and without tax. In addition, certain costs duplicatethemselves, in full or part, if operations are separated. Here’s the most obvious example: Berkshire incurs nominalcosts for its single board of directors; were our dozens of subsidiaries to be split off, the overall cost for directorswould soar. So, too, would regulatory and administration expenditures.\nFinally, there are sometimes important tax efficiencies for Subsidiary A because we own Subsidiary B. For\nexample, certain tax credits that are available to our utilities are currently realizable only because we generate hugeamounts of taxable income at other Berkshire operations. That gives Berkshire Hathaway Energy a major advantageover most public-utility companies in developing wind and solar projects.\nInvestment bankers, being paid as they are for action, constantly urge acquirers to pay 20% to 50%\npremiums over market price for publicly-held businesses. The bankers tell the buyer that the premium is justified for“control value” and for the wonderful things that are going to happen once the acquirer’s CEO takes charge. (Whatacquisition-hungry manager will challenge thatassertion?)\nA few years later, bankers – bearing straight faces – again appear and just as earnestly urge spinning off the\nearlier acquisition in order to “unlock shareholder value.” Spin-offs, of course, strip the owning company of itspurported “control value” without any compensating payment. The bankers explain that the spun-off company willflourish because its management will be more entrepreneurial, having been freed from the smothering bureaucracyof the parent company. (So much for that talented CEO we met earlier.)\nIf the divesting company later wishes to reacquire the spun-off operation, it presumably would again be\nurged by its bankers to pay a hefty “control” premium for the privilege. (Mental “flexibility” of this sort by thebanking fraternity has prompted the saying that fees too often lead to transactions rather than transactions leading tofees.)\nIt’s possible, of course, that someday a spin-off or sale at Berkshire would be required by regulators.\nBerkshire carried out such a spin-off in 1979, when new regulations for bank holding companies forced us to divesta bank we owned in Rockford, Illinois.\n32\n\nVoluntary spin-offs, though, make no sense for us: We would lose control value, capital-allocation\nflexibility and, in some cases, important tax advantages. The CEOs who brilliantly run our subsidiaries now wouldhave difficulty in being as effective if running a spun-off operation, given the operating and financial advantagesderived from Berkshire’s ownership. Moreover, the parent and the spun-off operations, once separated, would likelyincur moderately greater costs than existed when they were combined.\n************\nBefore I depart the subject of spin-offs, let’s look at a lesson to be learned from a conglomerate mentioned\nearlier: LTV. I’ll summarize here, but those who enjoy a good financial story should read the piece about JimmyLing that ran in the October 1982 issue of D Magazine . Look it up on the Internet.\nThrough a lot of corporate razzle-dazzle, Ling had taken LTV from sales of only $36 million in 1965 to\nnumber 14 on the Fortune 500 list just two years later. Ling, it should be noted, had never displayed any managerialskills. But Charlie told me long ago to never underestimate the man who overestimates himself. And Ling had nopeer in that respect.\nLing’s strategy, which he labeled “project redeployment,” was to buy a large company and then partially\nspin off its various divisions. In LTV’s 1966 annual report, he explained the magic that would follow: “Mostimportantly, acquisitions must meet the test of the 2 plus 2 equals 5 (or 6) formula.” The press, the public and WallStreet loved this sort of talk.\nIn 1967 Ling bought Wilson & Co., a huge meatpacker that also had interests in golf equipment and\npharmaceuticals. Soon after, he split the parent into three businesses, Wilson & Co. (meatpacking), Wilson SportingGoods and Wilson Pharmaceuticals, each of which was to be partially spun off. These companies quickly becameknown on Wall Street as Meatball, Golf Ball and Goof Ball.\nSoon thereafter, it became clear that, like Icarus, Ling had flown too close to the sun. By the early 1970s,\nLing’s empire was melting, and he himself had been spun off from LTV . . . that is, fired.\nPeriodically, financial markets will become divorced from reality – you can count on that. More Jimmy\nLings will appear. They will look and sound authoritative. The press will hang on their every word. Bankers willfight for their business. What they are saying will recently have “worked.” Their early followers will be feeling veryclever. Our suggestion: Whatever their line, never forget that 2+2 will always equal 4. And when someone tells youhow old-fashioned that math is --- zip up your wallet, take a vacation and come back in a few years to buy stocks atcheap prices.\n************\nToday Berkshire possesses (1) an unmatched collection of businesses, most of them now enjoying\nfavorable economic prospects; (2) a cadre of outstanding managers who, with few exceptions, are unusually devotedto both the subsidiary they operate andto Berkshire; (3) an extraordinary diversity of earnings, premier financial\nstrength and oceans of liquidity that we will maintain under allcircumstances; (4) a first-choice ranking among\nmany owners and managers who are contemplating sale of their businesses and (5) in a point related to thepreceding item, a culture, distinctive in many ways from that of most large companies, that we have worked 50years to develop and that is now rock-solid.\nThese strengths provide us a wonderful foundation on which to build.\n33\n\nThe Next 50 Years at Berkshire\nNow let’s take a look at the road ahead. Bear in mind that if I had attempted 50 years ago to gauge what\nwas coming, certain of my predictions would have been far off the mark. With that warning, I will tell you what Iwould say to my family today if they asked me about Berkshire’s future.\n‹First and definitely foremost, I believe that the chance of permanent capital loss for patient Berkshireshareholders is as low as can be found among single-company investments. That’s because our per-shareintrinsic business value is almost certain to advance over time.\nThis cheery prediction comes, however, with an important caution: If an investor’s entry point into\nBerkshire stock is unusually high – at a price, say, approaching double book value, which Berkshire shareshave occasionally reached – it may well be many years before the investor can realize a profit. In otherwords, a sound investment can morph into a rash speculation if it is bought at an elevated price. Berkshireis not exempt from this truth.\nPurchases of Berkshire that investors make at a price modestly above the level at which the company\nwould repurchase its shares, however, should produce gains within a reasonable period of time. Berkshire’sdirectors will only authorize repurchases at a price they believe to be well below intrinsic value. (In our\nview, that is an essential criterion for repurchases that is often ignored by other managements.)\nFor those investors who plan to sell within a year or two after their purchase, I can offer noassurances,\nwhatever the entry price. Movements of the general stock market during such abbreviated periods willlikely be far more important in determining your results than the concomitant change in the intrinsic valueof your Berkshire shares. As Ben Graham said many decades ago: “In the short-term the market is a votingmachine; in the long-run it acts as a weighing machine.” Occasionally, the voting decisions of investors –amateurs and professionals alike – border on lunacy.\nSince I know of no way to reliably predict market movements, I recommend that you purchase Berkshire\nshares only if you expect to hold them for at least five years. Those who seek short-term profits should look\nelsewhere.\nAnother warning: Berkshire shares should not be purchased with borrowed money. There have been three\ntimes since 1965 when our stock has fallen about 50% from its high point. Someday, something close tothis kind of drop will happen again, and no one knows when. Berkshire will almost certainly be asatisfactory holding for investors . But it could well be a disastrous choice for speculators employing\nleverage.\n‹I believe the chance of any event causing Berkshire to experience financial problems is essentially zero.We will always be prepared for the thousand-year flood; in fact, if it occurs we will be selling life jacketsto the unprepared. Berkshire played an important role as a “first responder” during the 2008-2009meltdown, and we have since more than doubled the strength of our balance sheet and our earningspotential. Your company is the Gibraltar of American business and will remain so.\nFinancial staying power requires a company to maintain three strengths under allcircumstances: (1) a large\nand reliable stream of earnings; (2) massive liquid assets and (3) nosignificant near-term cash\nrequirements. Ignoring that last necessity is what usually leads companies to experience unexpectedproblems: Too often, CEOs of profitable companies feel they will always be able to refund maturingobligations, however large these are. In 2008-2009, many managements learned how perilous that mindsetcan be.\nHere’s how we will always stand on the three essentials. First, our earnings stream is huge and comes from\na vast array of businesses. Our shareholders now own many large companies that have durable competitiveadvantages, and we will acquire more of those in the future. Our diversification assures Berkshire’scontinued profitability, even if a catastrophe causes insurance losses that far exceed any previouslyexperienced.\n34\n\nNext up is cash. At a healthy business, cash is sometimes thought of as something to be minimized – as an\nunproductive asset that acts as a drag on such markers as return on equity. Cash, though, is to a business asoxygen is to an individual: never thought about when it is present, the only thing in mind when it is absent.\nAmerican business provided a case study of that in 2008. In September of that year, many long-prosperous\ncompanies suddenly wondered whether their checks would bounce in the days ahead. Overnight, theirfinancial oxygen disappeared.\nAt Berkshire, our “breathing” went uninterrupted. Indeed, in a three-week period spanning late September\nand early October, we supplied $15.6 billion of fresh money to American businesses.\nWe could do that because we always maintain at least $20 billion – and usually far more – in cash\nequivalents. And by that we mean U.S. Treasury bills, not other substitutes for cash that are claimed todeliver liquidity and actually do so, except when it is truly needed. When bills come due, only cash is legal\ntender. Don’t leave home without it.\nFinally – getting to our third point – we will never engage in operating or investment practices that can\nresult in sudden demands for large sums. That means we will not expose Berkshire to short-term debtmaturities of size nor enter into derivative contracts or other business arrangements that could require largecollateral calls.\nSome years ago, we became a party to certain derivative contracts that we believed were significantly\nmispriced and that had only minor collateral requirements. These have proved to be quite profitable.Recently, however, newly-written derivative contracts have required full collateralization. And that endedour interest in derivatives, regardless of what profit potential they might offer. We have not, for someyears, written these contracts, except for a few needed for operational purposes at our utility businesses.\nMoreover, we will not write insurance contracts that give policyholders the right to cash out at their option.\nMany lifeinsurance products contain redemption features that make them susceptible to a “run” in times of\nextreme panic. Contracts of that sort, however, do not exist in the property-casualty world that we inhabit. Ifour premium volume should shrink, our float would decline – but only at a very slow pace.\nThe reason for our conservatism, which may impress some people as extreme, is that it is entirely\npredictable that people will occasionally panic, but not at all predictable when this will happen. Thoughpractically all days are relatively uneventful, tomorrow is always uncertain. (I felt no special apprehension\non December 6, 1941 or September 10, 2001.) And if you can’t predict what tomorrow will bring, youmust be prepared for whatever it does.\nA CEO who is 64 and plans to retire at 65 may have his own special calculus in evaluating risks that have\nonly a tiny chance of happening in a given year. He may, in fact, be “right” 99% of the time. Those odds,however, hold no appeal for us. We will never play financial Russian roulette with the funds you’veentrusted to us, even if the metaphorical gun has 100 chambers and only one bullet. In our view, it ismadness to risk losing what you need in pursuing what you simply desire .\n‹Despite our conservatism, I think we will be able every year to build the underlying per-share earning\npower of Berkshire. That does notmean operating earnings will increase each year – far from it. The U.S.\neconomy will ebb and flow – though mostly flow – and, when it weakens, so will our current earnings. Butwe will continue to achieve organic gains, make bolt-on acquisitions and enter new fields. I believe,therefore, that Berkshire will annually add to its underlying earning power.\nIn some years the gains will be substantial, and at other times they will be minor. Markets, competition,\nand chance will determine when opportunities come our way. Through it all, Berkshire will keep movingforward, powered by the array of solid businesses we now possess and the new companies we willpurchase. In most years, moreover, our country’s economy will provide a strong tailwind for business. Weare blessed to have the United States as our home field.\n35\n\n‹The bad news is that Berkshire’s long-term gains – measured by percentages, not by dollars – cannot be\ndramatic and will not come close to those achieved in the past 50 years. The numbers have become too big.\nI think Berkshire will outperform the average American company, but our advantage, if any, won’t begreat.\nEventually – probably between ten and twenty years from now – Berkshire’s earnings and capital resources\nwill reach a level that will not allow management to intelligently reinvest all of the company’s earnings. Atthat time our directors will need to determine whether the best method to distribute the excess earnings isthrough dividends, share repurchases or both. If Berkshire shares are selling below intrinsic business value,massive repurchases will almost certainly be the best choice. You can be comfortable that your directorswill make the right decision.\n‹No company will be more shareholder-minded than Berkshire. For more than 30 years, we have annuallyreaffirmed our Shareholder Principles (see page 117), always leading off with: “Although our form iscorporate, our attitude is partnership.” This covenant with you is etched in stone.\nWe have an extraordinarily knowledgeable and business-oriented board of directors ready to carry out that\npromise of partnership. None took the job for the money: In an arrangement almost non-existent elsewhere,our directors are paid only token fees. They receive their rewards instead through ownership of Berkshireshares and the satisfaction that comes from being good stewards of an important enterprise.\nThe shares that they and their families own – which, in many cases, are worth very substantial sums – were\npurchased in the market (rather than their materializing through options or grants). In addition, unlike\nalmost all other sizable public companies, we carry no directors and officers liability insurance. AtBerkshire, directors walk in your shoes.\nTo further ensure continuation of our culture, I have suggested that my son, Howard, succeed me as a non-\nexecutive Chairman. My only reason for this wish is to make change easier if the wrong CEO should ever\nbe employed and there occurs a need for the Chairman to move forcefully. I can assure you that thisproblem has a very low probability of arising at Berkshire – likely as low as at any public company. In my\nservice on the boards of nineteen public companies, however, I’ve seen how hard it is to replace a mediocreCEO if that person is also Chairman. (The deed usually gets done, but almost always very late.)\nIf elected, Howard will receive no pay and will spend no time at the job other than that required of all\ndirectors. He will simply be a safety valve to whom any director can go if he or she has concerns about theCEO and wishes to learn if other directors are expressing doubts as well. Should multiple directors beapprehensive, Howard’s chairmanship will allow the matter to be promptly and properly addressed.\n‹Choosing the right CEO is all-important and is a subject that commands much time at Berkshire boardmeetings. Managing Berkshire is primarily a job of capital allocation, coupled with the selection andretention of outstanding managers to captain our operating subsidiaries. Obviously, the job also requires thereplacement of a subsidiary’s CEO when that is called for. These duties require Berkshire’s CEO to be arational, calm and decisive individual who has a broad understanding of business and good insights intohuman behavior. It’s important as well that he knows his limits. (As Tom Watson, Sr. of IBM said, “I’m nogenius, but I’m smart in spots and I stay around those spots.”)\nCharacter is crucial: A Berkshire CEO must be “all in” for the company, not for himself. (I’m using male\npronouns to avoid awkward wording, but gender should never decide who becomes CEO.) He can’t helpbut earn money far in excess of any possible need for it. But it’s important that neither ego nor avaricemotivate him to reach for pay matching his most lavishly-compensated peers, even if his achievements farexceed theirs. A CEO’s behavior has a huge impact on managers down the line: If it’s clear to them thatshareholders’ interests are paramount to him, they will, with few exceptions, also embrace that way ofthinking.\n36\n\nMy successor will need one other particular strength: the ability to fight off the ABCs of business decay,\nwhich are arrogance, bureaucracy and complacency. When these corporate cancers metastasize, even thestrongest of companies can falter. The examples available to prove the point are legion, but to maintainfriendships I will exhume only cases from the distant past.\nIn their glory days, General Motors, IBM, Sears Roebuck and U.S. Steel sat atop huge industries. Their\nstrengths seemed unassailable. But the destructive behavior I deplored above eventually led each of them tofall to depths that their CEOs and directors had not long before thought impossible. Their one-timefinancial strength and their historical earning power proved no defense.\nOnly a vigilant and determined CEO can ward off such debilitating forces as Berkshire grows ever larger.\nHe must never forget Charlie’s plea: “Tell me where I’m going to die, so I’ll never go there.” If our non-economic values were to be lost, much of Berkshire’s economic value would collapse as well. “Tone at thetop” will be key to maintaining Berkshire’s special culture.\nFortunately, the structure our future CEOs will need to be successful is firmly in place. The extraordinary\ndelegation of authority now existing at Berkshire is the ideal antidote to bureaucracy. In an operating sense,Berkshire is not a giant company but rather a collection of large companies. At headquarters, we havenever had a committee nor have we ever required our subsidiaries to submit budgets (though many usethem as an important internal tool). We don’t have a legal office nor departments that other companies takefor granted: human relations, public relations, investor relations, strategy, acquisitions, you name it.\nWe do, of course, have an active audit function; no sense being a damned fool. To an unusual degree,\nhowever, we trust our managers to run their operations with a keen sense of stewardship. After all, theywere doing exactly that before we acquired their businesses. With only occasional exceptions, furthermore,our trust produces better results than would be achieved by streams of directives, endless reviews andlayers of bureaucracy. Charlie and I try to interact with our managers in a manner consistent with what wewould wish for, if the positions were reversed.\n‹Our directors believe that our future CEOs should come from internal candidates whom the Berkshireboard has grown to know well. Our directors also believe that an incoming CEO should be relativelyyoung, so that he or she can have a long run in the job. Berkshire will operate best if its CEOs average wellover ten years at the helm. (It’s hard to teach a new dog old tricks.) And they are not likely to retire at 65either (or have you noticed?).\nIn both Berkshire’s business acquisitions and large, tailored investment moves, it is important that our\ncounterparties be both familiar with and feel comfortable with Berkshire’s CEO. Developing confidence ofthat sort and cementing relationships takes time. The payoff, though, can be huge.\nBoth the board and I believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO – a successor ready to\nassume the job the day after I die or step down. In certain important respects, this person will do a betterjob than I am doing.\n‹Investments will always be of great importance to Berkshire and will be handled by several specialists.They will report to the CEO because their investment decisions, in a broad way, will need to becoordinated with Berkshire’s operating and acquisition programs. Overall, though, our investmentmanagers will enjoy great autonomy. In this area, too, we are in fine shape for decades to come. ToddCombs and Ted Weschler, each of whom has spent several years on Berkshire’s investment team, are first-rate in all respects and can be of particular help to the CEO in evaluating acquisitions.\nAll told, Berkshire is ideally positioned for life after Charlie and I leave the scene. We have the right\npeople in place – the right directors, managers and prospective successors to those managers. Our culture,furthermore, is embedded throughout their ranks. Our system is also regenerative. To a large degree, bothgood and bad cultures self-select to perpetuate themselves. For very good reasons, business owners andoperating managers with values similar to ours will continue to be attracted to Berkshire as a one-of-a-kindandpermanent home.\n37\n\n‹I would be remiss if I didn’t salute another key constituency that makes Berkshire special: our shareholders.\nBerkshire truly has an owner base unlike that of any other giant corporation. That fact was demonstrated inspades at last year’s annual meeting, where the shareholders were offered a proxy resolution:\nRESOLVED: Whereas the corporation has more money than it needs and since the owners unlike\nWarren are not multi billionaires, the board shall consider paying a meaningful annual dividend onthe shares.\nThe sponsoring shareholder of that resolution never showed up at the meeting, so his motion was not\nofficially proposed. Nevertheless, the proxy votes had been tallied, and they were enlightening.\nNot surprisingly, the A shares – owned by relatively few shareholders, each with a large economic interest\n– voted “no” on the dividend question by a margin of 89 to 1.\nThe remarkable vote was that of our B shareholders. They number in the hundreds of thousands – perhaps\neven totaling one million – and they voted 660,759,855 “no” and 13,927,026 “yes,” a ratio of about 47 to 1.\nOur directors recommended a “no” vote but the company did not otherwise attempt to influence\nshareholders. Nevertheless, 98% of the shares voting said, in effect, “Don’t send us a dividend but insteadreinvest all of the earnings.” To have our fellow owners – large and small – be so in sync with ourmanagerial philosophy is both remarkable and rewarding.\nI am a lucky fellow to have you as partners.\nWarren E. Buffett\n38\n\nVice Chairman’s Thoughts – Past and Future\nTo the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:I closely watched the 50-year history of Berkshire’s uncommon success under Warren Buffett. And it now seems\nappropriate that I independently supplement whatever celebratory comment comes from him. I will try to do fivethings.\n(1) Describe the management system and policies that caused a small and unfixably-doomed commodity\ntextile business to morph into the mighty Berkshire that now exists,\n(2) Explain how the management system and policies came into being,(3) Explain, to some extent, why Berkshire did so well,(4) Predict whether abnormally good results would continue if Buffett were soon to depart, and(5) Consider whether Berkshire’s great results over the last 50 years have implications that may prove useful\nelsewhere.\nThe management system and policies of Berkshire under Buffett (herein together called “the Berkshire system”)\nwere fixed early and are described below:\n(1) Berkshire would be a diffuse conglomerate, averse only to activities about which it could not make useful\npredictions.\n(2) Its top company would do almost all business through separately incorporated subsidiaries whose CEOs\nwould operate with very extreme autonomy.\n(3) There would be almost nothing at conglomerate headquarters except a tiny office suite containing a\nChairman, a CFO, and a few assistants who mostly helped the CFO with auditing, internal control, etc.\n(4) Berkshire subsidiaries would always prominently include casualty insurers. Those insurers as a group\nwould be expected to produce, in due course, dependable underwriting gains while also producingsubstantial “float” (from unpaid insurance liabilities) for investment.\n(5) There would be no significant system-wide personnel system, stock option system, other incentive system,\nretirement system, or the like, because the subsidiaries would have their own systems, often different.\n(6) Berkshire’s Chairman would reserve only a few activities for himself.\n(i) He would manage almost all security investments, with these normally residing in Berkshire’s\ncasualty insurers.\n(ii) He would choose all CEOs of important subsidiaries, and he would fix their compensation and\nobtain from each a private recommendation for a successor in case one was suddenly needed.\n(iii) He would deploy most cash not needed in subsidiaries after they had increased their competitive\nadvantage, with the ideal deployment being the use of that cash to acquire new subsidiaries.\n(iv) He would make himself promptly available for almost any contact wanted by any subsidiary’s\nCEO, and he would require almost no additional contact.\n(v) He would write a long, logical, and useful letter for inclusion in his annual report, designed as he\nwould wish it to be if he were only a passive shareholder, and he would be available for hours ofanswering questions at annual shareholders’ meetings.\n(vi) He would try to be an exemplar in a culture that would work well for customers, shareholders,\nand other incumbents for a long time, both before and after his departure.\n(vii) His first priority would be reservation of much time for quiet reading and thinking, particularly\nthat which might advance his determined learning, no matter how old he became; and\n39\n\n(viii) He would also spend much time in enthusiastically admiring what others were accomplishing.\n(7) New subsidiaries would usually be bought with cash, not newly issued stock.(8) Berkshire would not pay dividends so long as more than one dollar of market value for shareholders was\nbeing created by each dollar of retained earnings.\n(9) In buying a new subsidiary, Berkshire would seek to pay a fair price for a good business that the Chairman\ncould pretty well understand. Berkshire would also want a good CEO in place, one expected to remain for along time and to manage well without need for help from headquarters.\n(10) In choosing CEOs of subsidiaries, Berkshire would try to secure trustworthiness, skill, energy, and love for\nthe business and circumstances the CEO was in.\n(11) As an important matter of preferred conduct, Berkshire would almost never sell a subsidiary.(12) Berkshire would almost never transfer a subsidiary’s CEO to another unrelated subsidiary.(13) Berkshire would never force the CEO of a subsidiary to retire on account of mere age.(14) Berkshire would have little debt outstanding as it tried to maintain (i) virtually perfect creditworthiness\nunder all conditions and (ii) easy availability of cash and credit for deployment in times presenting unusualopportunities.\n(15) Berkshire would always be user-friendly to a prospective seller of a large business. An offer of such a\nbusiness would get prompt attention. No one but the Chairman and one or two others at Berkshire wouldever know about the offer if it did not lead to a transaction. And they would never tell outsiders about it.\nBoth the elements of the Berkshire system and their collected size are quite unusual. No other large corporation I\nknow of has half of such elements in place.\nHow did Berkshire happen to get a corporate personality so different from the norm?Well, Buffett, even when only 34 years old, controlled about 45% of Berkshire’s shares and was completely trusted\nby all the other big shareholders. He could install whatever system he wanted. And he did so, creating the Berkshiresystem.\nAlmost every element was chosen because Buffett believed that, under him, it would help maximize Berkshire’s\nachievement. He was not trying to create a one-type-fits-all system for other corporations. Indeed, Berkshire’ssubsidiaries were not required to use the Berkshire system in their own operations. And some flourished while usingdifferent systems.\nWhat was Buffett aiming at as he designed the Berkshire system?Well, over the years I diagnosed several important themes:\n(1) He particularly wanted continuous maximization of the rationality, skills, and devotion of the most\nimportant people in the system, starting with himself.\n(2) He wanted win/win results everywhere--in gaining loyalty by giving it, for instance.(3) He wanted decisions that maximized long-term results, seeking these from decision makers who usually\nstayed long enough in place to bear the consequences of decisions.\n(4) He wanted to minimize the bad effects that would almost inevitably come from a large bureaucracy at\nheadquarters.\n(5) He wanted to personally contribute, like Professor Ben Graham, to the spread of wisdom attained.\nWhen Buffett developed the Berkshire system, did he foresee all the benefits that followed? No. Buffett stumbled into\nsome benefits through practice evolution. But, when he saw useful consequences, he strengthened their causes.\n40\n\nWhy did Berkshire under Buffett do so well?\nOnly four large factors occur to me:\n(1) The constructive peculiarities of Buffett,\n(2) The constructive peculiarities of the Berkshire system,(3) Good luck, and(4) The weirdly intense, contagious devotion of some shareholders and other admirers, including some in the\npress.\nI believe all four factors were present and helpful. But the heavy freight was carried by the constructive\npeculiarities, the weird devotion, and their interactions.\nIn particular, Buffett’s decision to limit his activities to a few kinds and to maximize his attention to them, and to\nkeep doing so for 50 years, was a lollapalooza. Buffett succeeded for the same reason Roger Federer became goodat tennis.\nBuffett was, in effect, using the winning method of the famous basketball coach, John Wooden, who won most\nregularly after he had learned to assign virtually all playing time to his seven best players. That way, opponentsalways faced his best players, instead of his second best. And, with the extra playing time, the best players improvedmore than was normal.\nAnd Buffett much out-Woodened Wooden, because in his case the exercise of skill was concentrated in one person,\nnot seven, and his skill improved and improved as he got older and older during 50 years, instead of deterioratinglike the skill of a basketball player does.\nMoreover, by concentrating so much power and authority in the often-long-serving CEOs of important subsidiaries,\nBuffett was also creating strong Wooden-type effects there. And such effects enhanced the skills of the CEOs andthe achievements of the subsidiaries.\nThen, as the Berkshire system bestowed much-desired autonomy on many subsidiaries and their CEOs, and\nBerkshire became successful and well known, these outcomes attracted both more and better subsidiaries intoBerkshire, and better CEOs as well.\nAnd the better subsidiaries and CEOs then required less attention from headquarters, creating what is often called a\n“virtuous circle.”\nHow well did it work out for Berkshire to always include casualty insurers as important subsidiaries?Marvelously well. Berkshire’s ambitions were unreasonably extreme and, even so, it got what it wanted.Casualty insurers often invest in common stocks with a value amounting roughly to their shareholders’ equity, as\ndid Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries. And the S&P 500 Index produced about 10% per annum, pre-tax, during thelast 50 years, creating a significant tailwind.\nAnd, in the early decades of the Buffett era, common stocks within Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries greatly\noutperformed the index, exactly as Buffett expected. And, later, when both the large size of Berkshire’sstockholdings and income tax considerations caused the index-beating part of returns to fade to insignificance(perhaps not forever), other and better advantage came. Ajit Jain created out of nothing an immense reinsurancebusiness that produced both a huge “float” and a large underwriting gain. And all of GEICO came into Berkshire,followed by a quadrupling of GEICO’s market share. And the rest of Berkshire’s insurance operations hugelyimproved, largely by dint of reputational advantage, underwriting discipline, finding and staying within good niches,and recruiting and holding outstanding people.\n41\n\nThen, later, as Berkshire’s nearly unique and quite dependable corporate personality and large size became well\nknown, its insurance subsidiaries got and seized many attractive opportunities, not available to others, to buyprivately issued securities. Most of these securities had fixed maturities and produced outstanding results.\nBerkshire’s marvelous outcome in insurance was not a natural result. Ordinarily, a casualty insurance business is a\nproducer of mediocre results, even when very well managed. And such results are of little use. Berkshire’s betteroutcome was so astoundingly large that I believe that Buffett would now fail to recreate it if he returned to a smallbase while retaining his smarts and regaining his youth.\nDid Berkshire suffer from being a diffuse conglomerate? No, its opportunities were usefully enlarged by a widened\narea for operation. And bad effects, common elsewhere, were prevented by Buffett’s skills.\nWhy did Berkshire prefer to buy companies with cash, instead of its own stock? Well, it was hard to get anything in\nexchange for Berkshire stock that was as valuable as what was given up.\nWhy did Berkshire’s acquisition of companies outside the insurance business work out so well for Berkshire\nshareholders when the normal result in such acquisitions is bad for shareholders of the acquirer?\nWell, Berkshire, by design, had methodological advantages to supplement its better opportunities. It never had the\nequivalent of a “department of acquisitions” under pressure to buy. And it never relied on advice from “helpers”sure to be prejudiced in favor of transactions. And Buffett held self-delusion at bay as he underclaimed expertisewhile he knew better than most corporate executives what worked and what didn’t in business, aided by his longexperience as a passive investor. And, finally, even when Berkshire was getting much better opportunities than mostothers, Buffett often displayed almost inhuman patience and seldom bought. For instance, during his first ten yearsin control of Berkshire, Buffett saw one business (textiles) move close to death and two new businesses come in, fora net gain of one.\nWhat were the big mistakes made by Berkshire under Buffett? Well, while mistakes of commission were common,\nalmost all huge errors were in not making a purchase, including not purchasing Walmart stock when that was sure towork out enormously well. The errors of omission were of much importance. Berkshire’s net worth would now be atleast $50 billion higher if it had seized several opportunities it was not quite smart enough to recognize as virtuallysure things.\nThe next to last task on my list was: Predict whether abnormally good results would continue at Berkshire if Buffett\nwere soon to depart.\nThe answer is yes. Berkshire has in place in its subsidiaries much business momentum grounded in much durable\ncompetitive advantage.\nMoreover, its railroad and utility subsidiaries now provide much desirable opportunity to invest large sums in new\nfixed assets. And many subsidiaries are now engaged in making wise “bolt-on” acquisitions.\nProvided that most of the Berkshire system remains in place, the combined momentum and opportunity now present\nis so great that Berkshire would almost surely remain a better-than-normal company for a very long time even if(1) Buffett left tomorrow, (2) his successors were persons of only moderate ability, and (3) Berkshire never againpurchased a large business.\nBut, under this Buffett-soon-leaves assumption, his successors would not be “of only moderate ability.” For\ninstance, Ajit Jain and Greg Abel are proven performers who would probably be under-described as “world-class.”“World-leading” would be the description I would choose. In some important ways, each is a better businessexecutive than Buffett.\nAnd I believe neither Jain nor Abel would (1) leave Berkshire, no matter what someone else offered or (2) desire\nmuch change in the Berkshire system.\n42\n\nNor do I think that desirable purchases of new businesses would end with Buffett’s departure. With Berkshire now\nso large and the age of activism upon us, I think some desirable acquisition opportunities will come and thatBerkshire’s $60 billion in cash will constructively decrease.\nMy final task was to consider whether Berkshire’s great results over the last 50 years have implications that may\nprove useful elsewhere.\nThe answer is plainly yes. In its early Buffett years, Berkshire had a big task ahead: turning a tiny stash into a large\nand useful company. And it solved that problem by avoiding bureaucracy and relying much on one thoughtful leaderfor a long, long time as he kept improving and brought in more people like himself.\nCompare this to a typical big-corporation system with much bureaucracy at headquarters and a long succession of\nCEOs who come in at about age 59, pause little thereafter for quiet thought, and are soon forced out by a fixedretirement age.\nI believe that versions of the Berkshire system should be tried more often elsewhere and that the worst attributes of\nbureaucracy should much more often be treated like the cancers they so much resemble. A good example ofbureaucracy fixing was created by George Marshall when he helped win World War II by getting from Congress theright to ignore seniority in choosing generals.\nSincerely,Charles T. Munger\n43",

Starting in 1979,\naccounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market rather than at the lower of cost or market, which waspreviously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire’s results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects ,\nthe results are calculated using the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax .I fa\ncorporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return. Over theyears, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n2\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshire’s gain in net worth during 2015 was $15.4 billion, which increased the per-share book value of\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 6.4%. Over the last 51 years (that is, since present management took over),per-share book value has grown from $19 to $155,501, a rate of 19.2% compounded annually.*\nDuring the first half of those years, Berkshire’s net worth was roughly equal to the number that really\ncounts: the intrinsic value of the business. The similarity of the two figures existed then because most of ourresources were deployed in marketable securities that were regularly revalued to their quoted prices (less the tax thatwould be incurred if they were to be sold). In Wall Street parlance, our balance sheet was then in very large part“marked to market.”\nBy the early 1990s, however, our focus had changed to the outright ownership of businesses, a shift that\ndiminished the relevance of balance-sheet figures. That disconnect occurred because the accounting rules that applyto controlled companies are materially different from those used in valuing marketable securities. The carryingvalue of the “losers” we own is written down, but “winners” are never revalued upwards.\nWe’ve had experience with both outcomes: I’ve made some dumb purchases, and the amount I paid for the\neconomic goodwill of those companies was later written off, a move that reduced Berkshire’s book value. We’vealso had some winners – a few of them very big – but have not written those up by a penny.\nOver time, this asymmetrical accounting treatment (with which we agree) necessarily widens the gap\nbetween intrinsic value and book value. Today, the large – and growing – unrecorded gains at our “winners” make itclear that Berkshire’s intrinsic value farexceeds its book value. That’s why we would be delighted to repurchase\nour shares should they sell as low as 120% of book value. At that level, purchases would instantly and meaningfullyincrease per-share intrinsic value for Berkshire’s continuing shareholders.\nThe unrecorded increase in the value of our owned businesses explains why Berkshire’s aggregate market-\nvalue gain – tabulated on the facing page – materially exceeds our book-value gain. The two indicators varyerratically over short periods. Last year, for example, book-value performance was superior. Over time, however,market-value gains should continue their historical tendency to exceed gains in book value.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500\nthof\nthose shown for A.\n3\n\nThe Year at Berkshire\nCharlie Munger, Berkshire Vice Chairman and my partner, and I expect Berkshire’s normalized earning\npower to increase every year. ( Actual year-to-year earnings, of course, will sometimes decline because of weakness\nin the U.S. economy or, possibly, because of insurance mega-catastrophes.) In some years the normalized gains will\nbe small; at other times they will be material. Last year was a good one. Here are the highlights:\n‹ The most important development at Berkshire during 2015 was not financial, though it led to betterearnings. After a poor performance in 2014, our BNSF railroad dramatically improved its service tocustomers last year. To attain that result, we invested about $5.8 billion during the year in capitalexpenditures, a sum far and away the record for any American railroad and nearly three times our annualdepreciation charge. It was money well spent.\nBNSF moves about 17% of America’s intercity freight (measured by revenue ton-miles), whether\ntransported by rail, truck, air, water or pipeline. In that respect, we are a strong number one among theseven large American railroads (two of which are Canadian-based), carrying 45% more ton-miles of freightthan our closest competitor. Consequently, our maintaining first-class service is not only vital to ourshippers’ welfare but also important to the smooth functioning of the U.S. economy.\nFor most American railroads, 2015 was a disappointing year. Aggregate ton-miles fell, and earnings\nweakened as well. BNSF, however, maintained volume, and pre-tax income rose to a record $6.8 billion*(a gain of $606 million from 2014). Matt Rose and Carl Ice, the managers of BNSF, have my thanks anddeserve yours.\n‹ BNSF is the largest of our “Powerhouse Five,” a group that also includes Berkshire Hathaway Energy,Marmon, Lubrizol and IMC. Combined, these companies – our five most profitable non-insurancebusinesses – earned $13.1 billion in 2015, an increase of $650 million over 2014.\nOf the five, only Berkshire Hathaway Energy, then earning $393 million, was owned by us in 2003.\nSubsequently, we purchased three of the other four on an all-cash basis. In acquiring BNSF, however, wepaid about 70% of the cost in cash and, for the remainder, issued Berkshire shares that increased thenumber outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $12.7 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshireby the five companies over the twelve-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. Thatsatisfies our goal of not simply increasing earnings, but making sure we also increase per-share results.\n‹ Next year, I will be discussing the “Powerhouse Six.” The newcomer will be Precision Castparts Corp.(“PCC”), a business that we purchased a month ago for more than $32 billion of cash. PCC fits perfectlyinto the Berkshire model and will substantially increase our normalized per-share earning power.\nUnder CEO Mark Donegan, PCC has become the world’s premier supplier of aerospace components (mostof them destined to be original equipment, though spares are important to the company as well). Mark’saccomplishments remind me of the magic regularly performed by Jacob Harpaz at IMC, our remarkableIsraeli manufacturer of cutting tools. The two men transform very ordinary raw materials into extraordinaryproducts that are used by major manufacturers worldwide. Each is the da Vinci of his craft.\nPCC’s products, often delivered under multi-year contracts, are key components in most large aircraft.\nOther industries are served as well by the company’s 30,466 employees, who work out of 162 plants in 13countries. In building his business, Mark has made many acquisitions and will make more. We lookforward to having him deploy Berkshire’s capital.\n* Throughout this letter, all earnings are stated on a pre-tax basis unless otherwise designated.\n4\n\nA personal thank-you: The PCC acquisition would not have happened without the input and assistance of\nour own Todd Combs, who brought the company to my attention a few years ago and went on to educateme about both the business and Mark. Though Todd and Ted Weschler are primarily investment managers– they each handle about $9 billion for us – both of them cheerfully and ably add major value to Berkshirein other ways as well. Hiring these two was one of my best moves.\n‹With the PCC acquisition, Berkshire will own 101⁄4companies that would populate the Fortune 500 if they\nwere stand-alone businesses. (Our 27% holding of Kraft Heinz is the1⁄4.) That leaves just under 98% of\nAmerica’s business giants that have yet to call us. Operators are standing by.\n‹Our many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $5.7 billion last year, up from $5.1 billion in2014. Within this group, we have one company that last year earned more than $700 million, two thatearned between $400 million and $700 million, seven that earned between $250 million and $400 million,six that earned between $100 million and $250 million, and eleven that earned between $50 million and$100 million. We love them all: This collection of businesses will expand both in number and earnings asthe years go by.\n‹When you hear talk about America’s crumbling infrastructure, rest assured that they’re not talking aboutBerkshire. We invested $16 billion in property, plant and equipment last year, a full 86% of it deployed inthe United States.\nI told you earlier about BNSF’s record capital expenditures in 2015. At the end of every year, our railroad’s\nphysical facilities will be improved from those existing twelve months earlier.\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) is a similar story. That company has invested $16 billion in\nrenewables and now owns 7% of the country’s wind generation and 6% of its solar generation. Indeed, the4,423 megawatts of wind generation owned and operated by our regulated utilities is sixtimes the\ngeneration of the runner-up utility.\nWe’re not done. Last year, BHE made major commitments to the future development of renewables in\nsupport of the Paris Climate Change Conference. Our fulfilling those promises will make great sense, bothfor the environment and for Berkshire’s economics.\n‹Berkshire’s huge and growing insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2015 – thatmakes 13 years in a row – and increased its float. During those years, our float – money that doesn’t belongto us but that we can invest for Berkshire’s benefit – grew from $41 billion to $88 billion. Though neitherthat gain nor the size of our float is reflected in Berkshire’s earnings, float generates significant investmentincome because of the assets it allows us to hold.\nMeanwhile, our underwriting profit totaled $26 billion during the 13-year period, including $1.8 billion\nearned in 2015. Without a doubt, Berkshire’s largest unrecorded wealth lies in its insurance business.We’ve spent 48 years building this multi-faceted operation, and it can’t be replicated.\n‹While Charlie and I search for new businesses to buy, our many subsidiaries are regularly making bolt-onacquisitions. Last year we contracted for 29 bolt-ons, scheduled to cost $634 million in aggregate. The costof these purchases ranged from $300,000 to $143 million.\nCharlie and I encourage bolt-ons, ifthey are sensibly-priced. (Most deals offered us most definitely aren’t.)\nThese purchases deploy capital in operations that fit with our existing businesses and that will be managedby our corps of expert managers. That means no additional work for us, yet more earnings for Berkshire, acombination we find highly appealing. We will make many dozens of bolt-on deals in future years.\n5\n\n‹Our Heinz partnership with Jorge Paulo Lemann, Alex Behring and Bernardo Hees more than doubled its\nsize last year by merging with Kraft. Before this transaction, we owned about 53% of Heinz at a cost of$4.25 billion. Now we own 325.4 million shares of Kraft Heinz (about 27%) that cost us $9.8 billion. Thenew company has annual sales of $27 billion and can supply you Heinz ketchup or mustard to go with yourOscar Mayer hot dogs that come from the Kraft side. Add a Coke, and you will be enjoying my favoritemeal. (We will have the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile at the annual meeting – bring your kids.)\nThough we sold no Kraft Heinz shares, “GAAP” (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) required us\nto record a $6.8 billion write-up of our investment upon completion of the merger. That leaves us with ourKraft Heinz holding carried on our balance sheet at a value many billions above our cost and many billionsbelow its market value, an outcome only an accountant could love.\nBerkshire also owns Kraft Heinz preferred shares that pay us $720 million annually and are carried at $7.7\nbillion on our balance sheet. That holding will almost certainly be redeemed for $8.32 billion in June (theearliest date allowed under the preferred’s terms). That will be good news for Kraft Heinz and bad news forBerkshire.\nJorge Paulo and his associates could not be better partners. We share with them a passion to buy, build and\nhold large businesses that satisfy basic needs and desires. We follow different paths, however, in pursuing\nthis goal.\nTheir method, at which they have been extraordinarily successful, is to buy companies that offer an\nopportunity for eliminating many unnecessary costs and then – very promptly – to make the moves that will\nget the job done. Their actions significantly boost productivity, the all-important factor in America’seconomic growth over the past 240 years. Without more output of desired goods and services per workinghour – that’s the measure of productivity gains – an economy inevitably stagnates. At much of corporateAmerica, truly major gains in productivity are possible, a fact offering opportunities to Jorge Paulo and hisassociates .\nAt Berkshire, we, too, crave efficiency and detest bureaucracy. To achieve our goals, however, we follow\nan approach emphasizing avoidance of bloat, buying businesses such as PCC that have long been run by\ncost-conscious and efficient managers. After the purchase, ourrole is simply to create an environment in\nwhich these CEOs – and their eventual successors, who typically are like-minded – can maximize boththeir managerial effectiveness and the pleasure they derive from their jobs. (With this hands-off style, I amheeding a well-known Mungerism: “If you want to guarantee yourself a lifetime of misery, be sure tomarry someone with the intent of changing their behavior.”)\nWe will continue to operate with extreme – indeed, almost unheard of – decentralization at Berkshire. But\nwe will also look for opportunities to partner with Jorge Paulo, either as a financing partner, as was thecase when his group purchased Tim Horton’s, or as a combined equity-and-financing partner, as at Heinz.We also may occasionally partner with others, as we have successfully done at Berkadia.\nBerkshire, however, will join only with partners making friendly acquisitions. To be sure, certain hostile\noffers are justified: Some CEOs forget that it is shareholders for whom they should be working, while othermanagers are woefully inept. In either case, directors may be blind to the problem or simply reluctant tomake the change required. That’s when new faces are needed. We, though, will leave these “opportunities”for others. At Berkshire, we go only where we are welcome.\n6\n\n‹Berkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its “Big Four” investments – American\nExpress, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. We purchased additional shares of IBM (increasing ourownership to 8.4% versus 7.8% at yearend 2014) and Wells Fargo (going to 9.8% from 9.4%). At the othertwo companies, Coca-Cola and American Express, stock repurchases raised our percentage ownership. Ourequity in Coca-Cola grew from 9.2% to 9.3%, and our interest in American Express increased from 14.8%to 15.6%. In case you think these seemingly small changes aren’t important, consider this math: For thefour companies in aggregate, each increase of one percentage point in our ownership raises Berkshire’sportion of their annual earnings by about $500 million.\nThese four investees possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and\nshareholder-oriented. Their returns on tangible equity range from excellent to staggering. At Berkshire, wemuch prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of a wonderful company to owning 100% ofa so-so business. It’s better to have a partial interest in the Hope Diamond than to own all of a rhinestone.\nIf Berkshire’s yearend holdings are used as the marker, our portion of the “Big Four’s” 2015 earnings\namounted to $4.7 billion. In the earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends theypay us – about $1.8 billion last year. But make no mistake: The nearly $3 billion of these companies’earnings we don’t report are every bit as valuable to us as the portion Berkshire records.\nThe earnings our investees retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock – a move that increases\nBerkshire’s share of future earnings without requiring us to lay out a dime. The retained earnings of thesecompanies also fund business opportunities that usually turn out to be advantageous. All that leads us toexpect that the per-share earnings of these four investees, in aggregate, will grow substantially over time. Ifgains do indeed materialize, dividends to Berkshire will increase and so, too, will our unrealized capitalgains.\nOur flexibility in capital allocation – our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlled\nbusinesses – gives us a significant edge over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they willoperate. Woody Allen once explained that the advantage of being bi-sexual is that it doubles your chanceof finding a date on Saturday night. In like manner – well, not exactly like manner – our appetite for eitheroperating businesses or passive investments doubles ourchances of finding sensible uses for Berkshire’s\nendless gusher of cash. Beyond that, having a huge portfolio of marketable securities gives us a stockpileof funds that can be tapped when an elephant-sized acquisition is offered to us.\n************\nIt’s an election year, and candidates can’t stop speaking about our country’s problems (which, of course,\nonly theycan solve). As a result of this negative drumbeat, many Americans now believe that their children will not\nlive as well as they themselves do.\nThat view is dead wrong: The babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history.American GDP per capita is now about $56,000. As I mentioned last year that – in real terms – is a\nstaggering six times the amount in 1930, the year I was born, a leap far beyond the wildest dreams of my parents ortheir contemporaries. U.S. citizens are not intrinsically more intelligent today, nor do they work harder than didAmericans in 1930. Rather, they work far more efficiently and thereby produce far more. This all-powerful trend iscertain to continue: America’s economic magic remains alive and well.\nSome commentators bemoan our current 2% per year growth in real GDP – and, yes, we would all like to\nsee a higher rate. But let’s do some simple math using the much-lamented 2% figure. That rate, we will see, deliversastounding gains.\n7\n\nAmerica’s population is growing about .8% per year (.5% from births minus deaths and .3% from net\nmigration). Thus 2% of overall growth produces about 1.2% of per capita growth. That may not sound impressive.\nBut in a single generation of, say, 25 years, that rate of growth leads to a gain of 34.4% in realGDP per capita.\n(Compounding’s effects produce the excess over the percentage that would result by simply multiplying 25 x 1.2%.)In turn, that 34.4% gain will produce a staggering $19,000 increase in real GDP per capita for the next generation.\nWere that to be distributed equally, the gain would be $76,000 annually for a family of four. Today’s politiciansneed not shed tears for tomorrow’s children.\nIndeed, most of today’s children are doing well. Allfamilies in my upper middle-class neighborhood\nregularly enjoy a living standard better than that achieved by John D. Rockefeller Sr. at the time of my birth. Hisunparalleled fortune couldn’t buy what we now take for granted, whether the field is – to name just a few –transportation, entertainment, communication or medical services. Rockefeller certainly had power and fame; hecould not, however, live as well as my neighbors now do.\nThough the pie to be shared by the next generation will be farlarger than today’s, how it will be divided\nwill remain fiercely contentious. Just as is now the case, there will be struggles for the increased output of goodsand services between those people in their productive years and retirees, between the healthy and the infirm,between the inheritors and the Horatio Algers, between investors and workers and, in particular, between those withtalents that are valued highly by the marketplace and the equally decent hard-working Americans who lack the skillsthe market prizes. Clashes of that sort have forever been with us – and will forever continue. Congress will be thebattlefield; money and votes will be the weapons. Lobbying will remain a growth industry.\nThe good news, however, is that even members of the “losing” sides will almost certainly enjoy – as they\nshould – far more goods and services in the future than they have in the past. The quality of their increased bounty\nwill also dramatically improve. Nothing rivals the market system in producing what people want – nor, even moreso, in delivering what people don’t yet know they want. My parents, when young, could not envision a televisionset, nor did I, in my 50s, think I needed a personal computer. Both products, once people saw what they could do,quickly revolutionized their lives. I now spend ten hours a week playing bridge online. And, as I write this letter,“search” is invaluable to me. (I’m not ready for Tinder, however.)\nFor 240 years it’s been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start. America’s\ngolden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs. America’s social securitypromises will be honored and perhaps made more generous. And, yes, America’s kids will live far better than theirparents did.\n************\nConsidering this favorable tailwind, Berkshire (and, to be sure, a great many other businesses) will almost\ncertainly prosper. The managers who succeed Charlie and me will build Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic value byfollowing our simple blueprint of: (1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries;(2) further increasing their earnings through bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees;(4) repurchasing Berkshire shares when they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and(5) making an occasional large acquisition. Management will also try to maximize results for youby rarely, if ever,\nissuing Berkshire shares.\n8\n\nIntrinsic Business Value\nAs much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that number\nis for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). It is possible, however, to make a sensible estimate. In our2010 annual report we laid out the three elements – one of them qualitative – that we believe are the keys to anestimation of Berkshire’s intrinsic value. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 113-114.\nHere is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2015 our per-share cash and investments increased\n8.3% to $159,794 (with our Kraft Heinz shares stated at market value), and earnings from our many businesses –including insurance underwriting income – increased 2.1% to $12,304 per share. We exclude in the second factor\nthe dividends and interest from the investments we hold because including them would produce a double-countingof value. In arriving at our earnings figure, we deduct all corporate overhead, interest, depreciation, amortizationand minority interests. Income taxes, though, are not deducted. That is, the earnings are pre-tax .\nI used the italics in the paragraph above because we are for the first time including insurance underwriting\nincome in business earnings. We did not do that when we initially introduced Berkshire’s two quantitative pillars ofvaluation because our insurance results were then heavily influenced by catastrophe coverages. If the wind didn’tblow and the earth didn’t shake, we made large profits. But a mega-catastrophe would produce red ink. In order tobe conservative then in stating our business earnings, we consistently assumed that underwriting would break evenover time and ignored any of its gains or losses in our annual calculation of the second factor of value.\nToday, our insurance results are likely to be more stable than was the case a decade or two ago because we\nhave deemphasized catastrophe coverages and greatly expanded our bread-and-butter lines of business. Last year,our underwriting income contributed $1,118 per share to the $12,304 per share of earnings referenced in the secondparagraph of this section. Over the past decade, annual underwriting income has averaged $1,434 per share, and weanticipate being profitable in most years. You should recognize, however, that underwriting in any given year couldwell be unprofitable, perhaps substantially so.\nSince 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 18.9% compounded annually, and our\nearnings ( including the underwriting results in both the initial and terminal year) have grown at a 23.7% clip. It is no\ncoincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the ensuing 45 years has increased at a rate very similar to that ofour two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains in both sectors, but our main goal is to build operatingearnings.\n************\nNow, let’s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and\nincome characteristics from the others. So we’ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie andI view them (though there are important and enduring economic advantages to having them all under one roof). Our\nintent is to provide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you beingthe reporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (Don’t get excited; this is not a switch we are considering.)\nInsurance\nLet’s look first at insurance. The property-casualty (“P/C”) branch of that industry has been the engine that\nhas propelled our expansion since 1967, when we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, NationalFire & Marine, for $8.6 million. Today, National Indemnity is the largest property-casualty company in the world,as measured by net worth. Moreover, its intrinsic value is farin excess of the value at which it is carried on our\nbooks.\n9\n\nOne reason we were attracted to the P/C business was its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receive\npremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certain workers’ compensationaccidents, payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companiesholding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest thisfloat for their own benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holdsusually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float.And howwe have grown, as the following table shows:\nYear\nFloat (in millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322015 87,722\nFurther gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO and several of our specialized\noperations are almost certain to grow at a good clip. National Indemnity’s reinsurance division, however, is party toa number of run-off contracts whose float drifts downward. If we do in time experience a decline in float, it will bevery gradual – at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can\nnever be subject to immediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. This\nstructure is by design and is a key component in the strength of Berkshire’s economic fortress. It will never be\ncompromised.\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money– and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous\nindeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss,\nin effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insuranceindustry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning subnormalreturns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses. The prolonged period of low interest ratesthe world is now dealing with also virtually guarantees that earnings on float will steadily decrease for many yearsto come, thereby exacerbating the profit problems of insurers. It’s a good bet that industry results over the next tenyears will fall short of those recorded in the past decade, particularly for those companies that specialize inreinsurance.\nAs noted early in this report, Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for 13 consecutive\nyears, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $26.2 billion. That’s no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation isthe daily focus of allof our insurance managers, who know that while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned\nby poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service. At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testamentstyle.\nSo how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire’s book value is calculated, the fullamount of\nour float is deducted as a liability , just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think of\nfloat as strictly a liability is incorrect. It should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims andrelated expenses – a huge $24.5 billion to more than six million claimants in 2015 – and that reduces float. Just assurely, we each day write new business that will soon generate its own claims, adding to float.\n10\n\nIf our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this\nliability is dramatically less than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises –\nbecause new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute – is worlds different from owing $1 that will go out thedoor tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities, however, are treated as equals under GAAP.\nA partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion “goodwill” asset that we incurred in buying our\ninsurance companies and that increases book value. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paid forthe float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing on\nits true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, anygoodwill\nasset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\nFortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\ninsurance goodwill – what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance\noperation possessing it – to be farin excess of its historic carrying value. Indeed, almost the entire $15.5 billion we\ncarry for goodwill in our insurance business was already on our books in 2000. Yet we subsequently tripled our\nfloat. Its value today is one reason – a huge reason – why we believe Berkshire’s intrinsic business valuesubstantially exceeds its book value.\n************\nBerkshire’s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running\ndisciplined operations that possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks\nthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks thatare inappropriate in relation to our resources.\nIndeed, Berkshire is farmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if the\ninsurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe – a loss about triple anythingit has ever experienced – Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of itsmany streams of earnings. We would also remain awash in cash and be looking for large opportunities to writebusiness in an insurance market that might well be in disarray. Meanwhile, other major insurers and reinsurerswould be swimming in red ink, if not facing insolvency.\nWhen Ajit entered Berkshire’s office on a Saturday in 1986, he did not have a day’s experience in the\ninsurance business. Nevertheless, Mike Goldberg, then our manager of insurance, handed him the keys to ourreinsurance business. With that move, Mike achieved sainthood: Since then, Ajit has created tens of billions ofvalue for Berkshire shareholders.\n************\nWe have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actuallycausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after bothprospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriatepremium can’t be obtained.\n11\n\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can’t turn their back on business\nthat is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, “The other guy is doing it, so we must as well,”spells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.\nTad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re’s huge\nfloat has been considerably better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue.We are particularly enthusiastic about General Re’s international life reinsurance business, which has grownconsistently and profitably since we acquired the company in 1998.\nIt can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, it was beset by problems that caused\ncommentators – and me as well, briefly – to believe I had made a huge mistake. That day is long gone. General Reis now a gem.\n************\nFinally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 65 years ago. GEICO is managed by Tony\nNicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 54 years of service in 2015. Tony became CEO in 1993, andsince then the company has been flying. There is nobetter manager than Tony. In the 40 years that I’ve known him,\nhis every action has made great sense.\nWhen I was first introduced to GEICO in January 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage the\ncompany enjoyed compared to the expenses borne by the giants of the industry. It was clear to me that GEICOwould succeed because it deserved to succeed.\nNo one likes to buy auto insurance. Almost everyone, though, likes to drive. The insurance consequently\nneeded is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them – and only a low-cost operation can deliver\nthese. Indeed, at least 40% of the people reading this letter can save money by insuring with GEICO. So stopreading – right now! – and go to geico.com or call 800-368-2734.\nGEICO’s cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year after\nyear. (We ended 2015 with 11.4% of the market compared to 2.5% in 1995, when Berkshire acquired control ofGEICO.) The company’s low costs create a moat – an enduring one – that competitors are unable to cross.\nAll the while, our gecko never tires of telling Americans how GEICO can save them important money. I\nlove hearing the little guy deliver his message: “15 minutes could save you 15% or more on car insurance.” (Ofcourse, there’s always a grouch in the crowd. One of my friends says he is glad that only a few animals can talk,since the ones that do speak seem unable to discuss any subject but insurance.)\n************\nIn addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies that primarily\nwrite commercial coverages. In aggregate, these companies are a large, growing and valuable operation thatconsistently delivers an underwriting profit, usually much better than that reported by their competitors. Indeed,over the past 13 years, this group has earned $4 billion from underwriting – about 13% of its premium volume –while increasing its float from $943 million to $9.9 billion.\nLess than three years ago, we formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BHSI”), which we include\nin this group. Our first decision was to put Peter Eastwood in charge. That move was a home run: BHSI has alreadydeveloped $1 billion of annual premium volume and, under Peter’s direction, is destined to become one of theworld’s leading P/C insurers.\n12\n\nHere’s a recap of underwriting earnings and float by division:\nUnderwriting Profit Yearend Float\n(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2015 2014 2015 2014\nBH Reinsurance ............................... $ 4 2 1 $ 6 0 6 $ 44,108 $ 42,454\nGeneral Re ................................... 1 3 2 2 7 7 18,560 19,280\nGEICO ...................................... 4 6 0 1,159 15,148 13,569\nOther Primary ................................. 8 2 4 6 2 6 9,906 8,618\n$ 1,837 $ 2,668 $ 87,722 $ 83,921\nBerkshire’s great managers, premier financial strength and a variety of business models protected by wide\nmoats amount to something unique in the insurance world. This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset forBerkshire shareholders that will only get more valuable with time.\nRegulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\nWe have two major operations, BNSF and BHE, that share important characteristics distinguishing them\nfrom our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section in this letter and split out their combinedfinancial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement. Together, they last year accounted for 37% ofBerkshire’s after-tax operating earnings.\nA key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, with\nthese partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact\nnot needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions would far exceedits interest requirements. Last year, for example, in a disappointing year for railroads, BNSF’s interest coverage wasmore than 8:1. (Our definition of coverage is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest, notEBITDA/\ninterest, a commonly used measure we view as seriously flawed.)\nAt BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company’s ability to service its debt under all circumstances.\nThe first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companies offering anessential service on an exclusive basis. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great and ever-wideningdiversity of earnings streams, which shield BHE from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body. Thesemany sources of profit, supplemented by the inherent advantage of being owned by a strong parent, have allowedBHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost of debt. This economic fact benefits both us andour\ncustomers.\nAll told, BHE and BNSF invested $11.6 billion in plant and equipment last year, a massive commitment to\nkey components of America’s infrastructure. We relish making such investments as long as they promise reasonablereturns – and, on that front, we put a large amount of trust in future regulation.\nOur confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever need\nhuge investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capital providersin a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in our self-interestto conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.\nLow prices are a powerful way to keep these constituencies happy. In Iowa, BHE’s average retail rate is\n6.8¢ per KWH. Alliant, the other major electric utility in the state, averages 9.5¢. Here are the comparable industryfigures for adjacent states: Nebraska 9.0¢, Missouri 9.3¢, Illinois 9.3¢, Minnesota 9.7¢. The national average is10.4¢. Our rock-bottom prices add up to real money for paycheck-strapped customers.\n13\n\nAt BNSF, price comparisons between major railroads are far more difficult to make because of significant\ndifferences in both their mix of cargo and the average distance it is carried. To supply a very crude measure,\nhowever, our revenue per ton-mile was just under 3¢ last year, while shipping costs for customers of the other fourmajor U.S.-based railroads were at least 40% higher, ranging from 4.2¢ to 5.3¢.\nBoth BHE and BNSF have been leaders in pursuing planet-friendly technology. In wind generation, no\nstate comes close to Iowa, where last year megawatt-hours we generated from wind equaled 47% of allmegawatt-hours sold to our retail customers. (Additional wind projects to which we are committed will take thatfigure to 58% in 2017.)\nBNSF, like other Class I railroads, uses only a single gallon of diesel fuel to move a ton of freight almost\n500 miles. That makes the railroads four times as fuel-efficient as trucks! Furthermore, railroads alleviate highwaycongestion – and the taxpayer-funded maintenance expenditures that come with heavier traffic – in a major way.\nHere are the key figures for BHE and BNSF:\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy (89.9% owned)\nEarnings (in millions)\n2015 2014 2013\nU.K. utilities ..................................................... $ 4 6 0 $ 5 2 7 $ 3 6 2\nIowa utility ...................................................... 3 1 4 2 9 8 2 3 0\nNevada utilities .................................................. 5 8 6 5 4 9 (58)\nPacifiCorp (primarily Oregon and Utah) ............................... 1,026 1,010 982\nGas pipelines (Northern Natural and Kern River) ........................ 4 0 1 3 7 9 3 8 5\nCanadian transmission utility ........................................ 1 7 0 1 6 —\nRenewable projects ............................................... 1 7 5 1 9 4 5 0\nHomeServices ................................................... 1 9 1 1 3 9 1 3 9\nOther (net) ...................................................... 2 7 2 6 1 2\nOperating earnings before corporate interest and taxes .................... 3,350 3,138 2,102\nInterest ......................................................... 4 9 9 4 2 7 2 9 6\nIncome taxes .................................................... 4 8 1 6 1 6 1 7 0\nNet earnings ..................................................... $ 2,370 $ 2,095 $ 1,636\nEarnings applicable to Berkshire ..................................... $ 2,132 $ 1,882 $ 1,470\nBNSF Earnings (in millions)\n2015 2014 2013\nRevenues ....................................................... $ 21,967 $ 23,239 $ 22,014\nOperating expenses ............................................... 14,264 16,237 15,357\nOperating earnings before interest and taxes ............................ 7,703 7,002 6,657\nInterest (net) ..................................................... 9 2 8 8 3 3 7 2 9\nIncome taxes .................................................... 2,527 2,300 2,135\nNet earnings ..................................................... $ 4,248 $ 3,869 $ 3,793\nI currently expect increased after-tax earnings at BHE in 2016, but lower earnings at BNSF.\n14\n\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations\nOur activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront.

In contrast, the operating expense\nfigures above are non-GAAP because they exclude some purchase-accounting items (primarily the amortization ofcertain intangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbersmore accurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businesses aggregated in the table than doGAAP figures.\nI won’t explain all of the adjustments – some are tiny and arcane – but serious investors should understand\nthe disparate nature of intangible assets. Some truly deplete in value over time, while others in no way lose value.\nFor software, as a big example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Conversely, the concept of recordingcharges against other intangibles, such as customer relationships, arises from purchase-accounting rules and clearlydoes not reflect economic reality. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both,that is, are recorded as expenses when earnings are calculated – even though, from an investor’s viewpoint, theycould not differ more.\n15\n\nIn the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 38, amortization charges of $1.1 billion have been\ndeducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these “real,” the rest not. The “non-real” charges, once non-existent at Berkshire, have become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. Non-realamortization charges are likely to climb further as we acquire more companies.\nThe table on page 55 gives you the current status of our intangible assets as calculated by GAAP. We now\nhave $6.8 billion left of amortizable intangibles, of which $4.1 billion will be expensed over the next five years.Eventually, of course, every dollar of these “assets” will be charged off. When that happens, reported earningsincrease even if true earnings are flat. (My gift to my successor.)\nI suggest that you ignore a portion of GAAP amortization costs. But it is with some trepidation that I do\nthat, knowing that it has become common for managers to tell their owners to ignore certain expense items that areall too real. “Stock-based compensation” is the most egregious example. The very name says it all: “compensation.”If compensation isn’t an expense, what is it? And, if real and recurring expenses don’t belong in the calculation ofearnings, where in the world do they belong?\nWall Street analysts often play their part in this charade, too, parroting the phony, compensation-ignoring\n“earnings” figures fed them by managements. Maybe the offending analysts don’t know any better. Or maybe theyfear losing “access” to management. Or maybe they are cynical, telling themselves that since everyone else isplaying the game, why shouldn’t they go along with it. Whatever their reasoning, these analysts are guilty ofpropagating misleading numbers that can deceive investors.\nDepreciation charges are a more complicated subject but are almost always true costs. Certainly they are at\nBerkshire. I wish we could keep our businesses competitive while spending less than our depreciation charge, but in51 years I’ve yet to figure out how to do so. Indeed, the depreciation charge we record in our railroad business fallsfar short of the capital outlays needed to merely keep the railroad running properly, a mismatch that leads to GAAPearnings that are higher than true economic earnings. (This overstatement of earnings exists at all railroads.) WhenCEOs or investment bankers tout pre-depreciation figures such as EBITDA as a valuation guide, watch their noseslengthen while they speak.\nOur public reports of earnings will, of course, continue to conform to GAAP. To embrace reality, however,\nyou should remember to add back most of the amortization charges we report. You should also subtract somethingto reflect BNSF’s inadequate depreciation charge.\n************\nLet’s get back to our many manufacturing, service and retailing operations, which sell products ranging\nfrom lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of this sector’s businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible\nassets, enjoy terrific economics, producing profits that run from 25% after-tax to far more than 100%. Othersgenerate good returns in the area of 12% to 20%.\nA few, however – these are serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation – have very poor\nreturns. In most of these cases, I was wrong in my evaluation of the economic dynamics of the company or theindustry in which it operates, and we are now paying the price for my misjudgments. At other times, I stumbled inevaluating either the fidelity or the ability of incumbent managers or ones I later appointed. I will commit moreerrors; you can count on that. If we luck out, they will occur at our smaller operations.\nViewed as a single entity, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employed an average\nof $25.6 billion of net tangible assets during 2015 and, despite their holding large quantities of excess cash andusing only token amounts of leverage, earned 18.4% after-tax on that capital.\n16\n\nOf course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if it is bought at too high a price. We\nhave paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the largefigure we show for goodwill and other intangibles. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capitalwe have deployed in this sector. Earnings from the group should grow substantially in 2016 as Duracell andPrecision Castparts enter the fold.\n************\nWe have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, their\ncompetitors – both current and potential – read this report. In a few of our businesses we might be disadvantaged ifothers knew our numbers. In some of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of Berkshire,therefore, we only disclose what is required. You can nevertheless find a good bit of detail about many of ouroperations on pages 88-91.\nFinance and Financial Products\nOur three leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture), XTRA (semi-trailers), and\nMarmon (primarily tank cars but also freight cars, intermodal tank containers and cranes). These companies areindustry leaders and have substantially increased their earnings as the American economy has gained strength. Ateach of the three, we have invested more money in new equipment than have many of our competitors, and that’spaid off. Dealing from strength is one of Berkshire’s enduring advantages.\nKevin Clayton has again delivered an industry-leading performance at Clayton Homes, the second-largest\nhome builder in America. Last year, the company sold 34,397 homes, about 45% of the manufactured homes boughtby Americans. In contrast, the company was number three in the field, with a 14% share, when Berkshire purchasedit in 2003.\nManufactured homes allow the American dream of home ownership to be achieved by lower-income\ncitizens: Around 70% of new homes costing $150,000 or less come from our industry. About 46% of Clayton’shomes are sold through the 331 stores we ourselves own and operate. Most of Clayton’s remaining sales are made to1,395 independent retailers.\nKey to Clayton’s operation is its $12.8 billion mortgage portfolio. We originate about 35% of all\nmortgages on manufactured homes. About 37% of our mortgage portfolio emanates from our retail operation, withthe balance primarily originated by independent retailers, some of which sell our homes while others market onlythe homes of our competitors.\nLenders other than Clayton have come and gone. With Berkshire’s backing, however, Clayton steadfastly\nfinanced home buyers throughout the panic days of 2008-2009. Indeed, during that period, Clayton used preciouscapital to finance dealers who did notsell our homes. The funds we supplied to Goldman Sachs and General Electric\nat that time produced headlines; the funds Berkshire quietly delivered to Clayton both made home ownershippossible for thousands of families and kept many non-Clayton dealers alive.\nOur retail outlets, employing simple language and large type, consistently inform home buyers of\nalternative sources for financing – most of it coming from local banks – and always secure acknowledgments fromcustomers that this information has been received and read. (The form we use is reproduced in its actual size onpage 119.)\n17\n\nMortgage-origination practices are of great importance to both the borrower and to society. There is no\nquestion that reckless practices in home lending played a major role in bringing on the financial panic of 2008,which in turn led to the Great Recession. In the years preceding the meltdown, a destructive and often corruptpattern of mortgage creation flourished whereby (1) an originator in, say, California would make loans and(2) promptly sell them to an investment or commercial bank in, say, New York, which would package manymortgages to serve as collateral for a dizzyingly complicated array of mortgage-backed securities to be (3) sold tounwitting institutions around the world.\nAs if these sins weren’t sufficient to create an unholy mess, imaginative investment bankers sometimes\nconcocted a second layer of sliced-up financing whose value depended on the junkier portions of primary offerings.(When Wall Street gets “innovative,” watch out!) While that was going on, I described this “doubling-up” practiceas requiring an investor to read tens of thousands of pages of mind-numbing prose to evaluate a single securitybeing offered.\nBoth the originator and the packager of these financings had no skin in the game and were driven by\nvolume and mark-ups. Many housing borrowers joined the party as well, blatantly lying on their loan applicationswhile mortgage originators looked the other way. Naturally, the gamiest credits generated the most profits. SmoothWall Street salesmen garnered millions annually by manufacturing products that their customers were unable tounderstand. (It’s also questionable as to whether the major rating agencies were capable of evaluating the morecomplex structures. But rate them they did.)\nBarney Frank, perhaps the most financially-savvy member of Congress during the panic, recently assessed\nthe 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, saying, “The one major weakness that I’ve seen in the implementation was this decisionby the regulators not to impose risk retention on all residential mortgages.” Today, some legislators andcommentators continue to advocate a 1%-to-5% retention by the originator as a way to align its interests with that ofthe ultimate lender or mortgage guarantor.\nAt Clayton, our risk retention was, and is, 100%. When we originate a mortgage we keep it (leaving aside\nthe few that qualify for a government guarantee). When we make mistakes in granting credit, we therefore pay aprice – a hefty price that dwarfs any profit we realized upon the original sale of the home. Last year we had toforeclose on 8,444 manufactured-housing mortgages at a cost to us of $157 million.\nThe average loan we made in 2015 was only $59,942, small potatoes for traditional mortgage lenders, but a\ndaunting commitment for our many lower-income borrowers. Our buyer acquires a decent home – take a look at thehome we will have on display at our annual meeting – requiring monthly principal-and-interest payments thataverage $522.\nSome borrowers, of course, will lose their jobs, and there will be divorces and deaths. Others will get over-\nextended on credit cards and mishandle their finances. We will lose money then, and our borrower will lose hisdown payment (though his mortgage payments during his time of occupancy may have been well under rental ratesfor comparable quarters). Nevertheless, despite the low FICO scores and income of our borrowers, their paymentbehavior during the Great Recession was farbetter than that prevailing in many mortgage pools populated by people\nearning multiples of our typical borrower’s income.\nThe strong desire of our borrowers to have a home of their own is one reason we’ve done well with our\nmortgage portfolio. Equally important, we have financed much of the portfolio with floating-rate debt or with short-term fixed-rate debt. Consequently, the incredibly low short-term rates of recent years have provided us aconstantly-widening spread between our interest costs and the income we derive from our mortgage portfolio, whichbears fixed rates. (Incidentally, we would have enjoyed similar margins had we simply bought long-term bonds andfinanced the position in some short-term manner.)\n18\n\nNormally, it is risky business to lend long at fixed rates and borrow short as we have been doing at\nClayton. Over the years, some important financial institutions have gone broke doing that. At Berkshire, however,we possess a natural offset in that our businesses always maintain at least $20 billion in cash-equivalents that earn\nshort-term rates. More often, our short-term investments are in the $40 billion to $60 billion range. If we have, say,$60 billion invested at\n1⁄4% or less, a sharp move to higher short-term rates would bring benefits to us far exceeding\nthe higher financing costs we would incur in funding Clayton’s $13 billion mortgage portfolio. In banking terms,Berkshire is – and always will be – heavily asset-sensitive and will consequently benefit from rising interest rates.\nLet me talk about one subject of which I am particularly proud, that having to do with regulation. The\nGreat Recession caused mortgage originators, servicers and packagers to come under intense scrutiny and to beassessed many billions of dollars in fines and penalties.\nThe scrutiny has certainly extended to Clayton, whose mortgage practices have been continuously\nreviewed and examined in respect to such items as originations, servicing, collections, advertising, compliance, andinternal controls. At the federal level, we answer to the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Housing andUrban Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Dozens of states regulate us as well. During thepast two years, indeed, various federal and state authorities (from 25 states) examined and reviewed Clayton and itsmortgages on 65 occasions. The result? Our total fines during this period were $38,200 and our refunds to customers$704,678. Furthermore, though we had to foreclose on 2.64% of our manufactured-home mortgages last year,95.4% of our borrowers were current on their payments at yearend, as they moved toward owning a debt-free home.\n************\nMarmon’s rail fleet expanded to 133,220 units by yearend, a number significantly increased by the\ncompany’s purchase of 25,085 cars from General Electric on September 30. If our fleet was connected to form asingle train, the engine would be in Omaha and the caboose in Portland, Maine.\nAt yearend, 97% of our railcars were leased, with about 15-17% of the fleet coming up for renewal each\nyear. Though “tank cars” sound like vessels carrying crude oil, only about 7% of our fleet carries that product;chemicals and refined petroleum products are the lead items we transport. When trains roll by, look for the UTLX orProcor markings that identify our tank cars. When you spot the brand, puff out your chest; you own a portion of thatcar.\nHere’s the earnings recap for this sector:\n2015\n2014 2013\n(in millions)\nBerkadia (our 50% share) ............................. $ 7 4 $ 1 2 2 $ 8 0\nClayton ............................................ 7 0 6 5 5 8 4 1 6\nCORT ............................................. 5 5 4 9 4 2\nMarmon – Containers and Cranes ....................... 1 9 2 2 3 8 2 2 6\nMarmon – Railcars ................................... 5 4 6 4 4 2 3 5 3\nXTRA ............................................. 1 7 2 1 4 7 1 2 5\nNet financial income* ................................ 3 4 1 2 8 3 3 2 2\n$ 2,086 $ 1,839 $ 1,564\n* Excludes capital gains or losses\n19\n\nInvestments\nBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value.

That kind of improvement has been the secret sauce of America’s remarkable gains in livingstandards since the nation’s founding in 1776. Unfortunately, the label of “secret” is appropriate: Too fewAmericans fully grasp the linkage between productivity and prosperity. To see that connection, let’s look first at thecountry’s most dramatic example – farming – and later examine three Berkshire-specific areas.\nIn 1900, America’s civilian work force numbered 28 million. Of these, 11 million, a staggering 40% of the\ntotal, worked in farming. The leading crop then, as now, was corn. About 90 million acres were devoted to itsproduction and the yield per acre was 30 bushels, for a total output of 2.7 billion bushels annually.\nThen came the tractor and one innovation after another that revolutionized such keys to farm productivity\nas planting, harvesting, irrigation, fertilization and seed quality. Today, we devote about 85 million acres to corn.Productivity, however, has improved yields to more than 150 bushels per acre, for an annual output of 13-14 billionbushels. Farmers have made similar gains with other products.\nIncreased yields, though, are only half the story: The huge increases in physical output have been\naccompanied by a dramatic reduction in the number of farm laborers (“human input”). Today about three millionpeople work on farms, a tiny 2% of our 158-million-person work force. Thus, improved farming methods haveallowed tens of millions of present-day workers to utilize their time and talents in other endeavors, a reallocation ofhuman resources that enables Americans of today to enjoy huge quantities of non-farm goods and services they\nwould otherwise lack.\nIt’s easy to look back over the 115-year span and realize how extraordinarily beneficial agricultural\ninnovations have been – not just for farmers but, more broadly, for our entire society. We would not have anythingclose to the America we now know had we stifled those improvements in productivity. (It was fortunate that horsescouldn’t vote.) On a day-to-day basis, however, talk of the “greater good” must have rung hollow to farm hands wholost their jobs to machines that performed routine tasks far more efficiently than humans ever could. We willexamine this flip-side to productivity gains later in this section.\nFor the moment, however, let’s move on to three stories of efficiencies that have had major consequences\nfor Berkshire subsidiaries. Similar transformations have been commonplace throughout American business.\n‹In 1947, shortly after the end of World War II, the American workforce totaled 44 million. About1.35 million workers were employed in the railroad industry. The revenue ton-miles of freight moved byClass I railroads that year totaled 655 billion.\nBy 2014, Class I railroads carried 1.85 trillion ton-miles, an increase of 182%, while employing only\n187,000 workers, a reduction of 86% since 1947. (Some of this change involved passenger-relatedemployees, but most of the workforce reduction came on the freight side.) As a result of this staggeringimprovement in productivity, the inflation-adjusted price for moving a ton-mile of freight has fallen by55% since 1947, a drop saving shippers about $90 billion annually in current dollars.\nAnother startling statistic: If it took as many people now to move freight as it did in 1947, we would need\nwell over three million railroad workers to handle present volumes. (Of course, that level of employmentwould raise freight charges by a lot; consequently, nothing close to today’s volume would actually move.)\n21\n\nOur own BNSF was formed in 1995 by a merger between Burlington Northern and Santa Fe. In 1996, the\nmerged company’s first full year of operation, 411 million ton-miles of freight were transported by 45,000employees. Last year the comparable figures were 702 million ton-miles (plus 71%) and 47,000 employees(plus only 4%). That dramatic gain in productivity benefits both owners and shippers. Safety at BNSF hasimproved as well: Reportable injuries were 2.04 per 200,000 man-hours in 1996 and have since fallen morethan 50% to 0.95.\n‹A bit more than a century ago, the auto was invented, and around it formed an industry that insures carsand their drivers. Initially, this business was written through traditional insurance agencies – the kinddealing in fire insurance. This agency-centric approach included high commissions and other underwritingexpenses that consumed about 40¢ of the premium dollar. Strong local agencies were then in the driver’sseat because they represented multiple insurers and could play one company off against another whencommissions were being negotiated. Cartel-like pricing prevailed, and all involved were doing fine –except for the consumer.\nAnd then some American ingenuity came into play: G. J. Mecherle, a farmer from Merna, Illinois, came up\nwith the idea of a captive sales force that would sell the insurance products of only a single company. Hisbaby was christened State Farm Mutual. The company cut commissions and expenses – moves thatpermitted lower prices – and soon became a powerhouse. For many decades, State Farm has been therunaway volume leader in both auto and homeowner’s insurance. Allstate, which also operated with adirect distribution model, was long the runner-up. Both State Farm and Allstate have had underwritingexpenses of about 25%.\nIn the early 1930s, another contender, United Services Auto Association (“USAA”), a mutual-like\ncompany, was writing auto insurance for military officers on a direct-to-the-customer basis. This marketinginnovation rose from a need that military personnel had to buy insurance that would stay with them as theymoved from base to base. That was business of little interest to local insurance agencies, which wanted thesteady renewals that came from permanent residents.\nThe direct distribution method of USAA, as it happened, incurred lower costs than those enjoyed by State\nFarm and Allstate and therefore delivered an even greater bargain to customers. That made Leo and LillianGoodwin, employees of USAA, dream of broadening the target market for its direct distribution modelbeyond military officers. In 1936, starting with $100,000 of capital, they incorporated GovernmentEmployees Insurance Co. (later compressing this mouthful to GEICO).\nTheir fledgling did $238,000 of auto insurance business in 1937, its first full year. Last year GEICO did\n$22.6 billion , more than double the volume of USAA. (Though the early bird gets the worm, the second\nmouse gets the cheese.) GEICO’s underwriting expenses in 2015 were 14.7% of premiums, with USAAbeing the only large company to achieve a lower percentage. (GEICO is fully as efficient as USAA butspends considerably more on advertising aimed at promoting growth.)\nWith the price advantage GEICO’s low costs allow, it’s not surprising that several years ago the company\nseized the number two spot in auto insurance from Allstate. GEICO is also gaining ground on State Farm,though it is still far ahead of us in volume. On August 30, 2030 – my 100\nthbirthday – I plan to announce\nthat GEICO has taken over the top spot. Mark your calendar.\nGEICO employs about 34,000 people to serve its 14 million policyholders. I can only guess at the\nworkforce it would require to serve a similar number of policyholders under the agency system. I believe,however, that the number would be at least 60,000, a combination of what the insurer would need in directemployment and the personnel required at supporting agencies.\n22\n\n‹In its electric utility business, our Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) operates within a changing\neconomic model. Historically, the survival of a local electric company did not depend on its efficiency. Infact, a “sloppy” operation could do just fine financially.\nThat’s because utilities were usually the sole supplier of a needed product and were allowed to price at a\nlevel that gave them a prescribed return upon the capital they employed. The joke in the industry was that autility was the only business that would automatically earn more money by redecorating the boss’s office.And some CEOs ran things accordingly.\nThat’s all changing. Today, society has decided that federally-subsidized wind and solar generation is in\nour country’s long-term interest. Federal tax credits are used to implement this policy, support that makesrenewables price-competitive in certain geographies. Those tax credits, or other government-mandated helpfor renewables, may eventually erode the economics of the incumbent utility, particularly if it is a high-costoperator. BHE’s long-established emphasis on efficiency – even when the company didn’t need it to attainauthorized earnings – leaves us particularly competitive in today’s market (and, more important, intomorrow’s as well).\nBHE acquired its Iowa utility in 1999. In the year before, that utility employed 3,700 people and produced\n19 million megawatt-hours of electricity. Now we employ 3,500 people and produce 29 million megawatt-hours. That major increase in efficiency allowed us to operate without a rate increase for 16 years, a periodduring which industry rates increased 44%.\nThe safety record of our Iowa utility is also outstanding. It had .79 injuries per 100 employees in 2015\ncompared to the rate of 7.0 experienced by the previous owner in the year before we bought the operation.\nIn 2006 BHE purchased PacifiCorp, which operated primarily in Oregon and Utah. The year before our\npurchase PacifiCorp employed 6,750 people and produced 52.6 million megawatt-hours. Last year thenumbers were 5,700 employees and 56.3 million megawatt-hours. Here, too, safety improved dramatically,with the accident-rate-per-100-employees falling from 3.4 in 2005 to .85 in 2015. In safety, BHE nowranks in the industry’s top decile.\nThose outstanding performances explain why BHE is welcomed by regulators when it proposes to buy a\nutility in their jurisdiction. The regulators know the company will run an efficient, safe and reliableoperation and also arrive with unlimited capital to fund whatever projects make sense. (BHE has never paida dividend to Berkshire since we assumed ownership. No investor-owned utility in America comes close tomatching BHE’s enthusiasm for reinvestment.)\n************\nThe productivity gains that I’ve just spelled out – and countless others that have been achieved in America\n– have delivered awesome benefits to society. That’s the reason our citizens, as a whole, have enjoyed – and willcontinue to enjoy – major gains in the goods and services they receive.\nTo this thought there are offsets. First, the productivity gains achieved in recent years have largely\nbenefitted the wealthy. Second, productivity gains frequently cause upheaval: Both capital and labor can pay aterrible price when innovation or new efficiencies upend their worlds.\nWe need shed no tears for the capitalists (whether they be private owners or an army of public\nshareholders). It’s their job to take care of themselves. When large rewards can flow to investors from gooddecisions, these parties should not be spared the losses produced by wrong choices. Moreover, investors who\ndiversify widely and simply sit tight with their holdings are certain to prosper: In America, gains from winninginvestments have always farmore than offset the losses from clunkers. (During the 20\nthCentury, the Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average – an index fund of sorts – soared from 66 to 11,497, with its component companies all the whilepaying ever-increasing dividends.)\n23\n\nA long-employed worker faces a different equation. When innovation and the market system interact to\nproduce efficiencies, many workers may be rendered unnecessary, their talents obsolete. Some can find decentemployment elsewhere; for others, that is not an option.\nWhen low-cost competition drove shoe production to Asia, our once-prosperous Dexter operation folded,\nputting 1,600 employees in a small Maine town out of work. Many were past the point in life at which they couldlearn another trade. We lost our entire investment, which we could afford, but many workers lost a livelihood theycould not replace. The same scenario unfolded in slow-motion at our original New England textile operation, whichstruggled for 20 years before expiring. Many older workers at our New Bedford plant, as a poignant example, spokePortuguese and knew little, if any, English. They had no Plan B.\nThe answer in such disruptions is not the restraining or outlawing of actions that increase productivity.\nAmericans would not be living nearly as well as we do if we had mandated that 11 million people should forever beemployed in farming.\nThe solution, rather, is a variety of safety nets aimed at providing a decent life for those who are willing to\nwork but find their specific talents judged of small value because of market forces. (I personally favor a reformedand expanded Earned Income Tax Credit that would try to make sure America works for those willing to work.) Theprice of achieving ever-increasing prosperity for the great majority of Americans should not be penury for theunfortunate.\nImportant Risks\nWe, like all public companies, are required by the SEC to annually catalog “risk factors” in our 10-K. I\ncan’t remember, however, an instance when reading a 10-K’s “risk” section has helped me in evaluating a business.That’s not because the identified risks aren’t real. The truly important risks, however, are usually well known.Beyond that, a 10-K’s catalog of risks is seldom of aid in assessing: (1) the probability of the threatening eventactually occurring; (2) the range of costs if it does occur; and (3) the timing of the possible loss. A threat that willonly surface 50 years from now may be a problem for society, but it is not a financial problem for today’s investor.\nBerkshire operates in more industries than any company I know of. Each of our pursuits has its own array\nof possible problems and opportunities. Those are easy to list but hard to evaluate: Charlie, I and our various CEOsoften differ in a very major way in our calculation of the likelihood, the timing and the cost (or benefit) that mayresult from these possibilities.\nLet me mention just a few examples. To begin with an obvious threat, BNSF, along with other railroads, is\ncertain to lose significant coal volume over the next decade. At some point in the future – though not, in my view,\nfor a long time – GEICO’s premium volume mayshrink because of driverless cars. This development could hurt our\nauto dealerships as well. Circulation of our print newspapers will continue to fall, a certainty we allowed for whenpurchasing them. To date, renewables have helped our utility operation but that could change, particularly if storagecapabilities for electricity materially improve. Online retailing threatens the business model of our retailers andcertain of our consumer brands. These potentialities are just a few of the negative possibilities facing us – but eventhe most casual follower of business news has long been aware of them.\nNone of these problems, however, is crucial to Berkshire’s long-term well-being. When we took over the\ncompany in 1965, its risks could have been encapsulated in a single sentence: “The northern textile business inwhich all of our capital resides is destined for recurring losses and will eventually disappear.” That development,however, was no death knell. We simply adapted. And we will continue to do so.\n24\n\nEvery day Berkshire managers are thinking about how they can better compete in an always-changing\nworld. Just as vigorously, Charlie and I focus on where a steady stream of funds should be deployed. In that respect,we possess a major advantage over one-industry companies, whose options are far more limited. I firmly believethat Berkshire has the money, talent and culture to plow through the sort of adversities I’ve itemized above – andmany more – and to emerge with ever-greater earning power.\nThere is, however, one clear, present and enduring danger to Berkshire against which Charlie and I are\npowerless. That threat to Berkshire is also the major threat our citizenry faces: a “successful” (as defined by theaggressor) cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack on the United States. That is a risk Berkshire shares with all\nof American business.\nThe probability of such mass destruction in any given year is likely very small. It’s been more than 70\nyears since I delivered a Washington Post newspaper headlining the fact that the United States had dropped the firstatomic bomb. Subsequently, we’ve had a few close calls but avoided catastrophic destruction. We can thank ourgovernment – and luck! – for this result.\nNevertheless, what’s a small probability in a short period approaches certainty in the longer run. (If there is\nonly one chance in thirty of an event occurring in a given year, the likelihood of it occurring at least once in acentury is 96.6%.) The added bad news is that there will forever be people and organizations and perhaps evennations that would like to inflict maximum damage on our country. Their means of doing so have increasedexponentially during my lifetime. “Innovation” has its dark side.\nThere is no way for American corporations or their investors to shed this risk. If an event occurs in the U.S.\nthat leads to mass devastation, the value of all equity investments will almost certainly be decimated.\nNo one knows what “the day after” will look like. I think, however, that Einstein’s 1949 appraisal remains\napt: “I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks andstones.”\n************\nI am writing this section because we have a proxy proposal regarding climate change to consider at this\nyear’s annual meeting. The sponsor would like us to provide a report on the dangers that this change might presentto our insurance operation and explain how we are responding to these threats.\nIt seems highly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet. I say “highly likely”\nrather than “certain” because I have no scientific aptitude and remember well the dire predictions of most “experts”about Y2K. It would be foolish, however, for me or anyone to demand 100% proof of huge forthcoming damage tothe world if that outcome seemed at all possible and if prompt action had even a small chance of thwarting thedanger.\nThis issue bears a similarity to Pascal’s Wager on the Existence of God. Pascal, it may be recalled, argued\nthat if there were only a tiny probability that God truly existed, it made sense to behave as if He did because therewards could be infinite whereas the lack of belief risked eternal misery. Likewise, if there is only a 1% chance theplanet is heading toward a truly major disaster and delay means passing a point of no return, inaction now isfoolhardy. Call this Noah’s Law: If an ark may be essential for survival , begin building it today, no matter how\ncloudless the skies appear.\nIt’s understandable that the sponsor of the proxy proposal believes Berkshire is especially threatened by\nclimate change because we are a huge insurer, covering all sorts of risks. The sponsor may worry that propertylosses will skyrocket because of weather changes. And such worries might, in fact, be warranted if we wrote ten- ortwenty-year policies at fixed prices. But insurance policies are customarily written for one year and repricedannually to reflect changing exposures. Increased possibilities of loss translate promptly into increased premiums.\n25\n\nThink back to 1951 when I first became enthused about GEICO. The company’s average loss-per-policy\nwas then about $30 annually. Imagine your reaction if I had predicted then that in 2015 the loss costs would increaseto about $1,000 per policy. Wouldn’t such skyrocketing losses prove disastrous, you might ask? Well, no.\nOver the years, inflation has caused a huge increase in the cost of repairing both the cars and the humans\ninvolved in accidents. But these increased costs have been promptly matched by increased premiums. So,paradoxically, the upward march in loss costs has made insurance companies far more valuable . If costs had\nremained unchanged, Berkshire would now own an auto insurer doing $600 million of business annually rather thanone doing $23 billion.\nUp to now, climate change has notproduced more frequent nor more costly hurricanes nor other weather-\nrelated events covered by insurance. As a consequence, U.S. super-cat rates have fallen steadily in recent years,\nwhich is why we have backed away from that business. If super-cats become costlier and more frequent, the likely –though far from certain – effect on Berkshire’s insurance business would be to make it larger and more profitable.\nAs a citizen, you may understandably find climate change keeping you up nights. As a homeowner in a\nlow-lying area, you may wish to consider moving. But when you are thinking only as a shareholder of a majorinsurer, climate change should not be on your list of worries.\nThe Annual Meeting\nCharlie and I have finally decided to enter the 21\nstCentury. Our annual meeting this year will be webcast\nworldwide in its entirety. To view the meeting, simply go to https://finance.yahoo.com/brklivestream at 9 a.m.Central Daylight Time on Saturday, April 30\nth. The Yahoo! webcast will begin with a half hour of interviews with\nmanagers, directors and shareholders. Then, at 9:30, Charlie and I will commence answering questions.\nThis new arrangement will serve two purposes. First, it may level off or modestly decrease attendance at\nthe meeting. Last year’s record of more than 40,000 attendees strained our capacity. In addition to quickly filling theCenturyLink Center’s main arena, we packed its overflow rooms and then spilled into two large meeting rooms atthe adjoining Omaha Hilton. All major hotels were sold out notwithstanding Airbnb’s stepped-up presence. Airbnbwas especially helpful for those visitors on limited budgets.\nOur second reason for initiating a webcast is more important. Charlie is 92, and I am 85. If we were\npartners with you in a small business, and were charged with running the place, you would want to look inoccasionally to make sure we hadn’t drifted off into la-la land. Shareholders, in contrast, should not need to come toOmaha to monitor how we look and sound. (In making your evaluation, be kind: Allow for the fact that we didn’tlook that impressive when we were at our best.)\nViewers can also observe our life-prolonging diet. During the meeting, Charlie and I will each consume\nenough Coke, See’s fudge and See’s peanut brittle to satisfy the weekly caloric needs of an NFL lineman. Long agowe discovered a fundamental truth: There’s nothing like eating carrots and broccoli when you’re really hungry –\nand want to stay that way.\nShareholders planning to attend the meeting should come at 7 a.m. when the doors open at CenturyLink\nCenter and start shopping . Carrie Sova will again be in charge of the festivities. She had her second child late last\nmonth, but that did not slow her down. Carrie is unflappable, ingenious and expert at bringing out the best in thosewho work with her. She is aided by hundreds of Berkshire employees from around the country and by our entirehome office crew as well, all of them pitching in to make the weekend fun and informative for our owners.\n26\n\nLast year we increased the number of hours available for shopping at the CenturyLink. Sales skyrocketed –\nso, naturally, we will stay with the new schedule. On Friday, April 29thyou can shop between noon and 5 p.m., and\non Saturday exhibits and stores will be open from 7 a.m. until 4:30 p.m.\nOn Saturday morning, we will have our fifth International Newspaper Tossing Challenge. Our target will\nagain be a Clayton Home porch, located precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. When I was a teenager – in myone brief flirtation with honest labor – I delivered about 500,000 papers. So I think I’m pretty good at this game.Challenge me! Humiliate me! Knock me down a peg! The papers will run 36 to 42 pages, and you must fold themyourself (no rubber bands allowed).\nThe competition begins at 7:15, when contestants will make preliminary tosses. The eight throws judged\nmost accurate – four made by contestants 12 or under, and four made by the older set – will compete against me at7:45. The young challengers will each receive a prize. But the older ones will have to beat me to take anythinghome.\nAnd be sure to check out the Clayton home itself. It can be purchased for $78,900, fully installed on land\nyou provide. In past years, we’ve made many sales on the meeting day. Kevin Clayton will be on hand with hisorder book.\nAt 8:30 a.m., a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answer\nperiod, which (including a break for lunch at CenturyLink’s stands) will last until 3:30 p.m. After a short recess,Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45 p.m. This business session typically lasts only a half hour orso and can safely be skipped by those craving a little last-minute shopping.\nYour venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in which\nproducts from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries will be for sale. Say hello to the many Berkshire managers who willbe captaining their exhibits. And be sure to view the terrific BNSF railroad layout that salutes all of our subsidiaries.Your children (and you!) will be enchanted with it.\nWe will have a new and very special exhibit in the hall this year: a full-size model of the world’s largest\naircraft engine, for which Precision Castparts makes many key components. The real engines weigh about 20,000pounds and are ten feet in diameter and 22 feet in length. The bisected model at the meeting will give you a goodlook at many PCC components that help power your flights.\nBrooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at the meeting.\nAfter you purchase a pair, wear them on Sunday at our fourth annual “Berkshire 5K,” an 8 a.m. race starting at theCenturyLink. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor’s Guide that will be sent to you with yourmeeting credentials. Entrants in the race will find themselves running alongside many of Berkshire’s managers,directors and associates. (Charlie and I, however, will sleep in; the fudge and peanut brittle take their toll.)Participation in the 5K grows every year. Help us set another record.\nA GEICO booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company’s top counselors from\naround the country. Stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount(usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplementalpoint: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another discount, such as that available to certain groups.)Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out our price. We can save many of you real money. Spendthe savings on our other products.\n27\n\nBe sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry about 35 books and DVDs, among them a couple of new titles.\nAndy Kilpatrick will introduce (and be glad to sign) the latest edition of his all-encompassing coverage ofBerkshire. It’s 1,304 pages and weighs 9.8 pounds. (My blurb for the book: “Ridiculously skimpy.”) Check outPeter Bevelin’s new book as well. Peter has long been a keen observer of Berkshire.\nWe will also have a new, 20-page-longer edition of Berkshire’s 50-year commemorative book that at last\nyear’s meeting sold 12,000 copies. Since then, Carrie and I have uncovered additional material that we findfascinating, such as some very personal letters sent by Grover Cleveland to Edward Butler, his friend and the then-publisher of The Buffalo News . Nothing from the original edition has been changed or eliminated, and the price\nremains $20. Charlie and I will jointly sign 100 copies that will be randomly placed among the 5,000 available forsale at the meeting.\nMy friend, Phil Beuth, has written Limping on Water , an autobiography that chronicles his life at Capital\nCities Communications and tells you a lot about its leaders, Tom Murphy and Dan Burke. These two were the bestmanagerial duo – both in what they accomplished and howthey did it – that Charlie and I ever witnessed. Much of\nwhat you become in life depends on whom you choose to admire and copy. Start with Tom Murphy, and you’llnever need a second exemplar.\nFinally, Jeremy Miller has written Warren Buffett’s Ground Rules , a book that will debut at the annual\nmeeting. Mr. Miller has done a superb job of researching and dissecting the operation of Buffett Partnership Ltd.and of explaining how Berkshire’s culture has evolved from its BPL origin. If you are fascinated by investmenttheory and practice, you will enjoy this book.\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to both the meeting and other events. Airlines have sometimes jacked upprices for the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City vs.Omaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2\n1⁄2hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you\nsignificant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. The savings for a couple could run to$1,000 or more. Spend that money with us.\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72\nndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we will\nagain be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. Last year in the week encompassing the meeting, the storedid a record $44,239,493 of business. If you repeat that figure to a retailer, he is not going to believe you. (Anaverage week for NFM’s Omaha store – the highest-volume home furnishings store in the United States except forour new Dallas store – is about $9 million.)\nTo obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, April 26\nthand\nMonday, May 2ndinclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even apply to\nthe products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, inthe spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. During“Berkshire Weekend” NFM will be open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. onSaturday and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday. From 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday, NFM is hosting a picnic to whichyou are all invited.\nAt Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from 6\np.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, April 29\nth. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 1st, from 9 a.m. to 4\np.m. On Saturday, we will remain open until 6 p.m. During last year’s Friday-Sunday stretch, the store wrote a salesticket every 15 seconds that it was open.\n28\n\nWe will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 25ththrough Saturday, May 7th. During that period, please\nidentify yourself as a shareholder either by presenting your meeting credential or a brokerage statement showingyou own our stock.\nOn Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, Norman Beck, a remarkable magician from Dallas, will\nbewilder onlookers. On the upper level, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the world’s topbridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. I will join them and hope tohave Ajit and Charlie there also.\nMy friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. I met\nAriel when she was nine and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Now, she’s a junior at Princeton,having already represented the United States in the 2012 Olympics. If you don’t mind embarrassing yourself, testyour skills against her, beginning at 1 p.m. Bill Gates and I will lead off and try to soften her up.\nGorat’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 1\nst, serving from 1 p.m.\nuntil 10 p.m. To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call 402-551-3733 on April 1st(but not before ). As for my other\nfavorite restaurant, Piccolo’s, I’m sad to report it closed.\nWe will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the meeting,\nasking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, the preeminent business journalist of her time, who may be e-mailed atloomisbrk@gmail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, ofThe New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.\nFrom the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most interesting\nand important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you keep itconcise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than two questions inany e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if yourquestion is asked.)\nAn accompanying set of questions will be asked by three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the\ninsurance specialist will be Cliff Gallant of Nomura Securities. Questions that deal with our non-insuranceoperations will come from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Ourhope is that the analysts and journalists will ask questions that add to our owners’ understanding and knowledge oftheir investment.\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough,\nfor sure, and that’s the way we like it. Multi-part questions aren’t allowed; we want to give as many questioners aspossible a shot at us.\nAll told we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and for\n18 from the audience. (Last year we had 64 in total.) The questioners from the audience will be chosen by means of11 drawings that will take place at 8:15 a.m. on the morning of the annual meeting. Each of the 11 microphonesinstalled in the arena and main overflow room will host, so to speak, a drawing.\n29\n\nWhile I’m on the subject of our owners’ gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believe\nall shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and, if possible,should also have adequate time to digest and analyze it before any trading takes place. That’s why we try to issuefinancial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on a Saturday. Wedo not follow the common practice of talking one-on-one with large institutional investors or analysts, treating theminstead as we do all other shareholders. There is no one more important to us than the shareholder of limited meanswho trusts us with a substantial portion of his savings.\n************\nFor good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-Stars\nwho run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I also believe the mindset of ourmanagers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most ofour managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business “home runs” means as much to them astheir paycheck.\nEqually important, however, are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office. This\ngroup efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 30,400-page Federalincome tax return – that’s up 6,000 pages from the prior year! – oversees the filing of 3,530 state tax returns,responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country’s largestannual meeting, coordinates the Board’s activities, fact-checks this letter – and the list goes on and on.\nThey handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy\nand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year, for example, they dealt withthe 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They alsohandle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and french fries(smothered in Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly do feel like tap dancing to workevery day. In fact, my job becomes more fun every year.\nIn 2015, Berkshire’s revenues increased by $16 billion. Look carefully, however, at the two pictures on the\nfacing page. The top one is from last year’s report and shows the entire Berkshire home-office crew at ourChristmas lunch. Below that photo is this year’s Christmas photo portraying the same 25 people identically\npositioned. In 2015, no one joined us, no one left. And the odds are good that you will see a photo of the same 25next year.\nCan you imagine another very large company – we employ 361,270 people worldwide – enjoying that kind\nof employment stability at headquarters? At Berkshire we have hired some wonderful people – and they have stayedwith us. Moreover, no one is hired unless he or she is truly needed. That’s why you’ve never read about“restructuring” charges at Berkshire.\nOn April 30\nth, come to Omaha – the cradle of capitalism – and meet my gang. They are the best.\nFebruary 27, 2016 Warren E.

Starting in 1979,\naccounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market rather than at the lower of cost or market, which\nwas previously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire’s results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all otherrespects, the results are calculated using the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are\nafter-tax . If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have\nlagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed anegative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n2\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshire’s gain in net worth during 2016 was $27.5 billion, which increased the per-share book value\nof both our Class A and Class B stock by 10.7%. Over the last 52 years (that is, since present management took\nover), per-share book value has grown from $19 to $172,108, a rate of 19% compounded annually.*\nDuring the first half of those years, Berkshire’s net worth was roughly equal to the number that really\ncounts: the intrinsic value of the business. The similarity of the two figures existed then because most of ourresources were deployed in marketable securities that were regularly revalued to their quoted prices (less the taxthat would be incurred if they were to be sold). In Wall Street parlance, our balance sheet was then in very largepart “marked to market.”\nBy the early 1990s, however, our focus was changing to the outright ownership of businesses, a shift\nthat materially diminished the relevance of balance sheet figures. That disconnect occurred because theaccounting rules (commonly referred to as “GAAP”) that apply to companies we control differ in important waysfrom those used to value marketable securities. Specifically, the accounting for businesses we own requires that\nthe carrying value of “losers” be written down when their failures become apparent. “Winners,” conversely, arenever revalued upwards.\nWe’ve experienced both outcomes: As is the case in marriage, business acquisitions often deliver\nsurprises after the “I do’s.” I’ve made some dumb purchases, paying far too much for the economic goodwill of\ncompanies we acquired. That later led to goodwill write-offs and to consequent reductions in Berkshire’s bookvalue. We’ve also had some winners among the businesses we’ve purchased – a few of the winners very big –but have not written those up by a penny.\nWe have no quarrel with the asymmetrical accounting that applies here. But, over time, it necessarily\nwidens the gap between Berkshire’s intrinsic value and its book value. Today, the large – and growing –unrecorded gains at our winners produce an intrinsic value for Berkshire’s shares that farexceeds their book\nvalue. The overage is truly huge in our property/casualty insurance business and significant also in many otheroperations.\nOver time, stock prices gravitate toward intrinsic value. That’s what has happened at Berkshire, a fact\nexplaining why the company’s 52-year market-price gain – shown on the facing page – materially exceeds itsbook-value gain.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500\nthof\nthose shown for A.\n3\n\nWhat We Hope to Accomplish\nCharlie Munger, Berkshire’s Vice Chairman and my partner, and I expect Berkshire’s normalized\nearning power per share to increase every year. Actual earnings, of course, will sometimes decline because of\nperiodic weakness in the U.S. economy. In addition, insurance mega-catastrophes or other industry-specific\nevents may occasionally reduce earnings at Berkshire, even when most American businesses are doing well.\nIt’s our job, though, to over time deliver significant growth, bumpy or not. After all, as stewards of your\ncapital, Berkshire directors have opted to retain all earnings. Indeed, in both 2015 and 2016 Berkshire rankedfirst among American businesses in the dollar volume of earnings retained, in each year reinvesting manybillions of dollars more than did the runner-up. Those reinvested dollars must earn their keep.\nSome years, the gains in underlying earning power we achieve will be minor; very occasionally, the\ncash register will ring loud. Charlie and I have no magic plan to add earnings except to dream big and to beprepared mentally and financially to act fast when opportunities present themselves. Every decade or so, darkclouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold. When downpours of that sort occur, it’simperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.\nI earlier described our gradual shift from a company obtaining most of its gains from investment\nactivities to one that grows in value by owning businesses. Launching that transition, we took baby steps –making small acquisitions whose impact on Berkshire’s profits was dwarfed by our gains from marketablesecurities. Despite that cautious approach, I made one particularly egregious error, acquiring Dexter Shoe for$434 million in 1993. Dexter’s value promptly went to zero. The story gets worse: I used stock for the purchase,giving the sellers 25,203 shares of Berkshire that at yearend 2016 were worth more than $6 billion.\nThat wreck was followed by three key happenings – two positive, one negative – that set us firmly on\nour present course. At the beginning of 1996, we acquired the half of GEICO we didn’t already own, a cashtransaction that changed our holding from a portfolio investment into a wholly-owned operating business.GEICO, with its almost unlimited potential, quickly became the centerpiece around which we built what I believeis now the world’s premier property/casualty business.\nUnfortunately, I followed the GEICO purchase by foolishly using Berkshire stock – a boatload of\nstock – to buy General Reinsurance in late 1998. After some early problems, General Re has become a fineinsurance operation that we prize. It was, nevertheless, a terrible mistake on my part to issue 272,200 shares ofBerkshire in buying General Re, an act that increased our outstanding shares by a whopping 21.8%. My errorcaused Berkshire shareholders to give far more than they received (a practice that – despite the Biblicalendorsement – is far from blessed when you are buying businesses).\nEarly in 2000, I atoned for that folly by buying 76% (since grown to 90%) of MidAmerican Energy, a\nbrilliantly-managed utility business that has delivered us many large opportunities to make profitable andsocially-useful investments. The MidAmerican cash purchase – I was learning – firmly launched us on our\npresent course of (1) continuing to build our insurance operation; (2) energetically acquiring large and diversifiednon-insurance businesses and (3) largely making our deals from internally-generated cash. (Today, I would ratherprep for a colonoscopy than issue Berkshire shares.)\nOur portfolio of bonds and stocks, de-emphasized though it is, has continued in the post-1998 period to\ngrow and to deliver us hefty capital gains, interest, and dividends. Those portfolio earnings have provided usmajor help in financing the purchase of businesses. Though unconventional, Berkshire’s two-pronged approachto capital allocation gives us a real edge.\n4\n\nHere’s our financial record since 1999, when the redirection of our business began in earnest. During\nthe 18-year period covered, Berkshire’s outstanding shares grew by only 8.3%, with most of the increase\noccurring when we purchased BNSF. That, I’m happy to say, was one issuance of stock that made good sense.\nAfter-Tax Earnings\n(in billions of dollars)\nYear Operations (1)Capital\nGains (2) Year Operations (1)Capital\nGains (2)\n1999 0.67 0.89 2008 9.64 (4.65)\n2000 0.94 2.39 2009 7.57 0.49\n2001 (0.13) 0.92 2010 11.09 1.87\n2002 3.72 0.57 2011 10.78 (0.52)\n2003 5.42 2.73 2012 12.60 2.23\n2004 5.05 2.26 2013 15.14 4.34\n2005 5.00 3.53 2014 16.55 3.32\n2006 9.31 1.71 2015 17.36 6.73\n2007 9.63 3.58 2016 17.57 6.50\n(1) Including interest and dividends from investments, but excluding capital gains or losses.\n(2) In very large part, this tabulation includes only realized capital gains or losses. Unrealized gains and\nlosses are also included, however, when GAAP requires that treatment.\nOur expectation is that investment gains will continue to be substantial – though totally random as to\ntiming – and that these will supply significant funds for business purchases. Concurrently, Berkshire’s superb\ncorps of operating CEOs will focus on increasing earnings at the individual businesses they manage, sometimeshelping them to grow by making bolt-on acquisitions. By our avoiding the issuance of Berkshire stock, anyimprovement in earnings will translate into equivalent per-share gains.\n************\nOur efforts to materially increase the normalized earnings of Berkshire will be aided – as they have been\nthroughout our managerial tenure – by America’s economic dynamism. One word sums up our country’sachievements: miraculous. From a standing start 240 years ago – a span of time less than triple my days onearth – Americans have combined human ingenuity, a market system, a tide of talented and ambitiousimmigrants, and the rule of law to deliver abundance beyond any dreams of our forefathers.\nYou need not be an economist to understand how well our system has worked. Just look around you.\nSee the 75 million owner-occupied homes, the bountiful farmland, the 260 million vehicles, the hyper-productivefactories, the great medical centers, the talent-filled universities, you name it – they all represent a net gain forAmericans from the barren lands, primitive structures and meager output of 1776. Starting from scratch, Americahas amassed wealth totaling $90 trillion.\n5\n\nIt’s true, of course, that American owners of homes, autos and other assets have often borrowed heavily\nto finance their purchases. If an owner defaults, however, his or her asset does not disappear or lose its\nusefulness. Rather, ownership customarily passes to an American lending institution that then disposes of it to anAmerican buyer. Our nation’s wealth remains intact. As Gertrude Stein put it, “Money is always there, but the\npockets change.”\nAbove all, it’s our market system – an economic traffic cop ably directing capital, brains and labor –\nthat has created America’s abundance. This system has also been the primary factor in allocating rewards.Governmental redirection, through federal, state and local taxation, has in addition determined the distribution ofa significant portion of the bounty.\nAmerica has, for example, decided that those citizens in their productive years should help both the old\nand the young. Such forms of aid – sometimes enshrined as “entitlements” – are generally thought of as applyingto the aged. But don’t forget that four million American babies are born each year with an entitlement to a publiceducation. That societal commitment, largely financed at the local level, costs about $150,000 per baby. Theannual cost totals more than $600 billion, which is about 3\n1⁄2% of GDP.\nHowever our wealth may be divided, the mind-boggling amounts you see around you belong almost\nexclusively to Americans. Foreigners, of course, own or have claims on a modest portion of our wealth. Thoseholdings, however, are of little importance to our national balance sheet: Ourcitizens own assets abroad that are\nroughly comparable in value.\nEarly Americans, we should emphasize, were neither smarter nor more hard working than those people\nwho toiled century after century before them. But those venturesome pioneers crafted a system that unleashedhuman potential, and their successors built upon it.\nThis economic creation will deliver increasing wealth to our progeny far into the future. Yes, the\nbuild-up of wealth will be interrupted for short periods from time to time. It will not ,however, be stopped. I’ll\nrepeat what I’ve both said in the past and expect to say in future years: Babies born in America today are theluckiest crop in history.\n************\nAmerica’s economic achievements have led to staggering profits for stockholders. During the 20\nth\ncentury the Dow-Jones Industrials advanced from 66 to 11,497, a 17,320% capital gain that was materiallyboosted by steadily increasing dividends. The trend continues: By yearend 2016, the index had advanced afurther 72%, to 19,763.\nAmerican business – and consequently a basket of stocks – is virtually certain to be worth far more in\nthe years ahead. Innovation, productivity gains, entrepreneurial spirit and an abundance of capital will see to that.Ever-present naysayers may prosper by marketing their gloomy forecasts. But heaven help them if they act on thenonsense they peddle.\nMany companies, of course, will fall behind, and some will fail. Winnowing of that sort is a product of\nmarket dynamism. Moreover, the years ahead will occasionally deliver major market declines – even panics –that will affect virtually all stocks. No one can tell you when these traumas will occur – not me, not Charlie, noteconomists, not the media. Meg McConnell of the New York Fed aptly described the reality of panics: “Wespend a lot of time looking for systemic risk; in truth, however, it tends to find us.”\nDuring such scary periods, you should never forget two things: First, widespread fear is your friend as\nan investor, because it serves up bargain purchases. Second, personal fear is your enemy. It will also be\nunwarranted. Investors who avoid high and unnecessary costs and simply sit for an extended period with acollection of large, conservatively-financed American businesses will almost certainly do well.\nAs for Berkshire, our size precludes a brilliant result: Prospective returns fall as assets increase.\nNonetheless, Berkshire’s collection of good businesses, along with the company’s impregnable financial strengthand owner-oriented culture, should deliver decent results. We won’t be satisfied with less.\n6\n\nShare Repurchases\nIn the investment world, discussions about share repurchases often become heated. But I’d suggest that\nparticipants in this debate take a deep breath: Assessing the desirability of repurchases isn’t that complicated.\nFrom the standpoint of exiting shareholders, repurchases are always a plus. Though the day-to-day impact of\nthese purchases is usually minuscule, it’s always better for a seller to have an additional buyer in the market.\nFor continuing shareholders, however, repurchases only make sense if the shares are bought at a price\nbelow intrinsic value. When that rule is followed, the remaining shares experience an immediate gain in intrinsic\nvalue. Consider a simple analogy: If there are three equal partners in a business worth $3,000 and one is boughtout by the partnership for $900, each of the remaining partners realizes an immediate gain of $50. If the exitingpartner is paid $1,100, however, the continuing partners each suffer a loss of $50. The same math applies withcorporations and their shareholders. Ergo, the question of whether a repurchase action is value-enhancing orvalue-destroying for continuing shareholders is entirely purchase-price dependent.\nIt is puzzling, therefore, that corporate repurchase announcements almost never refer to a price above\nwhich repurchases will be eschewed. That certainly wouldn’t be the case if a management was buying an outsidebusiness. There, price would always factor into a buy-or-pass decision.\nWhen CEOs or boards are buying a small part of their own company, though, they all too often seem\noblivious to price. Would they behave similarly if they were managing a private company with just a few ownersand were evaluating the wisdom of buying out one of them? Of course not.\nIt is important to remember that there are two occasions in which repurchases should not take place,\neven if the company’s shares are underpriced. One is when a business both needs all its available money toprotect or expand its own operations and is also uncomfortable adding further debt. Here, the internal need forfunds should take priority. This exception assumes, of course, that the business has a decent future awaiting itafter the needed expenditures are made.\nThe second exception, less common, materializes when a business acquisition (or some other investment\nopportunity) offers far greater value than do the undervalued shares of the potential repurchaser. Long ago,Berkshire itself often had to choose between these alternatives. At our present size, the issue is far less likely toarise.\nMy suggestion: Before even discussing repurchases, a CEO and his or her Board should stand, join\nhands and in unison declare, “What is smart at one price is stupid at another.”\n************\nTo recap Berkshire’s own repurchase policy: I am authorized to buy large amounts of Berkshire shares at\n120% or less of book value because our Board has concluded that purchases at that level clearly bring an instant andmaterial benefit to continuing shareholders. By our estimate, a 120%-of-book price is a significant discount toBerkshire’s intrinsic value, a spread that is appropriate because calculations of intrinsic value can’t be precise.\nThe authorization given me does not mean that we will “prop” our stock’s price at the 120% ratio. If\nthat level is reached, we will instead attempt to blend a desire to make meaningful purchases at a value-creatingprice with a related goal of not over-influencing the market.\nTo date, repurchasing our shares has proved hard to do. That may well be because we have been clear in\ndescribing our repurchase policy and thereby have signaled our view that Berkshire’s intrinsic value issignificantly higher than 120% of book value. If so, that’s fine. Charlie and I prefer to see Berkshire shares sell ina fairly narrow range around intrinsic value, neither wishing them to sell at an unwarranted high price – it’s nofun having owners who are disappointed with their purchases – nor one too low. Furthermore, our buying out“partners” at a discount is not a particularly gratifying way of making money. Still, market circumstances couldcreate a situation in which repurchases would benefit both continuing and exiting shareholders. If so, we will beready to act.\n7\n\nOne final observation for this section: As the subject of repurchases has come to a boil, some people\nhave come close to calling them un-American – characterizing them as corporate misdeeds that divert funds\nneeded for productive endeavors. That simply isn’t the case: Both American corporations and private investorsare today awash in funds looking to be sensibly deployed. I’m not aware of anyenticing project that in recent\nyears has died for lack of capital. (Call us if you have a candidate.)\nInsurance\nLet’s now look at Berkshire’s various businesses, starting with our most important sector, insurance.\nThe property/casualty (“P/C”) branch of that industry has been the engine that has propelled our growth since\n1967, the year we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire & Marine, for $8.6 million.Today, National Indemnity is the largest property/casualty company in the world as measured by net worth.\nOne reason we were attracted to the P/C business was its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receive\npremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos,payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding largesums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float fortheir own benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holdsusually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does ourfloat. And howit has grown, as the following table shows:\nYear\nFloat (in millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322016 91,577\nWe recently wrote a huge policy that increased float to more than $100 billion. Beyond that one-time\nboost, float at GEICO and several of our specialized operations is almost certain to grow at a good clip. NationalIndemnity’s reinsurance division, however, is party to a number of large run-off contracts whose float is certainto drift downward.\nWe may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be very gradual – at the outside no\nmore than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to\nimmediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. This structure is bydesign and is a key component in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. It will never be\ncompromised.\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers\nan underwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, weenjoy the use of free money – and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so\nvigorous indeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss.\nThis loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that theinsurance industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earningsubnormal returns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses.\n8\n\nThis outcome is made more certain by the dramatically lower interest rates that now exist throughout the\nworld. The investment portfolios of almost all P/C companies – though notthose of Berkshire – are heavily\nconcentrated in bonds. As these high-yielding legacy investments mature and are replaced by bonds yielding a\npittance, earnings from float will steadily fall. For that reason, and others as well, it’s a good bet that industryresults over the next ten years will fall short of those recorded in the past decade, particularly in the case ofcompanies that specialize in reinsurance.\nNevertheless, I very much like our own prospects. Berkshire’s unrivaled financial strength allows us far\nmore flexibility in investing than that generally available to P/C companies. The many alternatives available to usare always an advantage; occasionally, they offer us major opportunities. When others are constrained, ourchoices expand.\nMoreover, our P/C companies have an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at an\nunderwriting profit for 14 consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $28 billion. Thatrecord is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of allof our insurance managers, who know\nthat while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give thatmessage lip service. At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.\nSo how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire’s book value is calculated, the fullamount\nof our float is deducted as a liability , just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to\nthink of float as a typical liability is a major mistake. It should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, wepay old claims and related expenses – a huge $27 billion to more than six million claimants in 2016 – and thatreduces float. Just as surely, we each day write new business that will soon generate its own claims, adding tofloat.\nIf our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this\nliability is dramatically less than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises –\nbecause new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute – is worlds different from owing $1 that will go outthe door tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities, however, are treated as equals under GAAP.\nA partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion “goodwill” asset that we incurred in buying\nour insurance companies and that is included in our book-value figure. In very large part, this goodwill representsthe price we paid for the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill,however, has nobearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged\nunderwriting losses, anygoodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original\ncost.\nFortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\ninsurance goodwill – what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance\noperation possessing it – to be farin excess of its historic carrying value. Indeed, almost the entire $15.5 billion\nwe carry for goodwill in our insurance business was already on our books in 2000 when float was $28 billion.Yet we have subsequently increased our float by $64 billion, a gain that in no way is reflected in our book value.This unrecorded asset is one reason – a huge reason – why we believe Berkshire’s intrinsic business value farexceeds its book value.\n************\nBerkshire’s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running\ndisciplined operations that in most cases possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about themajor units.\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures\nrisks that no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed,decisiveness and, most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposesBerkshire to risks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources.\n9\n\nIndeed, Berkshire is farmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if the\ninsurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe – a loss about triple\nanything it has ever experienced – Berkshire as a whole would likely record a large profit for the year. Our manystreams of non-insurance earnings would see to that. Additionally, we would remain awash in cash and be eagerto write business in an insurance market that might well be in disarray. Meanwhile, other major insurers andreinsurers would be swimming in red ink, if not facing insolvency.\nWhen Ajit entered Berkshire’s office on a Saturday in 1986, he did not have a day’s experience in the\ninsurance business. Nevertheless, Mike Goldberg, then our manager of insurance, handed him the keys to oursmall and struggling reinsurance business. With that move, Mike achieved sainthood: Since then, Ajit has createdtens of billions of value for Berkshire shareholders. If there were ever to be another Ajit and you could swap mefor him, don’t hesitate . Make the trade!\n************\nWe have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed until recently by Tad Montross. After\n39 years at General Re, Tad retired in 2016. Tad was a class act in every way and we owe him a ton of thanks.Kara Raiguel, who has worked with Ajit for 16 years, is now CEO of General Re.\nAt bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposureactually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profitafter both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if theappropriate premium can’t be obtained.\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can’t turn their back on\nbusiness that is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, “The other guy is doing it, so we mustas well,” spells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance. Tad never listened to thatnonsensical excuse for sloppy underwriting, and neither will Kara.\n************\nFinally, there is GEICO, the company that set my heart afire 66 years ago (and for which the flame still\nburns). GEICO is managed by Tony Nicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 55 years of service in2016.\nTony became CEO of GEICO in 1993, and since then the company has been flying. There is nobetter\nmanager than Tony, who brings his combination of brilliance, dedication andsoundness to the job. (The latter\nquality is essential to sustained success. As Charlie says, it’s great to have a manager with a 160 IQ – unless hethinks it’s 180.) Like Ajit, Tony has created tens of billions of value for Berkshire.\nOn my initial visit to GEICO in 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage the company\nenjoyed over the giants of the industry. It was clear to me that GEICO would succeed because it deserved to\nsucceed. The company’s annual sales were then $8 million; In 2016, GEICO did that much business every threehours of the year.\nAuto insurance is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them – and only a low-cost\noperation can deliver those. In fact, at least 40% of the people reading this letter can save money by insuring withGEICO. So stop reading – right now! – and go to geico.com or call 800-847-7536.\nGEICO’s low costs create a moat – an enduring one – that competitors are unable to cross. As a result,\nthe company gobbles up market share year after year, ending 2016 with about 12% of industry volume. That’s upfrom 2.5% in 1995, the year Berkshire acquired control of GEICO. Employment, meanwhile, grew from 8,575 to36,085.\n10\n\nGEICO’s growth accelerated dramatically during the second half of 2016. Loss costs throughout the\nauto-insurance industry had been increasing at an unexpected pace and some competitors lost their enthusiasm\nfor taking on new customers. GEICO’s reaction to the profit squeeze, however, was to accelerate its\nnew-business efforts. We like to make hay while the sun sets, knowing that it will surely rise again.\nGEICO continues on a roll as I send you this letter. When insurance prices increase, people shop more.\nAnd when they shop, GEICO wins.\nHave you called yet? (800-847-7536 or go to geico.com)\n************\nIn addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a collection of smaller companies that\nprimarily write commercial coverages. In aggregate, these companies are a large, growing and valuable operationthat consistently delivers an underwriting profit, usually one much superior to that reported by their competitors.Over the past 14 years, this group has earned $4.7 billion from underwriting – about 13% of its premiumvolume – while increasing its float from $943 million to $11.6 billion.\nLess than three years ago, we formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BHSI”), which is\nincluded in this grouping. Our first decision was to put Peter Eastwood in charge, a move that proved to be ahome run: We expected significant losses in the early years while Peter built the personnel and infrastructureneeded for a world-wide operation. Instead, he and his crew delivered significant underwriting profits throughoutthe start-up period. BHSI’s volume increased 40% in 2016, reaching $1.3 billion. It’s clear to me that thecompany is destined to become one of the world’s leading P/C insurers.\nHere’s a recap of pre-tax underwriting earnings and float by division:\nUnderwriting Profit\nYearend Float\n(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2016 2015 2016 2015\nBH Reinsurance .................................... $ 822 $ 421 $ 45,081 $ 44,108\nGeneral Re ........................................... 190 132 17,699 18,560\nGEICO ................................................ 462 460 17,148 15,148\nOther Primary ....................................... 657 824 11,649 9,906\n$2,131 $1,837 $ 91,577 $ 87,722\nBerkshire’s great managers, premier financial strength and a range of business models protected by wide\nmoats amount to something unique in the insurance world. This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset forBerkshire shareholders that time will only make more valuable.\nRegulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\nOur BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”), our 90%-owned utility business, share\nimportant characteristics that distinguish them from Berkshire’s other activities. Consequently, we assign them\ntheir own section in this letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet andincome statement. These two very major companies accounted for 33% of Berkshire’s after-tax operatingearnings last year.\n11\n\nA key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets,\nwith these partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is\nin fact not needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions would\nfar exceed its interest requirements. Last year, for example, in a disappointing year for railroads, BNSF’s interestcoverage was more than 6:1. (Our definition of coverage is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes tointerest, notEBITDA/interest, a commonly-used measure we view as seriously flawed.)\nAt BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company’s ability to service its debt under all\ncircumstances. The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from thesecompanies offering an essential service for which demand is remarkably steady. The second is enjoyed by fewother utilities: an ever-widening diversity of earnings streams, which shield BHE from being seriously harmed byany single regulatory body. These many sources of profit, supplemented by the inherent advantage of thecompany being owned by a strong parent, have allowed BHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lowertheir cost of debt. That economic fact benefits both us andour customers.\nAll told, BHE and BNSF invested $8.9 billion in plant and equipment last year, a massive commitment\nto their segments of America’s infrastructure. We relish making such investments as long as they promisereasonable returns – and, on that front, we put a large amount of trust in future regulation.\nOur confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever\nneed huge investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capitalproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in ourself-interest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people theyrepresent.\nLow prices are a powerful way to keep these constituencies happy. In Iowa, BHE’s average retail rate is\n7.1¢ per KWH. Alliant, the other major electric utility in the state, averages 9.9¢. Here are the comparableindustry figures for adjacent states: Nebraska 9.0¢, Missouri 9.5¢, Illinois 9.2¢, Minnesota 10.0¢. The nationalaverage is 10.3¢. We have promised Iowans that our base rates will not increase until 2029 at the earliest . Our\nrock-bottom prices add up to real money for paycheck-strapped customers.\nAt BNSF, price comparisons between major railroads are far more difficult to make because of\nsignificant differences in both their mix of cargo and the average distance the load is carried. To supply a very\ncrude measure, however, our revenue per ton-mile was 3¢ last year, while shipping costs for customers of theother four major U.S.-based railroads ranged from 4¢ to 5¢.\nBoth BHE and BNSF have been leaders in pursuing planet-friendly technology. In wind generation, no\nstate comes close to rivaling Iowa, where last year the megawatt-hours we generated from wind equaled 55% ofall megawatt-hours sold to our Iowa retail customers. New wind projects that are underway will take that figureto 89% by 2020.\nBargain-basement electric rates carry second-order benefits with them. Iowa has attracted large high-\ntech installations, both because of its low prices for electricity (which data centers use in huge quantities) andbecause most tech CEOs are enthusiastic about using renewable energy. When it comes to wind energy, Iowa isthe Saudi Arabia of America.\nBNSF, like other Class I railroads, uses only a single gallon of diesel fuel to move a ton of freight\nalmost 500 miles. Those economics make railroads four times as fuel-efficient as trucks! Furthermore, railroadsalleviate highway congestion – and the taxpayer-funded maintenance expenditures that come with heaviertraffic – in a major way.\n12\n\nAll told, BHE and BNSF own assets that are of major importance to our country as well as to\nshareholders of Berkshire. Here are the key financial figures for both:\nBNSF Earnings (in millions)\n2016 2015 2014\nRevenues .................................................................................. $ 19,829 $ 21,967 $ 23,239\nOperating expenses .................................................................... 13,144 14,264 16,237\nOperating earnings before interest and taxes .................................... 6,685 7,703 7,002\nInterest (net) ............................................................................. 992 928 833\nIncome taxes ............................................................................. 2,124 2,527 2,300\nNet earnings .............................................................................. $ 3,569 $ 4,248 $ 3,869\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy (90% owned) Earnings (in millions)\n2016 2015 2014\nU.K. utilities ............................................................................. $ 367 $ 460 $ 527\nIowa utility ............................................................................... 392 292 270\nNevada utilities ......................................................................... 559 586 549\nPacifiCorp (primarily Oregon and Utah) ......................................... 1,105 1,026 1,010\nGas pipelines (Northern Natural and Kern River) ............................. 413 401 379\nCanadian transmission utility ....................................................... 147 170 16\nRenewable projects .................................................................... 157 175 194\nHomeServices ........................................................................... 225 191 139\nOther (net) ................................................................................ 73 49 54\nOperating earnings before corporate interest and taxes ...................... 3,438 3,350 3,138\nInterest .................................................................................... 465 499 427\nIncome taxes ............................................................................. 431 481 616\nNet earnings .............................................................................. $ 2,542 $ 2,370 $ 2,095\nEarnings applicable to Berkshire ................................................... $ 2,287 $ 2,132 $ 1,882\nHomeServices may appear out of place in the above table. But it came with our purchase of\nMidAmerican (now BHE) in 1999 – and we are lucky that it did.\nHomeServices owns 38 realty companies with more than 29,000 agents who operate in 28 states. Last\nyear it purchased four realtors, including Houlihan Lawrence, the leader in New York’s Westchester County (in a\ntransaction that closed shortly after yearend).\nIn real estate parlance, representing either a buyer or a seller is called a “side,” with the representation of\nboth counting as two sides. Last year, our owned realtors participated in 244,000 sides, totaling $86 billion in\nvolume.\nHomeServices also franchises many operations throughout the country that use our name. We like both\naspects of the real estate business and expect to acquire many realtors and franchisees during the next decade.\n13\n\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations\nOur manufacturing, service and retailing operations sell products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes.\nLet’s look, though, at a summary balance sheet and earnings statement for the entire group.\nBalance Sheet 12/31/16 (in millions)\nAssets Liabilities and Equity\nCash and equivalents ........................... $ 8,073 Notes payable ................................ $ 2,054\nAccounts and notes receivable .............. 11,183 Other current liabilities .................... 12,464\nInventory .......................................... 15,727 Total current liabilities ..................... 14,518\nOther current assets ............................. 1,039\nTotal current assets ............................. 36,022\nDeferred taxes ................................ 12,044\nGoodwill and other intangibles .............. 71,473 Term debt and other liabilities ........... 10,943\nFixed assets ....................................... 18,915 Non-controlling interests .................. 579\nOther assets ....................................... 3,183 Berkshire equity ............................. 91,509\n$129,593 $129,593\nEarnings Statement (in millions)\n2016 2015 2014\nRevenues ................................................................ $120,059 $107,825 $97,689\nOperating expenses ................................................... 111,383 100,607 90,788\nInterest expense ........................................................ 214 103 109\nPre-tax earnings ....................................................... 8,462 7,115 6,792\nIncome taxes and non-controlling interests .................... 2,831 2,432 2,324\nNet earnings ............................................................ $ 5,631 $ 4,683 $ 4,468\nIncluded in this financial summary are 44 businesses that report directly to headquarters. But some of\nthese companies, in turn, have many individual operations under their umbrella. For example, Marmon has 175\nseparate business units, serving widely disparate markets, and Berkshire Hathaway Automotive owns 83dealerships, operating in nine states.\nThis collection of businesses is truly a motley crew. Some operations, measured by earnings on\nunleveraged net tangible assets, enjoy terrific returns that, in a couple of instances, exceed 100%. Most are solid\nbusinesses generating good returns in the area of 12% to 20%.\n14\n\nA few, however – these are serious blunders I made in my job of capital allocation – produce very poor\nreturns. In most cases, I was wrong when I originally sized up the economic characteristics of these companies or\nthe industries in which they operate, and we are now paying the price for my misjudgments. In a couple ofinstances, I stumbled in assessing either the fidelity or ability of incumbent managers or ones I later put in place.I will commit more errors; you can count on that. Fortunately, Charlie – never bashful – is around to say “no” tomy worst ideas.\nViewed as a single entity, the companies in the manufacturing, service and retailing group are an\nexcellent business. They employed an average of $24 billion of net tangible assets during 2016 and, despite theirholding large quantities of excess cash and carrying very little debt, earned 24% after-tax on that capital.\nOf course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if it is bought at too high a price.\nWe have paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in thelarge figure we show on our balance sheet for goodwill and other intangibles. Overall, however, we are getting adecent return on the capital we have deployed in this sector. Absent a recession, earnings from the group willlikely grow in 2017, in part because Duracell and Precision Castparts (both bought in 2016) will for the first timecontribute a full year’s earnings to this group. Additionally, Duracell incurred significant transitional costs in2016 that will not recur.\nWe have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, their\ncompetitors – both current and potential – read this report. In a few of our businesses, we might be disadvantagedif outsiders knew our numbers. Therefore, in certain of our operations that are not of a size material to anevaluation of Berkshire, we only disclose what is required. You can nevertheless find a good bit of detail aboutmany of our operations on pages 90 - 94. Be aware, though, that it’s the growth of the Berkshire forest thatcounts. It would be foolish to focus over-intently on any single tree.\n************\nFor several years I have told you that the income and expense data shown in this section does not\nconform to GAAP. I have explained that this divergence occurs primarily because of GAAP-ordered rulesregarding purchase-accounting adjustments that require the full amortization of certain intangibles over periodsaveraging about 19 years. In our opinion, most of those amortization “expenses” are not truly an economic cost.Our goal in diverging from GAAP in this section is to present the figures to you in a manner reflecting the way inwhich Charlie and I view and analyze them.\nOn page 54 we itemize $15.4 billion of intangibles that are yet to be amortized by annual charges to\nearnings. (More intangibles to be amortized will be created as we make new acquisitions.) On that page, we showthat the 2016 amortization charge to GAAP earnings was $1.5 billion, up $384 million from 2015. My judgmentis that about 20% of the 2016 charge is a “real” cost.\nEventually amortization charges fully write off the related asset. When that happens – most often at the\n15-year mark – the GAAP earnings we report will increase without any true improvement in the underlyingeconomics of Berkshire’s business. (My gift to my successor.)\nNow that I’ve described a GAAP expense that I believe to be overstated, let me move on to a less\npleasant distortion produced by accounting rules. The subject this time is GAAP-prescribed depreciation charges,which are necessarily based on historical cost. Yet in certain cases, those charges materially understate true\neconomic costs. Countless words were written about this phenomenon in the 1970s and early 1980s, wheninflation was rampant. As inflation subsided – thanks to heroic actions by Paul Volcker – the inadequacy ofdepreciation charges became less of an issue. But the problem still prevails, big time , in the railroad industry,\nwhere current costs for many depreciable items far outstrip historical costs. The inevitable result is that reportedearnings throughout the railroad industry are considerably higher than true economic earnings.\n15\n\nAt BNSF, to get down to particulars, our GAAP depreciation charge last year was $2.1 billion. But were\nwe to spend that sum and no more annually, our railroad would soon deteriorate and become less competitive.\nThe reality is that – simply to hold our own – we need to spend far more than the cost we show for depreciation.\nMoreover, a wide disparity will prevail for decades.\nAll that said, Charlie and I love our railroad, which was one of our better purchases.\n************\nToo many managements – and the number seems to grow every year – are looking for any means to\nreport, and indeed feature , “adjusted earnings” that are higher than their company’s GAAP earnings. There are\nmany ways for practitioners to perform this legerdemain. Two of their favorites are the omission of“restructuring costs” and “stock-based compensation” as expenses.\nCharlie and I want managements, in their commentary , to describe unusual items – good or bad – that\naffect the GAAP numbers. After all, the reason we look at these numbers of the past is to make estimates of thefuture. But a management that regularly attempts to wave away very real costs by highlighting “adjustedper-share earnings” makes us nervous. That’s because bad behavior is contagious: CEOs who overtly look forways to report high numbers tend to foster a culture in which subordinates strive to be “helpful” as well. Goalslike that can lead, for example, to insurers underestimating their loss reserves, a practice that has destroyed manyindustry participants.\nCharlie and I cringe when we hear analysts talk admiringly about managements who always “make the\nnumbers.” In truth, business is too unpredictable for the numbers always to be met. Inevitably, surprises occur.When they do, a CEO whose focus is centered on Wall Street will be tempted to make up the numbers.\nLet’s get back to the two favorites of “don’t-count-this” managers, starting with “restructuring.”\nBerkshire, I would say, has been restructuring from the first day we took over in 1965. Owning only a northerntextile business then gave us no other choice. And today a fair amount of restructuring occurs every year atBerkshire. That’s because there are always things that need to change in our hundreds of businesses. Last year, asI mentioned earlier, we spent significant sums getting Duracell in shape for the decades ahead.\nWe have never, however, singled out restructuring charges and told you to ignore them in estimating our\nnormal earning power. If there were to be some truly major expenses in a single year, I would, of course, mentionit in my commentary. Indeed, when there is a total rebasing of a business, such as occurred when Kraft and Heinzmerged, it is imperative that for several years the huge one-time costs of rationalizing the combined operations beexplained clearly to owners. That’s precisely what the CEO of Kraft Heinz has done, in a manner approved bythe company’s directors (who include me). But, to tell owners year after year, “Don’t count this,” whenmanagement is simply making business adjustments that are necessary, is misleading. And too many analysts andjournalists fall for this baloney.\nTo say “stock-based compensation” is not an expense is even more cavalier. CEOs who go down that\nroad are, in effect, saying to shareholders, “If you pay me a bundle in options or restricted stock, don’t worryabout its effect on earnings. I’ll ‘adjust’ it away.”\nTo explore this maneuver further, join me for a moment in a visit to a make-believe accounting\nlaboratory whose sole mission is to juice Berkshire’s reported earnings. Imaginative technicians await us, eager\nto show their stuff.\n16\n\nListen carefully while I tell these enablers that stock-based compensation usually comprises at least 20%\nof total compensation for the top three or four executives at most large companies. Pay attention, too, as I explain\nthat Berkshire has several hundred such executives at its subsidiaries and pays them similar amounts, but usesonly cash to do so. I further confess that, lacking imagination, I have counted allof these payments to\nBerkshire’s executives as an expense.\nMy accounting minions suppress a giggle and immediately point out that 20% of what is paid these\nBerkshire managers is tantamount to “cash paid in lieu of stock-based compensation” and is therefore not a“true” expense. So – presto! – Berkshire, too, can have “adjusted” earnings.\nBack to reality: If CEOs want to leave out stock-based compensation in reporting earnings, they should\nbe required to affirm to their owners one of two propositions: why items of value used to pay employees are not a\ncost or why a payroll cost should be excluded when calculating earnings.\nDuring the accounting nonsense that flourished during the 1960s, the story was told of a CEO who, as\nhis company revved up to go public, asked prospective auditors, “What is two plus two?” The answer that wonthe assignment, of course, was, “What number do you have in mind?”\nFinance and Financial Products\nOur three leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture), XTRA (semi-trailers), and\nMarmon (primarily tank cars but also freight cars, intermodal tank containers and cranes). Each is the leader in\nits field.\nWe also include Clayton Homes in this section. This company receives most of its revenue from the sale\nof manufactured homes, but derives the bulk of its earnings from its large mortgage portfolio. Last year, Clayton\nbecame America’s largest home builder, delivering 42,075 units that accounted for 5% of all new Americanhomes. (In fairness, other large builders do far more dollar volume than Clayton because they sell site-built\nhomes that command much higher prices.)\nIn 2015, Clayton branched out, purchasing its first site-builder. Two similar acquisitions followed in\n2016, and more will come. Site-built houses are expected to amount to 3% or so of Clayton’s unit sales in 2017and will likely deliver about 14% of its dollar volume.\nEven so, Clayton’s focus will always be manufactured homes, which account for about 70% of new\nAmerican homes costing less than $150,000. Clayton manufactures close to one-half of the total. That is a far cryfrom Clayton’s position in 2003 when Berkshire purchased the company. It then ranked third in the industry inunits sold and employed 6,731 people. Now, when its new acquisitions are included, the employee count is14,677. And that number will increase in the future.\nClayton’s earnings in recent years have materially benefited from extraordinarily low interest rates. The\ncompany’s mortgage loans to home-buyers are at fixed-rates and for long terms (averaging 25 years atinception). But Clayton’s own borrowings are short-term credits that re-price frequently. When rates plunge,Clayton’s earnings from its portfolio greatly increase. We normally would shun that kind of lend-long, borrow-short approach, which can cause major problems for financial institutions. As a whole, however, Berkshire isalways asset-sensitive, meaning that higher short-term rates will benefit our consolidated earnings, even as they\nhurt at Clayton.\n17\n\nLast year Clayton had to foreclose on 8,304 manufactured-housing mortgages, about 2.5% of its total\nportfolio. Customer demographics help explain that percentage. Clayton’s customers are usually lower-income\nfamilies with mediocre credit scores; many are supported by jobs that will be at risk in any recession; many,similarly, have financial profiles that will be damaged by divorce or death to an extent that would not be typicalfor a high-income family. Those risks that our customers face are partly mitigated because almost all have astrong desire to own a home and because they enjoy reasonable monthly payments that average only $587,including the cost of insurance and property taxes.\nClayton also has long had programs that help borrowers through difficulties. The two most popular are\nloan extensions and payment forgiveness. Last year about 11,000 borrowers received extensions, and 3,800 had$3.4 million of scheduled payments permanently canceled by Clayton. The company does not earn interest orfees when these loss-mitigation moves are made. Our experience is that 93% of borrowers helped through theseprograms in the last two years now remain in their homes. Since we lose significant sums onforeclosures – losses last year totaled $150 million – our assistance programs end up helping Clayton as well asits borrowers.\nClayton and Berkshire have been a wonderful partnership. Kevin Clayton came to us with a best-in-class\nmanagement group and culture. Berkshire, in turn, provided unmatched staying power when the manufactured-home industry fell apart during the Great Recession. (As other lenders to the industry vanished, Clayton suppliedcredit not only to its own dealers but also to dealers who sold the products of its competitors.) At Berkshire, wenever count on synergies when we acquire companies. Truly important ones, however, surfaced after ourpurchase of Clayton.\nMarmon’s railcar business experienced a major slowdown in demand last year, which will cause\nearnings to decline in 2017. Fleet utilization was 91% in December, down from 97% a year earlier, with the dropparticularly severe at the large fleet we purchased from General Electric in 2015. Marmon’s crane and containerrentals have weakened as well.\nBig swings in railcar demand have occurred in the past and they will continue. Nevertheless, we very\nmuch like this business and expect decent returns on equity capital over the years. Tank cars are Marmon’sspecialty. People often associate tank cars with the transportation of crude oil; in fact, they are essential to a greatvariety of shippers.\nOver time, we expect to expand our railcar operation. Meanwhile, Marmon is making a number of\nbolt-on acquisitions whose results are included in the Manufacturing, Service and Retailing section.\nHere’s the pre-tax earnings recap for our finance-related companies:\n2016\n2015 2014\n(in millions)\nBerkadia (our 50% share) ............................................ $ 91 $ 74 $ 122\nClayton .................................................................... 744 706 558\nCORT ...................................................................... 60 55 49\nMarmon – Containers and Cranes ................................. 126 192 238\nMarmon – Railcars ..................................................... 654 546 442\nXTRA ..................................................................... 179 172 147\nNet financial income* ................................................. 276 341 283\n$ 2,130 $ 2,086 $ 1,839\n* Excludes capital gains or losses\n18\n\nInvestments\nBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value.

Each, independently , manages more than $10 billion; I usually\nlearn about decisions they have made by looking at monthly trade sheets. Included in the $21 billion that the two\nmanage is about $7.6 billion of pension trust assets of certain Berkshire subsidiaries. As noted, pensioninvestments are not included in the preceding tabulation of Berkshire holdings.\n************\nExcluded from the table – but important – is our ownership of $5 billion of preferred stock issued by\nBank of America. This stock, which pays us $300 million per year, also carries with it a valuable warrantallowing Berkshire to purchase 700 million common shares of Bank of America for $5 billion at any time beforeSeptember 2, 2021. At yearend, that privilege would have delivered us a profit of $10.5 billion. If it wishes,Berkshire can use its preferred shares to satisfy the $5 billion cost of exercising the warrant.\n19\n\nIf the dividend rate on Bank of America common stock – now 30 cents annually – should rise above\n44 cents before 2021, we would anticipate making a cashless exchange of our preferred into common. If the\ncommon dividend remains below 44 cents, it is highly probable that we will exercise the warrant immediatelybefore it expires.\nMany of our investees, including Bank of America, have been repurchasing shares, some quite\naggressively. We very much like this behavior because we believe the repurchased shares have in most casesbeen underpriced. (Undervaluation, after all, is why we own these positions.) When a company grows andoutstanding shares shrink, good things happen for shareholders.\n************\nIt’s important for you to understand that 95% of the $86 billion of “cash and equivalents” (which in my\nmind includes U.S. Treasury Bills) shown on our balance sheet are held by entities in the United States and,consequently, is not subject to any repatriation tax. Moreover, repatriation of the remaining funds would triggeronly minor taxes because much of that money has been earned in countries that themselves impose meaningfulcorporate taxes. Those payments become an offset to U.S. tax when money is brought home.\nThese explanations are important because many cash-rich American companies hold a large portion of\ntheir funds in jurisdictions imposing very low taxes. Such companies hope – and may well be proved right – thatthe tax levied for bringing these funds to America will soon be materially reduced. In the meantime, thesecompanies are limited as to how they can use that cash. In other words, off-shore cash is simply not worth asmuch as cash held at home.\nBerkshire has a partial offset to the favorable geographical location of its cash, which is that much of it\nis held in our insurance subsidiaries. Though we have many alternatives for investing this cash, we do not havethe unlimited choices that we would enjoy if the cash were held by the parent company, Berkshire. We dohave\nan ability annually to distribute large amounts of cash from our insurers to the parent – though here, too, there arelimits. Overall, cash held at our insurers is a very valuable asset, but one slightly less valuable to us than is cashheld at the parent level.\n************\nSometimes the comments of shareholders or media imply that we will own certain stocks “forever.” It is\ntrue that we own some stocks that I have no intention of selling for as far as the eye can see (and we’re talking20/20 vision). But we have made no commitment that Berkshire will hold anyof its marketable securities forever.\nConfusion about this point may have resulted from a too-casual reading of Economic Principle 11 on\npages 110 - 111, which has been included in our annual reports since 1983. That principle covers controlled\nbusinesses , not marketable securities. This year I’ve added a final sentence to #11 to ensure that our owners\nunderstand that we regard any marketable security as available for sale, however unlikely such a sale now seems.\n************\nBefore we leave this investment section, a few educational words about dividends and taxes: Berkshire,\nlike most corporations, nets considerably more from a dollar of dividends than it reaps from a dollar of capital\ngains. That will probably surprise those of our shareholders who are accustomed to thinking of capital gains asthe route to tax-favored returns.\nBut here’s the corporate math. Every $1 of capital gains that a corporation realizes carries with it\n35 cents of federal income tax (and often state income tax as well). The tax on dividends received from domestic\ncorporations, however, is consistently lower, though rates vary depending on the status of the recipient.\n20\n\nFor a non-insurance company – which describes Berkshire Hathaway, the parent – the federal tax rate is\neffectively 101⁄2cents per $1 of dividends received. Furthermore, a non-insurance company that owns more than\n20% of an investee owes taxes of only 7 cents per $1 of dividends. That rate applies, for example, to the\nsubstantial dividends we receive from our 27% ownership of Kraft Heinz, all of it held by the parent company.(The rationale for the low corporate taxes on dividends is that the dividend-paying investee has already paid itsown corporate tax on the earnings being distributed.)\nBerkshire’s insurance subsidiaries pay a tax rate on dividends that is somewhat higher than that applying\nto non-insurance companies, though the rate is still well below the 35% hitting capital gains. Property/casualtycompanies owe about 14% in taxes on most dividends they receive. Their tax rate falls, though, to about 11% ifthey own more than 20% of a U.S.-based investee.\nAnd that’s our tax lesson for today.\n“The Bet” (or how your money finds its way to Wall Street)\nIn this section, you will encounter, early on, the story of an investment bet I made nine years ago and,\nnext, some strong opinions I have about investing. As a starter, though, I want to briefly describe Long Bets, aunique establishment that played a role in the bet.\nLong Bets was seeded by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and operates as a non-profit organization that\nadministers just what you’d guess: long-term bets. To participate, “proposers” post a proposition at Longbets.orgthat will be proved right or wrong at a distant date. They then wait for a contrary-minded party to take the otherside of the bet. When a “doubter” steps forward, each side names a charity that will be the beneficiary if its sidewins; parks its wager with Long Bets; and posts a short essay defending its position on the Long Bets website.When the bet is concluded, Long Bets pays off the winning charity.\nHere are examples of what you will find on Long Bets’ very interesting site:\nIn 2002, entrepreneur Mitch Kapor asserted that “By 2029 no computer – or ‘machine intelligence’ – will\nhave passed the Turing Test,” which deals with whether a computer can successfully impersonate a human being.\nInventor Ray Kurzweil took the opposing view. Each backed up his opinion with $10,000. I don’t know who willwin this bet, but I will confidently wager that no computer will ever replicate Charlie.\nThat same year, Craig Mundie of Microsoft asserted that pilotless planes would routinely fly passengers\nby 2030, while Eric Schmidt of Google argued otherwise. The stakes were $1,000 each. To ease any heartburnEric might be experiencing from his outsized exposure, I recently offered to take a piece of his action. Hepromptly laid off $500 with me. (I like his assumption that I’ll be around in 2030 to contribute my payment,should we lose.)\nNow, to my bet and its history. In Berkshire’s 2005 annual report, I argued that active investment\nmanagement by professionals – in aggregate – would over a period of years underperform the returns achieved byrank amateurs who simply sat still. I explained that the massive fees levied by a variety of “helpers” would leavetheir clients – again in aggregate – worse off than if the amateurs simply invested in an unmanaged low-cost index\nfund. (See pages 114 - 115 for a reprint of the argument as I originally stated it in the 2005 report.)\n21\n\nSubsequently, I publicly offered to wager $500,000 that no investment pro could select a set of at least\nfive hedge funds – wildly-popular and high-fee investing vehicles – that would over an extended period match\nthe performance of an unmanaged S&P-500 index fund charging only token fees. I suggested a ten-year bet andnamed a low-cost Vanguard S&P fund as my contender. I then sat back and waited expectantly for a parade offund managers – who could include their own fund as one of the five – to come forth and defend theiroccupation. After all, these managers urged others to bet billions on their abilities. Why should they fear putting\na little of their own money on the line?\nWhat followed was the sound of silence. Though there are thousands of professional investment managers\nwho have amassed staggering fortunes by touting their stock-selecting prowess, only one man – Ted Seides –stepped up to my challenge. Ted was a co-manager of Protégé Partners, an asset manager that had raised moneyfrom limited partners to form a fund-of-funds – in other words, a fund that invests in multiple hedge funds.\nI hadn’t known Ted before our wager, but I like him and admire his willingness to put his money where\nhis mouth was. He has been both straight-forward with me and meticulous in supplying all the data that both heand I have needed to monitor the bet.\nFor Protégé Partners’ side of our ten-year bet, Ted picked five funds-of-funds whose results were to be\naveraged and compared against my Vanguard S&P index fund. The five he selected had invested their money inmore than 100 hedge funds, which meant that the overall performance of the funds-of-funds would not bedistorted by the good or poor results of a single manager.\nEach fund-of-funds, of course, operated with a layer of fees that sat above the fees charged by the hedge\nfunds in which it had invested. In this doubling-up arrangement, the larger fees were levied by the underlyinghedge funds; each of the fund-of-funds imposed an additional fee for its presumed skills in selecting hedge-fundmanagers.\nHere are the results for the first nine years of the bet – figures leaving no doubt that Girls Inc. of Omaha,\nthe charitable beneficiary I designated to get any bet winnings I earned, will be the organization eagerly openingthe mail next January.\nYear\nFund of\nFunds AFund of\nFunds BFund of\nFunds CFund of\nFunds DFund of\nFunds ES&PIndex Fund\n2008 -16.5% -22.3% -21.3% -29.3% -30.1% -37.0%2009 11.3% 14.5% 21.4% 16.5% 16.8% 26.6%2010 5.9% 6.8% 13.3% 4.9% 11.9% 15.1%2011 -6.3% -1.3% 5.9% -6.3% -2.8% 2.1%2012 3.4% 9.6% 5.7% 6.2% 9.1% 16.0%2013 10.5% 15.2% 8.8% 14.2% 14.4% 32.3%2014 4.7% 4.0% 18.9% 0.7% -2.1% 13.6%2015 1.6% 2.5% 5.4% 1.4% -5.0% 1.4%2016 -2.9% 1.7% -1.4% 2.5% 4.4% 11.9%Gain toDate 8.7% 28.3% 62.8% 2.9% 7.5% 85.4%\nFootnote: Under my agreement with Protégé Partners, the names of these funds-of-funds have never\nbeen publicly disclosed.

That’s an important fact: A particularly weak nine years for themarket over the lifetime of this bet would have probably helped the relative performance of the hedge funds,because many hold large “short” positions. Conversely, nine years of exceptionally high returns from stockswould have provided a tailwind for index funds.\nInstead we operated in what I would call a “neutral” environment. In it, the five funds-of-funds\ndelivered, through 2016, an average of only 2.2%, compounded annually. That means $1 million invested inthose funds would have gained $220,000. The index fund would meanwhile have gained $854,000.\n22\n\nBear in mind that every one of the 100-plus managers of the underlying hedge funds had a huge\nfinancial incentive to do his or her best. Moreover, the five funds-of-funds managers that Ted selected were\nsimilarly incentivized to select the best hedge-fund managers possible because the five were entitled toperformance fees based on the results of the underlying funds.\nI’m certain that in almost all cases the managers at both levels were honest and intelligent people. But\nthe results for their investors were dismal – really dismal. And, alas, the huge fixed fees charged by all of the\nfunds and funds-of-funds involved – fees that were totally unwarranted by performance – were such that theirmanagers were showered with compensation over the nine years that have passed. As Gordon Gekko might haveput it: “Fees never sleep.”\nThe underlying hedge-fund managers in our bet received payments from their limited partners that\nlikely averaged a bit under the prevailing hedge-fund standard of “2 and 20,” meaning a 2% annual fixed fee,payable even when losses are huge, and 20% of profits with no clawback (if good years were followed by badones). Under this lopsided arrangement, a hedge fund operator’s ability to simply pile up assets undermanagement has made many of these managers extraordinarily rich, even as their investments have performedpoorly.\nStill, we’re not through with fees. Remember, there were the fund-of-funds managers to be fed as well.\nThese managers received an additional fixed amount that was usually set at 1% of assets. Then, despite theterrible overall record of the five funds-of-funds, some experienced a few good years and collected“performance” fees. Consequently, I estimate that over the nine-year period roughly 60% – gulp! – of allgains\nachieved by the five funds-of-funds were diverted to the two levels of managers. That was their misbegottenreward for accomplishing something far short of what their many hundreds of limited partners could haveeffortlessly – and with virtually nocost – achieved on their own.\nIn my opinion, the disappointing results for hedge-fund investors that this bet exposed are almost certain\nto recur in the future. I laid out my reasons for that belief in a statement that was posted on the Long Bets websitewhen the bet commenced (and that is still posted there). Here is what I asserted:\nOver a ten-year period commencing on January 1, 2008, and ending on December 31, 2017,the S&P 500 will outperform a portfolio of funds of hedge funds, when performance ismeasured on a basis net of fees, costs and expenses.\nA lot of very smart people set out to do better than average in securities markets. Call them\nactive investors.\nTheir opposites, passive investors, will by definition do about average. In aggregate their\npositions will more or less approximate those of an index fund. Therefore, the balance ofthe universe—the active investors—must do about average as well. However, theseinvestors will incur far greater costs. So, on balance, their aggregate results after these costswill be worse than those of the passive investors.\nCosts skyrocket when large annual fees, large performance fees, and active trading costs are\nall added to the active investor’s equation. Funds of hedge funds accentuate this costproblem because their fees are superimposed on the large fees charged by the hedge fundsin which the funds of funds are invested.\nA number of smart people are involved in running hedge funds. But to a great extent their\nefforts are self-neutralizing, and their IQ will not overcome the costs they impose oninvestors. Investors, on average and over time, will do better with a low-cost index fundthan with a group of funds of funds.\n23\n\nSo that was my argument – and now let me put it into a simple equation. If Group A (active investors)\nand Group B (do-nothing investors) comprise the total investing universe, and B is destined to achieve average\nresults before costs, so, too, must A. Whichever group has the lower costs will win. (The academic in me requiresme to mention that there is a very minor point – not worth detailing – that slightly modifies this formulation.)\nAnd if Group A has exorbitant costs, its shortfall will be substantial.\nThere are, of course, some skilled individuals who are highly likely to out-perform the S&P over long\nstretches. In my lifetime, though, I’ve identified – early on – only ten or so professionals that I expected would\naccomplish this feat.\nThere are no doubt many hundreds of people – perhaps thousands – whom I have never met and whose\nabilities would equal those of the people I’ve identified. The job, after all, is not impossible. The problem simplyis that the great majority of managers who attempt to over-perform will fail. The probability is also very high thatthe person soliciting your funds will not be the exception who does well. Bill Ruane – a truly wonderful humanbeing and a man whom I identified 60 years ago as almost certain to deliver superior investment returns over thelong haul – said it well: “In investment management, the progression is from the innovators to the imitators to theswarming incompetents.”\nFurther complicating the search for the rare high-fee manager who is worth his or her pay is the fact that\nsome investment professionals, just as some amateurs, will be lucky over short periods. If 1,000 managers makea market prediction at the beginning of a year, it’s very likely that the calls of at least one will be correct for nineconsecutive years. Of course, 1,000 monkeys would be just as likely to produce a seemingly all-wise prophet.But there would remain a difference: The lucky monkey would not find people standing in line to invest with\nhim.\nFinally, there are three connected realities that cause investing success to breed failure. First, a good\nrecord quickly attracts a torrent of money. Second, huge sums invariably act as an anchor on investmentperformance: What is easy with millions, struggles with billions (sob!). Third, most managers will neverthelessseek new money because of their personal equation – namely, the more funds they have under management, the\nmore their fees.\nThese three points are hardly new ground for me: In January 1966, when I was managing $44 million ,I\nwrote my limited partners: “I feel substantially greater size is more likely to harm future results than to helpthem. This might not be true for my own personal results, but it is likely to be true for your results. Therefore, . . .I intend to admit no additional partners to BPL. I have notified Susie that if we have any more children, it is up toher to find some other partnership for them.”\nThe bottom line: When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will\nusually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients. Both large and small investors should stickwith low-cost index funds.\n************\nIf a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands-\ndown choice should be Jack Bogle. For decades, Jack has urged investors to invest in ultra-low-cost index funds.In his crusade, he amassed only a tiny percentage of the wealth that has typically flowed to managers who havepromised their investors large rewards while delivering them nothing – or, as in our bet, lessthan nothing – of\nadded value.\nIn his early years, Jack was frequently mocked by the investment-management industry. Today,\nhowever, he has the satisfaction of knowing that he helped millions of investors realize far better returns on theirsavings than they otherwise would have earned. He is a hero to them and to me.\n************\nOver the years, I’ve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I’ve\nlearned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&P 500 indexfund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.\n24\n\nI believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed\nthat same advice when I’ve given it to them. Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and\ndepart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out anotherbreed of hyper-helper called a consultant.\nThat professional, however, faces a problem. Can you imagine an investment consultant telling clients,\nyear after year, to keep adding to an index fund replicating the S&P 500? That would be career suicide. Largefees flow to these hyper-helpers, however, if they recommend small managerial shifts every year or so. Thatadvice is often delivered in esoteric gibberish that explains why fashionable investment “styles” or currenteconomic trends make the shift appropriate.\nThe wealthy are accustomed to feeling that it is their lot in life to get the best food, schooling,\nentertainment, housing, plastic surgery, sports ticket, you name it. Their money, they feel, should buy themsomething superior compared to what the masses receive.\nIn many aspects of life, indeed, wealth does command top-grade products or services. For that reason,\nthe financial “elites” – wealthy individuals, pension funds, college endowments and the like – have great troublemeekly signing up for a financial product or service that is available as well to people investing only a fewthousand dollars. This reluctance of the rich normally prevails even though the product at issue is –on anexpectancy basis – clearly the best choice. My calculation, admittedly very rough, is that the search by the elitefor superior investment advice has caused it, in aggregate, to waste more than $100 billion over the past decade.Figure it out: Even a 1% fee on a few trillion dollars adds up. Of course, not every investor who put money inhedge funds ten years ago lagged S&P returns. But I believe my calculation of the aggregate shortfall isconservative.\nMuch of the financial damage befell pension funds for public employees. Many of these funds are\nwoefully underfunded, in part because they have suffered a double whammy: poor investment performanceaccompanied by huge fees. The resulting shortfalls in their assets will for decades have to be made up by localtaxpayers.\nHuman behavior won’t change. Wealthy individuals, pension funds, endowments and the like will\ncontinue to feel they deserve something “extra” in investment advice. Those advisors who cleverly play to thisexpectation will get very rich. This year the magic potion may be hedge funds, next year something else. Thelikely result from this parade of promises is predicted in an adage: “When a person with money meets a personwith experience, the one with experience ends up with the money and the one with money leaves withexperience.”\nLong ago, a brother-in-law of mine, Homer Rogers, was a commission agent working in the Omaha\nstockyards. I asked him how he induced a farmer or rancher to hire him to handle the sale of their hogs or cattleto the buyers from the big four packers (Swift, Cudahy, Wilson and Armour). After all, hogs were hogs and thebuyers were experts who knew to the penny how much any animal was worth. How then, I asked Homer, couldany sales agent get a better result than any other?\nHomer gave me a pitying look and said: “Warren, it’s not how you sell ‘em, it’s how you tell ‘em.”\nWhat worked in the stockyards continues to work in Wall Street.\n************\nAnd, finally, let me offer an olive branch to Wall Streeters, many of them good friends of mine.\nBerkshire loves to pay fees – even outrageous fees – to investment bankers who bring us acquisitions. Moreover,\nwe have paid substantial sums for over-performance to our two in-house investment managers – and we hope tomake even larger payments to them in the future.\nTo get biblical (Ephesians 3:18), I know the height and the depth and the length and the breadth of the\nenergy flowing from that simple four-letter word – fees – when it is spoken to Wall Street. And when that energydelivers value to Berkshire, I will cheerfully write a big check.\n25\n\nThe Annual Meeting\nLast year we partnered with Yahoo to air the first-ever webcast of our annual meeting. Thanks to Andy\nSerwer and his Yahoo crew, the production was a success in all respects, registering 1.1 million unique visits in\nreal-time viewing and 11.5 million more in replays (many of those, to be sure, called up by viewers interested inonly certain segments of the webcast).\nBerkshire’s thank-you mail for initiating the webcast included many notes from three constituencies: the\nelderly who find travel difficult; the thrifty who find it expensive to travel to Omaha; and those who cannotattend a Saturday meeting for religious reasons.\nThe webcast cut attendance at last year’s meeting to about 37,000 people (we can’t get a precise count),\nwhich was down about 10%. Nevertheless, both Berkshire’s subsidiaries and Omaha hotels and restaurantsracked up huge sales. Nebraska Furniture Mart’s sales broke their 2015 record volume by 3%, with the Omahastore recording one-week volume of $45.5 million.\nOur Berkshire exhibitors at CenturyLink were open from noon until 5 p.m. on Friday and drew a crowd\nof 12,000 bargain-hunting shareholders. We will repeat those Friday shopping hours this year on May 5\nth. Bring\nmoney.\nThe annual meeting falls on May 6thand will again be webcast by Yahoo, whose web address is\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/brklivestream. The webcast will go live at 9 a.m. Central Daylight Time. Yahoo willinterview directors, managers, stockholders and celebrities before the meeting and during the lunch break. Boththose interviews and meeting will be translated simultaneously into Mandarin.\nFor those attending the meeting in person, the doors at the CenturyLink will open at 7:00 a.m. on\nSaturday to facilitate shopping prior to our shareholder movie, which begins at 8:30. The question-and-answerperiod will start at 9:30 and run until 3:30, with a one-hour lunch break at noon. Finally, at 3:45 we will begin theformal shareholder meeting. It will run an hour or so. That is somewhat longer than usual because three proxyitems are to be presented by their proponents, who will be given a reasonable amount of time to state their case.\nOn Saturday morning, we will have our sixth International Newspaper Tossing Challenge. Our target\nwill again be the porch of a Clayton Home, located precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. When I was ateenager – in my one brief flirtation with honest labor – I delivered about 500,000 papers. So I think I’m prettygood at this game. Challenge me! Humiliate me! Knock me down a peg! The papers will run 36 to 42 pages, andyou must fold them yourself (no rubber bands allowed). The competition will begin about 7:45, and I’ll take onten or so competitors selected a few minutes earlier by my assistant, Deb Bosanek.\nYour venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in which\nproducts from dozens of our subsidiaries will be for sale. Say hello to the many Berkshire managers who will becaptaining their exhibits. And be sure to view the terrific BNSF railroad layout that salutes all of our companies.Your children (and you!) will be enchanted with it.\nBrooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at the\nmeeting. After you purchase a pair, wear them on Sunday at our fourth annual “Berkshire 5K,” an 8 a.m. racestarting at the CenturyLink. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor’s Guide that will be sentto you with your meeting credentials. Entrants in the race will find themselves running alongside many ofBerkshire’s managers, directors and associates. (Charlie and I, however, will sleep in; the fudge and peanutbrittle we eat throughout the Saturday meeting takes its toll.) Participation in the 5K grows every year. Help usset another record.\n26\n\nA GEICO booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company’s top counselors from\naround the country. At last year’s meeting, we set a record for policy sales, up 21% from 2015. I predict we will\nbe up again this year.\nSo stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount (usually\n8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental point:The discount is not additive if you qualify for another discount, such as that available to certain groups.) Bringthe details of your existing insurance and check out our price. We can save many of you real money. Spend thesavings on other Berkshire products.\nBe sure to visit the Bookworm. This Omaha-based retailer will carry about 35 books and DVDs, among\nthem a couple of new titles. The best book I read last year was Shoe Dog , by Nike’s Phil Knight. Phil is a very\nwise, intelligent and competitive fellow who is also a gifted storyteller. The Bookworm will have piles of Shoe\nDogas well as several investment classics by Jack Bogle.\nThe Bookworm will once again offer our history of the highlights (and lowlights) of Berkshire’s first 50\nyears. Non-attendees of the meeting can find the book on eBay. Just type in: Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\nCelebrating 50 years of a Profitable Partnership (2\nndEdition).\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to both the meeting and other events. Keep in mind that airlines havesometimes jacked up prices for the Berkshire weekend – though I must admit I have developed some tolerance,bordering on enthusiasm, for that practice now that Berkshire has made large investments in America’s fourmajor carriers. Nevertheless, if you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City vs.Omaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2\n1/2hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you\nsignificant money. The savings for a couple could run to $1,000 or more. Spend that money with us.\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72ndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we will\nagain be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. To obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you mustmake your purchases between Tuesday, May 2\nndand Monday, May 8thinclusive, and must also present your\nmeeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigiousmanufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholderweekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. During “Berkshire Weekend,” NFMwill be open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. on Saturday and 10 a.m. to 8p.m. on Sunday. From 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday, NFM is hosting a picnic to which you are all invited.\nThis year we have good news for shareholders in the Kansas City and Dallas metro markets who can’t\nattend the meeting or perhaps prefer the webcast. From May 2\nndthrough May 8th, shareholders who present\nmeeting credentials or other evidence of their Berkshire ownership (such as brokerage statements) to their localNFM store will receive the same discounts enjoyed by those visiting the Omaha store.\nAt Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception\nfrom 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 5\nth. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 7th, from 9\na.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will remain open until 6 p.m. Remember, the more you buy, the more you save(or so my daughter tells me when we visit the store).\n27\n\nWe will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, May 1stthrough Saturday, May 13th. During that period,\nplease identify yourself as a shareholder either by presenting your meeting credential or a brokerage statement\nshowing you own our stock.\nOn Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, Norman Beck, a remarkable magician and motivational\nspeaker from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. On the upper level, we will have Bob Hamman and SharonOsberg, two of the world’s top bridge experts, available to play with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. Ifthey suggest wagering on the game, change the subject. I will join them at some point and hope Ajit, Charlie andBill Gates will do so also.\nMy friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. I\nmet Ariel when she was nine, and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Ariel represented theUnited States in the 2012 Olympics. Now, she’s a senior at Princeton (after interning last summer at JPMorganChase). If you don’t mind embarrassing yourself, test your skills against her, beginning at 1 p.m. Bill Gates didpretty well playing Ariel last year, so he may be ready to again challenge her. (My advice: Bet on Ariel.)\nGorat’s will be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 7\nth, serving from 1 p.m.\nuntil 10 p.m. To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call 402-551-3733 on April 3rd(but not before ). Show you are a\nsophisticated diner by ordering the T-bone with hash browns.\nWe will have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the meeting,\nasking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and theire-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, the preeminent business journalist of her time, who may be e-mailed atloomisbrk@gmail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, ofthe New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.\nFrom the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most\ninteresting and important to shareholders. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of beingselected if you keep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include nomore than two questions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would likeyour name mentioned if your question is asked.)\nAn accompanying set of questions will be asked by three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the\ninsurance specialist will be Jay Gelb of Barclays. Questions that deal with our non-insurance operations willcome from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Since what wewill be conducting is a shareholders’ meeting, our hope is that the analysts and journalists will ask questions that\nadd to our owners’ understanding and knowledge of their investment.\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be\ntough, for sure, and that’s the way we like it. Multi-part questions aren’t allowed; we want to give as manyquestioners as possible a shot at us. Our goal is for you to leave the meeting knowing more about Berkshire thanwhen you came and for you to have a good time while in Omaha.\nAll told, we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and\nfor 18 from the audience. The questioners from the audience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that willtake place at 8:15 a.m. on the morning of the annual meeting. Each of the 11 microphones installed in the arenaand main overflow room will host, so to speak, a drawing.\n28\n\nWhile I’m on the subject of our owners’ gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I\nbelieve all shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and, if\npossible, should also have adequate time to digest and analyze it before any trading takes place. That’s why wetry to issue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on aSaturday (a day that also eases traffic and parking problems).\nWe do not follow the common practice of talking one-on-one with large institutional investors or\nanalysts, treating them instead as we do all other shareholders. There is no one more important to us than theshareholder of limited means who trusts us with a substantial portion of his or her savings. As I run the companyday-to-day – and as I write this letter – that is the shareholder whose image is in my mind.\n************\nFor good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly\nAll-Stars who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I also believe themindset of our managers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-ownedcompanies. Most of our managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business “home runs” meansas much to them as their paycheck.\nEqually important, however, are the men and women who work with me at our corporate office. This\nteam efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 30,450-page Federalincome tax return, oversees the filing of 3,580 state tax returns, responds to countless shareholder and mediainquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country’s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board’sactivities, fact-checks this letter – and the list goes on and on.\nThey handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy\nand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year, for example, they dealtwith the 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me.They also handle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and Frenchfries (smothered in Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. In addition, they cheerfully pitch in to help Carrie Sova –our talented ringmaster at the annual meeting – deliver an interesting and entertaining weekend for ourshareholders. They are proud to work for Berkshire, and I am proud of them.\nI’m a lucky guy, very fortunate in being surrounded by this excellent staff, a team of highly-talented\noperating managers and a boardroom of very wise and experienced directors. Come to Omaha – the cradle ofcapitalism – on May 6\nthand meet the Berkshire Bunch. All of us look forward to seeing you.\nFebruary 25, 2017 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board\n29",

Starting in 1979, accounting\nrules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previouslythe requirement. In this table, Berkshire’s results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the result s are\ncalculated using the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax . If a corporation\nsuch as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500 in yearswhen that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return. Over the years,the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n2\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshire’s gain in net worth during 2017 was $65.3 billion, which increased the per-share book value of\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 23%. Over the last 53 years (that is, since present management took over), per-share book value has grown from $19 to $211,750, a rate of 19.1% compounded annually.*\nThe format of that opening paragraph has been standard for 30 years. But 2017 was far from standard: A\nlarge portion of our gain did notcome from anything we accomplished at Berkshire.\nThe $65 billion gain is nonetheless real – rest assured of that. But only $36 billion came from Berkshire’s\noperations. The remaining $29 billion was delivered to us in December when Congress rewrote the U.S. Tax Code.(Details of Berkshire’s tax-related gain appear on page K-32 and pages K-89 – K-90.)\nAfter stating those fiscal facts, I would prefer to turn immediately to discussing Berkshire’s operations. But,\nin still another interruption, I must first tell you about a new accounting rule – a generally accepted accountingprinciple (GAAP) – that in future quarterly and annual reports will severely distort Berkshire’s net income figures and\nvery often mislead commentators and investors.\nThe new rule says that the net change in unrealized investment gains and losses in stocks we hold must be\nincluded in all net income figures we report to you. That requirement will produce some truly wild and capriciousswings in our GAAP bottom-line. Berkshire owns $170 billion of marketable stocks (not including our shares of KraftHeinz), and the value of these holdings can easily swing by $10 billion or more within a quarterly reporting period.Including gyrations of that magnitude in reported net income will swamp the truly important numbers that describe ouroperating performance. For analytical purposes, Berkshire’s “bottom-line” will be useless.\nThe new rule compounds the communication problems we have long had in dealing with the realized gains\n(or losses) that accounting rules compel us to include in our net income. In past quarterly and annual press releases,we have regularly warned you not to pay attention to these realized gains, because they – just like our unrealized gains– fluctuate randomly.\nThat’s largely because we sell securities when that seems the intelligent thing to do, not because we are trying\nto influence earnings in any way. As a result, we sometimes have reported substantial realized gains for a period whenour portfolio, overall, performed poorly (or the converse).\n*All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500\nthof those\nshown for the A shares.\n3\n\nWith the new rule about unrealized gains exacerbating the distortion caused by the existing rules applying to\nrealized gains, we will take pains every quarter to explain the adjustments you need in order to make sense of ournumbers. But televised commentary on earnings releases is often instantaneous with their receipt, and newspaperheadlines almost always focus on the year-over-year change in GAAP net income. Consequently, media reportssometimes highlight figures that unnecessarily frighten or encourage many readers or viewers.\nWe will attempt to alleviate this problem by continuing our practice of publishing financial reports late on\nFriday, well after the markets close, or early on Saturday morning. That will allow you maximum time for analysisand give investment professionals the opportunity to deliver informed commentary before markets open on Monday.Nevertheless, I expect considerable confusion among shareholders for whom accounting is a foreign language.\nAt Berkshire what counts most are increases in our normalized per-share earning power. That metric is what\nCharlie Munger, my long-time partner, and I focus on – and we hope that you do, too. Our scorecard for 2017 follows.\nAcquisitions\nThere are four building blocks that add value to Berkshire: (1) sizable stand-alone acquisitions; (2) bolt-on\nacquisitions that fit with businesses we already own; (3) internal sales growth and margin improvement at our manyand varied businesses; and (4) investment earnings from our huge portfolio of stocks and bonds. In this section, wewill review 2017 acquisition activity.\nIn our search for new stand-alone businesses, the key qualities we seek are durable competitive strengths;\nable and high-grade management; good returns on the net tangible assets required to operate the business;opportunities for internal growth at attractive returns; and, finally, a sensible purchase price .\nThat last requirement proved a barrier to virtually all deals we reviewed in 2017, as prices for decent, but far\nfrom spectacular, businesses hit an all-time high. Indeed, price seemed almost irrelevant to an army of optimisticpurchasers.\nWhy the purchasing frenzy? In part, it’s because the CEO job self-selects for “can-do” types. If Wall Street\nanalysts or board members urge that brand of CEO to consider possible acquisitions, it’s a bit like telling your ripeningteenager to be sure to have a normal sex life.\nOnce a CEO hungers for a deal, he or she will never lack for forecasts that justify the purchase. Subordinates\nwill be cheering, envisioning enlarged domains and the compensation levels that typically increase with corporatesize. Investment bankers, smelling huge fees, will be applauding as well. (Don’t ask the barber whether you need ahaircut.) If the historical performance of the target falls short of validating its acquisition, large “synergies” will beforecast. Spreadsheets never disappoint.\nThe ample availability of extraordinarily cheap debt in 2017 further fueled purchase activity. After all, even\na high-priced deal will usually boost per-share earnings if it is debt-financed. At Berkshire, in contrast, we evaluateacquisitions on an all-equity basis, knowing that our taste for overall debt is very low and that to assign a large portionof our debt to any individual business would generally be fallacious (leaving aside certain exceptions, such as debtdedicated to Clayton’s lending portfolio or to the fixed-asset commitments at our regulated utilities). We also neverfactor in, nor do we often find, synergies.\nOur aversion to leverage has dampened our returns over the years. But Charlie and I sleep well. Both of us\nbelieve it is insane to risk what you have and need in order to obtain what you don’t need. We held this view 50 yearsago when we each ran an investment partnership, funded by a few friends and relatives who trusted us. We also holdit today after a million or so “partners” have joined us at Berkshire.\n4\n\nDespite our recent drought of acquisitions, Charlie and I believe that from time to time Berkshire will have\nopportunities to make very large purchases. In the meantime, we will stick with our simple guideline: The less theprudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we must conduct our own.\n************\nWe were able to make one sensible stand-alone purchase last year, a 38.6% partnership interest in Pilot Flying\nJ (“PFJ”). With about $20 billion in annual volume, the company is far and away the nation’s leading travel-centeroperator.\nPFJ has been run from the get-go by the remarkable Haslam family. “Big Jim” Haslam began with a dream\nand a gas station 60 years ago. Now his son, Jimmy, manages 27,000 associates at about 750 locations throughoutNorth America. Berkshire has a contractual agreement to increase its partnership interest in PFJ to 80% in 2023;Haslam family members will then own the remaining 20%. Berkshire is delighted to be their partner.\nWhen driving on the Interstate, drop in. PFJ sells gasoline as well as diesel fuel, and the food is good. If it’s\nbeen a long day, remember, too, that our properties have 5,200 showers.\n************\nLet’s move now to bolt-on acquisitions. Some of these were small transactions that I will not detail. Here is\nan account, however, of a few larger purchases whose closings stretched between late 2016 and early 2018.\nŠ Clayton Homes acquired two builders of conventional homes during 2017, a move that more than doubled\nour presence in a field we entered only three years ago. With these additions – Oakwood Homes in Colorado andHarris Doyle in Birmingham – I expect our 2018 site built volume will exceed $1 billion.\nClayton’s emphasis, nonetheless, remains manufactured homes, both their construction and their financing.\nIn 2017 Clayton sold 19,168 units through its own retail operation and wholesaled another 26,706 units to independentretailers. All told, Clayton accounted for 49% of the manufactured-home market last year. That industry-leading share– about three times what our nearest competitor did – is a far cry from the 13% Clayton achieved in 2003, the year itjoined Berkshire.\nBoth Clayton Homes and PFJ are based in Knoxville, where the Clayton and Haslam families have long been\nfriends. Kevin Clayton’s comments to the Haslams about the advantages of a Berkshire affiliation, and his admiringcomments about the Haslam family to me, helped cement the PFJ deal.\nŠ Near the end of 2016, Shaw Industries, our floor coverings business, acquired U.S. Floors (“USF”), a rapidly\ngrowing distributor of luxury vinyl tile. USF’s managers, Piet Dossche and Philippe Erramuzpe, came out of the gatefast, delivering a 40% increase in sales in 2017, during which their operation was integrated with Shaw’s. It’s clearthat we acquired both great human assets andbusiness assets in making the USF purchase.\nVance Bell, Shaw’s CEO, originated, negotiated and completed this acquisition, which increased Shaw’s\nsales to $5.7 billion in 2017 and its employment to 22,000. With the purchase of USF, Shaw has substantiallystrengthened its position as an important and durable source of earnings for Berkshire.\nŠ I have told you several times about HomeServices, our growing real estate brokerage operation. Berkshire\nbacked into this business in 2000 when we acquired a majority interest in MidAmerican Energy (now named BerkshireHathaway Energy). MidAmerican’s activities were then largely in the electric utility field, and I originally paid littleattention to HomeServices.\n5\n\nBut, year-by-year, the company added brokers and, by the end of 2016, HomeServices was the second-largest\nbrokerage operation in the country – still ranking, though, far behind the leader, Realogy. In 2017, however,HomeServices’ growth exploded. We acquired the industry’s third-largest operator, Long and Foster; number 12,Houlihan Lawrence; and Gloria Nilson.\nWith those purchases we added 12,300 agents, raising our total to 40,950. HomeServices is now close to\nleading the country in home sales, having participated (including our three acquisitions pro-forma) in $127 billion of“sides” during 2017. To explain that term, there are two “sides” to every transaction; if we represent both buyer andseller, the dollar value of the transaction is counted twice.\nDespite its recent acquisitions, HomeServices is on track to do only about 3% of the country’s home-\nbrokerage business in 2018. That leaves 97% to go. Given sensible prices, we will keep adding brokers in this mostfundamental of businesses.\nŠ Finally, Precision Castparts, a company built through acquisitions, bought Wilhelm Schulz GmbH, a\nGerman maker of corrosion resistant fittings, piping systems and components. Please allow me to skip a furtherexplanation. I don’t understand manufacturing operations as well as I do the activities of real estate brokers, homebuilders or truck stops.\nFortunately, I don’t need in this instance to bring knowledge to the table: Mark Donegan, CEO of Precision,\nis an extraordinary manufacturing executive, and any business in his domain is slated to do well. Betting on peoplecan sometimes be more certain than betting on physical assets.\nLet’s now move on to operations, beginning with property-casualty (“p/c”) insurance, a business I do\nunderstand and the engine that for 51 years has powered Berkshire’s growth.\nInsurance\nBefore I discuss our 2017 insurance results, let me remind you of how and why we entered the field. We\nbegan by purchasing National Indemnity and a smaller sister company for $8.6 million in early 1967. With ourpurchase we received $6.7 million of tangible net worth that, by the nature of the insurance business, we were able todeploy in marketable securities. It was easy to rearrange the portfolio into securities we would otherwise have owned atBerkshire itself. In effect, we were “trading dollars” for the net worth portion of the cost.\nThe $1.9 million premium over net worth that Berkshire paid brought us an insurance business that usually\ndelivered an underwriting profit. Even more important, the insurance operation carried with it $19.4 million of “float”– money that belonged to others but was held by our two insurers.\nEver since, float has been of great importance to Berkshire. When we invest these funds, all dividends,\ninterest and gains from their deployment belong to Berkshire. (If we experience investment losses, those, of course,are on our tab as well.)\nFloat materializes at p/c insurers in several ways: (1) Premiums are generally paid to the company upfront\nwhereas losses occur over the life of the policy, usually a six-month or one-year period; (2) Though some losses, suchas car repairs, are quickly paid, others – such as the harm caused by exposure to asbestos – may take many years tosurface and even longer to evaluate and settle; (3) Loss payments are sometimes spread over decades in cases, say, ofa person employed by one of our workers’ compensation policyholders being permanently injured and thereafterrequiring expensive lifetime care.\n6\n\nFloat generally grows as premium volume increases. Additionally, certain p/c insurers specialize in lines of\nbusiness such as medical malpractice or product liability – business labeled “long-tail” in industry jargon – thatgenerate far more float than, say, auto collision and homeowner policies, which require insurers to almost immediatelymake payments to claimants for needed repairs.\nBerkshire has been a leader in long-tail business for many years. In particular, we have specialized in jumbo\nreinsurance policies that leave us assuming long-tail losses already incurred by other p/c insurers. As a result of our\nemphasizing that sort of business, Berkshire’s growth in float has been extraordinary. We are now the country’s secondlargest p/c company measured by premium volume and its leader, by far, in float.\nHere’s the record:\n(in $ millions)\nYear\nPremium Volume Float\n1970 $ 39 $ 39\n1980 185 2371990 582 1,6322000 19,343 27,8712010 30,749 65,8322017 60,597 114,500\nOur 2017 volume was boosted by a huge deal in which we reinsured up to $20 billion of long-tail losses that\nAIG had incurred. Our premium for this policy was $10.2 billion, a world’s record and one we won’t come close torepeating. Premium volume will therefore fall somewhat in 2018.\nFloat will probably increase slowly for at least a few years. When we eventually experience a decline, it will\nbe modest – at most 3% or so in any single year. Unlike bank deposits or life insurance policies containing surrenderoptions, p/c float can’t be withdrawn. This means that p/c companies can’t experience massive “runs” in times ofwidespread financial stress, a characteristic of prime importance to Berkshire that we factor into our investmentdecisions.\nCharlie and I never will operate Berkshire in a manner that depends on the kindness of strangers – or even\nthat of friends who may be facing liquidity problems of their own. During the 2008-2009 crisis, we liked havingTreasury Bills – loads of Treasury Bills – that protected us from having to rely on funding sources such as bank lines\nor commercial paper. We have intentionally constructed Berkshire in a manner that will allow it to comfortablywithstand economic discontinuities, including such extremes as extended market closures.\n************\nThe downside of float is that it comes with risk, sometimes oceans of risk. What looks predictable in insurance\ncan be anything but. Take the famous Lloyds insurance market, which produced decent results for three centuries. Inthe 1980’s, though, huge latent problems from a few long-tail lines of insurance surfaced at Lloyds and, for a time,threatened to destroy its storied operation. (It has, I should add, fully recovered.)\nBerkshire’s insurance managers are conservative and careful underwriters, who operate in a culture that has\nlong prioritized those qualities. That disciplined behavior has produced underwriting profits in most years, and in suchinstances, our cost of float was less than zero. In effect, we got paid then for holding the huge sums tallied in the\nearlier table.\nI have warned you, however, that we have been fortunate in recent years and that the catastrophe-light period\nthe industry was experiencing was not a new norm. Last September drove home that point, as three significanthurricanes hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.\n7\n\nMy guess at this time is that the insured losses arising from the hurricanes are $100 billion or so. That figure,\nhowever, could be faroff the mark. The pattern with most mega-catastrophes has been that initial loss estimates ran\nlow. As well-known analyst V.J. Dowling has pointed out, the loss reserves of an insurer are similar to a self-gradedexam. Ignorance, wishful thinking or, occasionally, downright fraud can deliver inaccurate figures about an insurer’sfinancial condition for a very long time.\nWe currently estimate Berkshire’s losses from the three hurricanes to be $3 billion (or about $2 billion after\ntax). If both that estimate and my industry estimate of $100 billion are close to accurate, our share of the industry losswas about 3%. I believe that percentage is also what we may reasonably expect to be our share of losses in futureAmerican mega-cats.\nIt’s worth noting that the $2 billion net cost from the three hurricanes reduced Berkshire’s GAAP net worth\nby less than 1%. Elsewhere in the reinsurance industry there were many companies that suffered losses in net worthranging from 7% to more than 15%. The damage to them could have been farworse: Had Hurricane Irma followed a\npath through Florida only a bit to the east, insured losses might well have been an additional $100 billion.\nWe believe that the annual probability of a U.S. mega-catastrophe causing $400 billion or more of insured\nlosses is about 2%. No one, of course, knows the correct probability. We do know, however, that the risk increasesover time because of growth in both the number and value of structures located in catastrophe-vulnerable areas.\nNo company comes close to Berkshire in being financially prepared for a $400 billion mega-cat. Our share\nof such a loss might be $12 billion or so, an amount far below the annual earnings we expect from our non-insuranceactivities. Concurrently, much – indeed, perhaps most – of the p/c world would be out of business. Our unparalleledfinancial strength explains why other p/c insurers come to Berkshire – and only Berkshire – when they, themselves,\nneed to purchase huge reinsurance coverages for large payments they may have to make in the far future.\nPrior to 2017, Berkshire had recorded 14 consecutive years of underwriting profits, which totaled $28.3\nbillion pre-tax. I have regularly told you that I expect Berkshire to attain an underwriting profit in a majority of years,but also to experience losses from time to time. My warning became fact in 2017, as we lost $3.2 billion pre-tax fromunderwriting.\nA large amount of additional information about our various insurance operations is included in the 10-K at\nthe back of this report. The only point I will add here is that you have some extraordinary managers working for youat our various p/c operations. This is a business in which there are no trade secrets, patents, or locational advantages.What counts are brains and capital. The managers of our various insurance companies supply the brains and Berkshireprovides the capital.\n************\nFor many years, this letter has described the activities of Berkshire’s many other businesses. That discussion\nhas become both repetitious and partially duplicative of information regularly included in the 10-K that follows theletter. Consequently, this year I will give you a simple summary of our dozens of non-insurance businesses. Additionaldetails can be found on pages K-5 – K-22 and pages K-40 – K-50.\nViewed as a group – and excluding investment income – our operations other than insurance delivered pre-\ntax income of $20 billion in 2017, an increase of $950 million over 2016. About 44% of the 2017 profit came from twosubsidiaries. BNSF, our railroad, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (of which we own 90.2%). You can read moreabout these businesses on pages K-5 – K-10 and pages K-40 – K-44.\nProceeding down Berkshire’s long list of subsidiaries, our next five non-insurance businesses, as ranked by\nearnings (but presented here alphabetically) Clayton Homes, International Metalworking Companies, Lubrizol,Marmon and Precision Castparts had aggregate pre-tax income in 2017 of $5.5 billion, little changed from the $5.4billion these companies earned in 2016.\nThe next five, similarly ranked and listed (Forest River, Johns Manville, MiTek, Shaw and TTI) earned $2.1\nbillion last year, up from $1.7 billion in 2016.\n8\n\nThe remaining businesses that Berkshire owns – and there are many – recorded little change in pre-tax\nincome, which was $3.7 billion in 2017 versus $3.5 billion in 2016.\nDepreciation charges for all of these non-insurance operations totaled $7.6 billion; capital expenditures were\n$11.5 billion. Berkshire is always looking for ways to expand its businesses and regularly incurs capital expendituresthat far exceed its depreciation charge. Almost 90% of our investments are made in the United States. America’seconomic soil remains fertile.\nAmortization charges were an additional $1.3 billion. I believe that in large part this item is not a true\neconomic cost. Partially offsetting this good news is the fact that BNSF (like all other railroads) records depreciationcharges that fall well short of the sums regularly needed to keep the railroad in first-class shape.\nBerkshire’s goal is to substantially increase the earnings of its non-insurance group. For that to happen, we\nwill need to make one or more huge acquisitions. We certainly have the resources to do so. At yearend Berkshire held$116.0 billion in cash and U.S. Treasury Bills (whose average maturity was 88 days), up from $86.4 billion at yearend2016. This extraordinary liquidity earns only a pittance and is far beyond the level Charlie and I wish Berkshire tohave. Our smiles will broaden when we have redeployed Berkshire’s excess funds into more productive assets.\nInvestments\nBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value. We exclude\nour Kraft Heinz holding – 325,442,152 shares – because Berkshire is part of a control group and therefore mustaccount for this investment on the “equity” method. On its balance sheet, Berkshire carries its Kraft Heinz holding ata GAAP figure of $17.6 billion. The shares had a yearend market value of $25.3 billion, and a cost basis of $9.8 billion.\n12/31/17\nShares* CompanyPercentage of\nCompany\nOwned Cost** Market\n(in millions)\n151,610,700 American Express Company .................. 17.6 $ 1,287 $ 15,056\n166,713,209 Apple Inc. ................................. 3 . 3 20,961 28,213\n700,000,000 Bank of America Corporation ................. 6 . 8 5,007 20,664\n53,307,534 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation ...... 5 . 3 2,230 2,871\n225,000,000 BYD Company Ltd. ......................... 8 . 2 2 3 2 1,961\n6,789,054 Charter Communications, Inc. ................. 2 . 8 1,210 2,281\n400,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company ..................... 9 . 4 1,299 18,352\n53,110,395 Delta Airlines Inc. .......................... 7 . 4 2,219 2,974\n44,527,147 General Motors Company .................... 3 . 2 1,343 1,825\n11,390,582 The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. ............... 3 . 0 6 5 4 2,902\n24,669,778 Moody’s Corporation ........................ 12.9 248 3,642\n74,587,892 Phillips 66 ................................. 14.9 5,841 7,545\n47,659,456 Southwest Airlines Co. ....................... 8 . 1 1,997 3,119\n103,855,045 U.S. Bancorp .............................. 6 . 3 3,343 5,565\n482,544,468 Wells Fargo & Company ..................... 9 . 9 11,837 29,276\nOthers .................................... 14,968 24,294\nTotal Common Stocks Carried at Market ......... $ 74,676 $ 170,540\n* Excludes shares held by pension funds of Berkshire subsidiaries.\n** This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP “cost” differs in a few cases because of\nwrite-downs that have been required under GAAP rules.\n9\n\nSome of the stocks in the table are the responsibility of either Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, who work with\nme in managing Berkshire’s investments. Each, independently of me , manages more than $12 billion; I usually learn\nabout decisions they have made by looking at monthly portfolio summaries. Included in the $25 billion that the twomanage is more than $8 billion of pension trust assets of certain Berkshire subsidiaries. As noted, pension investmentsare not included in the preceding tabulation of Berkshire holdings.\n************\nCharlie and I view the marketable common stocks that Berkshire owns as interests in businesses , not as ticker\nsymbols to be bought or sold based on their “chart” patterns, the “target” prices of analysts or the opinions of mediapundits. Instead, we simply believe that if the businesses of the investees are successful (as we believe most will be)our investments will be successful as well. Sometimes the payoffs to us will be modest; occasionally the cash registerwill ring loudly. And sometimes I will make expensive mistakes. Overall – and over time – we should get decentresults. In America, equity investors have the wind at their back.\nFrom our stock portfolio – call our holdings “minority interests” in a diversified group of publicly-owned\nbusinesses – Berkshire received $3.7 billion of dividends in 2017. That’s the number included in our GAAP figures,as well as in the “operating earnings” we reference in our quarterly and annual reports.\nThat dividend figure, however, farunderstates the “true” earnings emanating from our stock holdings. For\ndecades, we have stated in Principle 6 of our “Owner-Related Business Principles” (page 19) that we expectundistributed earnings of our investees to deliver us at least equivalent earnings by way of subsequent capital gains.\nOur recognition of capital gains (and losses) will be lumpy, particularly as we conform with the new GAAP\nrule requiring us to constantly record unrealized gains or losses in our earnings. I feel confident, however, that the\nearnings retained by our investees will over time, and with our investees viewed as a group, translate intocommensurate capital gains for Berkshire.\nThe connection of value-building to retained earnings that I’ve just described will be impossible to detect in\nthe short term. Stocks surge and swoon, seemingly untethered to any year-to-year buildup in their underlying value.Over time, however, Ben Graham’s oft-quoted maxim proves true: “In the short run, the market is a voting machine;in the long run, however, it becomes a weighing machine.”\n************\nBerkshire, itself, provides some vivid examples of how price randomness in the short term can obscure long-\nterm growth in value. For the last 53 years, the company has built value by reinvesting its earnings and lettingcompound interest work its magic. Year by year, we have moved forward. Yet Berkshire shares have suffered fourtruly major dips. Here are the gory details:\nPeriod High Low Percentage Decrease\nMarch 1973-January 1975 93 38 (59.1%)\n10/2/87-10/27/87 4,250 2,675 (37.1%)6/19/98-3/10/2000 80,900 41,300 (48.9%)9/19/08-3/5/09 147,000 72,400 (50.7%)\nThis table offers the strongest argument I can muster against ever using borrowed money to own stocks.\nThere is simply no telling how far stocks can fall in a short period. Even if your borrowings are small and yourpositions aren’t immediately threatened by the plunging market, your mind may well become rattled by scary headlinesand breathless commentary. And an unsettled mind will not make good decisions.\n10\n\nIn the next 53 years our shares (and others) will experience declines resembling those in the table. No one\ncan tell you when these will happen. The light can at any time go from green to red without pausing at yellow.\nWhen major declines occur, however, they offer extraordinary opportunities to those who are not handicapped\nby debt. That’s the time to heed these lines from Kipling’s If:\n“If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs . . .\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting . . .If you can think – and not make thoughts your aim . . .If you can trust yourself when all men doubt yo u...\nYours is the Earth and everything that’s in it.”\n“The Bet” is Over and Has Delivered an Unforeseen Investment Lesson\nLast year, at the 90% mark, I gave you a detailed report on a ten-year bet I had made on December 19, 2007.\n(The full discussion from last year’s annual report is reprinted on pages 24 – 26.) Now I have the final tally – and, inseveral respects, it’s an eye-opener.\nI made the bet for two reasons: (1) to leverage my outlay of $318,250 into a disproportionately larger sum\nthat – if things turned out as I expected – would be distributed in early 2018 to Girls Inc. of Omaha; and (2) topublicize my conviction that my pick – a virtually cost-free investment in an unmanaged S&P 500 index fund – would,over time, deliver better results than those achieved by most investment professionals, however well-regarded andincentivized those “helpers” may be.\nAddressing this question is of enormous importance. American investors pay staggering sums annually to\nadvisors, often incurring several layers of consequential costs. In the aggregate, do these investors get their money’sworth? Indeed, again in the aggregate, do investors get anything for their outlays?\nProtégé Partners, my counterparty to the bet, picked five “funds-of-funds” that it expected to overperform\nthe S&P 500. That was nota small sample. Those five funds-of-funds in turn owned interests in more than 200 hedge\nfunds.\nEssentially, Protégé, an advisory firm that knew its way around Wall Street, selected five investment experts\nwho, in turn, employed several hundred other investment experts, each managing his or her own hedge fund. Thisassemblage was an elite crew, loaded with brains, adrenaline and confidence.\nThe managers of the five funds-of-funds possessed a further advantage: They could – and did – rearrange\ntheir portfolios of hedge funds during the ten years, investing with new “stars” while exiting their positions in hedgefunds whose managers had lost their touch.\nEvery actor on Protégé’s side was highly incentivized: Both the fund-of-funds managers and the hedge-fund\nmanagers they selected significantly shared in gains, even those achieved simply because the market generally movesupwards. (In 100% of the 43 ten-year periods since we took control of Berkshire, years with gains by the S&P 500\nexceeded loss years.)\nThose performance incentives, it should be emphasized, were frosting on a huge and tasty cake: Even if the\nfunds lostmoney for their investors during the decade, their managers could grow very rich. That would occur because\nfixed fees averaging a staggering 2\n1⁄2% of assets or so were paid every year by the fund-of-funds’ investors, with part\nof these fees going to the managers at the five funds-of-funds and the balance going to the 200-plus managers of theunderlying hedge funds.\n11\n\nHere’s the final scorecard for the bet:\nYearFund-of-\nFunds AFund-of-\nFunds BFund-of-\nFunds CFund-of-\nFunds DFund-of-\nFunds ES&P\nIndex Fund\n2008 -16.5% -22.3% -21.3% -29.3% -30.1% -37.0%\n2009 11.3% 14.5% 21.4% 16.5% 16.8% 26.6%2010 5.9% 6.8% 13.3% 4.9% 11.9% 15.1%2011 -6.3% -1.3% 5.9% -6.3% -2.8% 2.1%2012 3.4% 9.6% 5.7% 6.2% 9.1% 16.0%2013 10.5% 15.2% 8.8% 14.2% 14.4% 32.3%2014 4.7% 4.0% 18.9% 0.7% -2.1% 13.6%2015 1.6% 2.5% 5.4% 1.4% -5.0% 1.4%2016 -3.2% 1.9% -1.7% 2.5% 4.4% 11.9%2017 12.2% 10.6% 15.6% N/A 18.0% 21.8%\nFinal Gain 21.7% 42.3% 87.7% 2.8% 27.0% 125.8%\nAverage\nAnnual Gain 2.0% 3.6% 6.5% 0.3% 2.4% 8.5%\nFootnote: Under my agreement with Protégé Partners, the names of these funds-of-funds have never been publicly\ndisclosed. I, however, have received their annual audits from Protégé. The 2016 figures for funds A, Band C were revised slightly from those originally reported last year. Fund D was liquidated in 2017; itsaverage annual gain is calculated for the nine years of its operation.\nThe five funds-of-funds got off to a fast start, each beating the index fund in 2008. Then the roof fell in. In\nevery one of the nine years that followed, the funds-of-funds as a whole trailed the index fund.\nLet me emphasize that there was nothing aberrational about stock-market behavior over the ten-year stretch.\nIf a poll of investment “experts” had been asked late in 2007 for a forecast of long-term common-stock returns, theirguesses would have likely averaged close to the 8.5% actually delivered by the S&P 500. Making money in thatenvironment should have been easy. Indeed, Wall Street “helpers” earned staggering sums. While this groupprospered, however, many of their investors experienced a lost decade.\nPerformance comes, performance goes. Fees never falter.\n************\nThe bet illuminated another important investment lesson: Though markets are generally rational, they\noccasionally do crazy things. Seizing the opportunities then offered does notrequire great intelligence, a degree in\neconomics or a familiarity with Wall Street jargon such as alpha and beta. What investors then need instead is anability to both disregard mob fears or enthusiasms and to focus on a few simple fundamentals. A willingness to lookunimaginative for a sustained period – or even to look foolish – is also essential.\nOriginally, Protégé and I each funded our portion of the ultimate $1 million prize by purchasing $500,000\nface amount of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds (sometimes called “strips”). These bonds cost each of us $318,250 –a bit less than 64¢ on the dollar – with the $500,000 payable in ten years.\nAs the name implies, the bonds we acquired paid no interest, but (because of the discount at which they were\npurchased) delivered a 4.56% annual return if held to maturity. Protégé and I originally intended to do no more thantally the annual returns and distribute $1 million to the winning charity when the bonds matured late in 2017.\n12\n\nAfter our purchase, however, some very strange things took place in the bond market. By November 2012,\nour bonds – now with about five years to go before they matured – were selling for 95.7% of their face value. At that\nprice, their annual yield to maturity was less than 1%. Or, to be precise, .88% .\nGiven that pathetic return, our bonds had become a dumb – a really dumb – investment compared to\nAmerican equities. Over time, the S&P 500 – which mirrors a huge cross-section of American business, appropriatelyweighted by market value – has earned farmore than 10% annually on shareholders’ equity (net worth).\nIn November 2012, as we were considering all this, the cash return from dividends on the S&P 500 was 2\n1⁄2%\nannually, about triple the yield on our U.S. Treasury bond. These dividend payments were almost certain to grow.Beyond that, huge sums were being retained by the companies comprising the 500. These businesses would use theirretained earnings to expand their operations and, frequently, to repurchase their shares as well. Either course would,over time, substantially increase earnings-per-share. And – as has been the case since 1776 – whatever its problems ofthe minute, the American economy was going to move forward.\nPresented late in 2012 with the extraordinary valuation mismatch between bonds and equities, Protégé and\nI agreed to sell the bonds we had bought five years earlier and use the proceeds to buy 11,200 Berkshire “B” shares.The result: Girls Inc. of Omaha found itself receiving $2,222,279 last month rather than the $1 million it had originallyhoped for.\nBerkshire, it should be emphasized, has not performed brilliantly since the 2012 substitution. But brilliance\nwasn’t needed: After all, Berkshire’s gain only had to beat that annual .88% bond bogey – hardly a Herculeanachievement.\nThe only risk in the bonds-to-Berkshire switch was that yearend 2017 would coincide with an exceptionally\nweak stock market. Protégé and I felt this possibility (which always exists) was very low. Two factors dictated this\nconclusion: The reasonable price of Berkshire in late 2012, and the large asset build-up that was almost certain to occurat Berkshire during the five years that remained before the bet would be settled. Even so, to eliminate allrisk to the\ncharities from the switch, I agreed to make up any shortfall if sales of the 11,200 Berkshire shares at yearend 2017didn’t produce at least $1 million.\n************\nInvesting is an activity in which consumption today is foregone in an attempt to allow greater consumption\nat a later date. “Risk” is the possibility that this objective won’t be attained.\nBy that standard, purportedly “risk-free” long-term bonds in 2012 were a farriskier investment than a long-\nterm investment in common stocks. At that time, even a 1% annual rate of inflation between 2012 and 2017 wouldhave decreased the purchasing-power of the government bond that Protégé and I sold.\nI want to quickly acknowledge that in anyupcoming day, week or even year, stocks will be riskier – far\nriskier – than short-term U.S. bonds. As an investor’s investment horizon lengthens, however, a diversified portfolioof U.S. equities becomes progressively lessrisky than bonds, assuming that the stocks are purchased at a sensible\nmultiple of earnings relative to then-prevailing interest rates.\nIt is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons – among them, pension funds, college\nendowments and savings-minded individuals – to measure their investment “risk” by their portfolio’s ratio of bondsto stocks. Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk.\n************\nA final lesson from our bet: Stick with big, “easy” decisions and eschew activity. During the ten-year bet,\nthe 200-plus hedge-fund managers that were involved almost certainly made tens of thousands of buy and selldecisions. Most of those managers undoubtedly thought hard about their decisions, each of which they believed wouldprove advantageous. In the process of investing, they studied 10-Ks, interviewed managements, read trade journalsand conferred with Wall Street analysts.\n13\n\nProtégé and I, meanwhile, leaning neither on research, insights nor brilliance, made only one investment\ndecision during the ten years. We simply decided to sell our bond investment at a price of more than 100 times earnings(95.7 sale price/.88 yield), those being “earnings” that could not increase during the ensuing five years.\nWe made the sale in order to move our money into a single security – Berkshire – that, in turn, owned a\ndiversified group of solid businesses. Fueled by retained earnings, Berkshire’s growth in value was unlikely to be lessthan 8% annually, even if we were to experience a so-so economy.\nAfter that kindergarten-like analysis, Protégé and I made the switch and relaxed, confident that, over time, 8%\nwas certain to beat .88%. By a lot.\nThe Annual Meeting\nThe annual meeting falls on May 5\nthand will again be webcast by Yahoo!, whose web address is\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/brklivestream. The webcast will go live at 8:45 a.m. Central Daylight Time. Yahoo! willinterview directors, managers, stockholders and celebrities before the meeting and during the lunch break. Both theinterviews and meeting will be translated simultaneously into Mandarin.\nOur partnership with Yahoo! began in 2016 and shareholders have responded enthusiastically. Last year,\nreal-time viewership increased 72% to about 3.1 million and replays of short segments totaled 17.1 million.\nFor those attending the meeting in person, the doors at the CenturyLink will open at 7:00 a.m. on Saturday\nto facilitate shopping prior to our shareholder movie, which begins at 8:30. The question-and-answer period will startat 9:15 and run until 3:30, with a one-hour lunch break at noon. Finally, at 3:45 we will begin the formal shareholdermeeting, which usually runs from 15 to 45 minutes. Shopping will end at 4:30.\nOn Friday, May 4\nth, our Berkshire exhibitors at CenturyLink will be open from noon until 5 p.m. We added\nthat extra shopping time in 2015, and serious shoppers love it. Last year about 12,000 people came through the doorsin the five hours we were open on Friday.\nYour venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in which\nproducts from dozens of our subsidiaries will be for sale . (Your Chairman discourages freebies.) Say hello to the many\nBerkshire managers who will be captaining their exhibits. And be sure to view the terrific BNSF railroad layout thatsalutes all of our companies.\nBrooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at the meeting.\nAfter you purchase a pair, wear them on Sunday at our sixth annual “Berkshire 5K,” an 8 a.m. race starting at theCenturyLink. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor’s Guide that will be sent to you with yourmeeting credentials. Entrants in the race will find themselves running alongside many of Berkshire’s managers,directors and associates. (Charlie and I, however, will sleep in; even with Brooks running shoes, our times would beembarrassing.) Participation in the 5K grows every year. Help us set another record.\nA GEICO booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company’s top counselors from\naround the country. At last year’s meeting, we set a record for policy sales, up 43% from 2016.\nSo stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount (usually 8%).\nThis special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental point: The discountis not additive if you qualify for another discount, such as that available to certain groups.) Bring the details of yourexisting insurance and check out our price. We can save many of you real money. Spend the savings on other Berkshireproducts.\nBe sure to visit the Bookworm. This Omaha-based retailer will carry more than 40 books and DVDs, among\nthem a couple of new titles. Berkshire shareholders are a bookseller’s dream: When Poor Charlie’s Almanack (yes,\nourCharlie) made its debut some years ago, we sold 3,500 copies at the meeting. The book weighed 4.85 pounds. Do\nthe math: Our shareholders left the building that day carrying about 8\n1⁄2tons of Charlie’s wisdom.\n14\n\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to both the meeting and other events. Keep in mind that most airlinessubstantially increase prices for the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flyingto Kansas City vs. Omaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2\n1⁄2hours, and it may be that Kansas City can\nsave you significant money. The savings for a couple could run to $1,000 or more. Spend that money with us.\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72ndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we will\nagain be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. To obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must makeyour purchases between Tuesday, May 1\nstand Monday, May 7thinclusive, and must also present your meeting\ncredential. Last year, the one-week volume for the store was a staggering $44.6 million. Bricks and mortar are aliveand well at NFM.\nThe period’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that\nnormally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made anexception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. During “Berkshire Weekend,” NFM will be open from 10 a.m. to9 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday. From 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday, NFM ishosting a picnic to which you are all invited.\nNFM will again extend its shareholder’s discount offerings to our Kansas City and Dallas stores. From May\n1\nstthrough May 7th, shareholders who present meeting credentials or other evidence of their Berkshire ownership (such\nas brokerage statements) to those NFM stores will receive the same discounts enjoyed by those visiting the Omahastore.\nAt Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from\n6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 4\nth. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 6th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nOn Saturday, we will remain open until 6 p.m. Remember, the more you buy, the more you save (or so my daughtertells me when we visit the store).\nWe will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 30\nththrough Saturday, May 12th. During that period, please\nidentify yourself as a shareholder either by presenting your meeting credential or a brokerage statement showing youown our stock.\nOn Sunday afternoon, on the upper level above Borsheims, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg,\ntwo of the world’s top bridge experts, available to play with our shareholders. If they suggest wagering on the game,change the subject. Ajit, Charlie, Bill Gates and I will likely drop by as well.\nMy friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. I met\nAriel when she was nine, and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Ariel represented the United Statesin the 2012 Olympics. If you don’t mind embarrassing yourself, test your skills against her, beginning at 1 p.m. BillGates did pretty well playing Ariel last year, so he may be ready to again challenge her. (My advice: Bet on Ariel.) Iwill participate on an advisory basis only.\nGorat’s will be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 6\nth, serving from 12 p.m. until\n10 p.m. To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call 402-551-3733 on April 2nd(but not before ). Show you are a sophisticated\ndiner by ordering the T-bone with hash browns.\nWe will have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the meeting, asking\nCharlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mailaddresses are: Carol Loomis, the preeminent business journalist of her time, who may be e-mailed atloomisbrk@gmail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of theNew York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.\n15\n\nFrom the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most interesting\nand important to shareholders. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if youkeep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than twoquestions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentionedif your question is asked.)\nAn accompanying set of questions will be asked by three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the\ninsurance specialist will be Gary Ransom of Dowling & Partners. Questions that deal with our non-insuranceoperations will come from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Sincewhat we will be conducting is a shareholders’ meeting, our hope is that the analysts and journalists will ask questions\nthat add to our owners’ understanding and knowledge of their investment.\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough,\nfor sure, and that’s the way we like it. Multi-part questions aren’t allowed; we want to give as many questioners aspossible a shot at us. Our goal is for you to leave the meeting knowing more about Berkshire than when you came andfor you to have a good time while in Omaha.\nAll told, we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and for\n18 from the audience. After the 54\nth, all questions come from the audience. Charlie and I have often tackled more than\n60 by 3:30.\nThe questioners from the audience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that will take place at 8:15 a.m.\non the morning of the annual meeting. Each of the 11 microphones installed in the arena and main overflow room willhost, so to speak, a drawing.\nWhile I’m on the subject of our owners’ gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believe\nall shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and, if possible, shouldalso have adequate time to digest and analyze that information before any trading takes place. That’s why we try toissue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on a Saturday (aday that also eases traffic and parking problems).\nWe do not follow the common practice of talking one-on-one with large institutional investors or analysts,\ntreating them instead as we do all other shareholders. There is no one more important to us than the shareholder oflimited means who trusts us with a substantial portion of his or her savings. As I run the company day-to-day – andas I write this letter – that is the shareholder whose image is in my mind.\n************\nFor good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-Stars\nwho run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I also believe the mindset of ourmanagers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most ofour managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business “home runs” means as much to them as theirpaycheck.\nIf managers (or directors) own Berkshire shares – and many do – it’s from open-market purchases they\nhave made or because they received shares when they sold their businesses to us. None , however, gets the upside of\nownership without risking the downside. Our directors and managers stand in your shoes.\nWe continue to have a wonderful group at headquarters. This team efficiently deals with a multitude of\nSEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 32,700-page Federal income tax return, oversees the filing of 3,935state tax returns, responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for thecountry’s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board’s activities, fact-checks this letter – and the list goes on andon.\n16\n\nThey handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy\nand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year, for example, they dealt withthe 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They alsohandle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and French fries (smotheredin Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. In addition, they cheerfully pitch in to help at the annual meeting in whateverway they are needed. They are proud to work for Berkshire, and I am proud of them.\n************\nI’ve saved the best for last. Early in 2018, Berkshire’s board elected Ajit Jain and Greg Abel as directors\nof Berkshire and also designated each as Vice Chairman. Ajit is now responsible for insurance operations, and Gregoversees the rest of our businesses. Charlie and I will focus on investments and capital allocation.\nYou and I are lucky to have Ajit and Greg working for us. Each has been with Berkshire for decades, and\nBerkshire’s blood flows through their veins. The character of each man matches his talents. And that says it all.\nCome to Omaha – the cradle of capitalism – on May 5\nthand meet the Berkshire Bunch. All of us look\nforward to your visit.\nFebruary 24, 2018 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board\n17",

Starting in 1979, accounting rules\nrequired insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at mar ket rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previously the req uirement.\nIn this table, Berkshire’s results through 1978 have been restated to confor m to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculated u sing the\nnumbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax . If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply\nto have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results woul d have lagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return,\nbut would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative r eturn. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to\nbe substantial.\n2\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshire earned $4.0 billion in 2018 utilizing generally accepted accounting principles (commonly called\n“GAAP”). The components of that figure are $24.8 billion in operating earnings, a $3.0 billion non-cash loss from animpairment of intangible assets (arising almost entirely from our equity interest in Kraft Heinz), $2.8 billion in realizedcapital gains from the sale of investment securities and a $20.6 billion lossfrom a reduction in the amount of unrealized\ncapital gains that existed in our investment holdings.\nA new GAAP rule requires us to include that last item in earnings. As I emphasized in the 2017 annual report,\nneither Berkshire’s Vice Chairman, Charlie Munger, nor I believe that rule to be sensible. Rather, both of us haveconsistently thought that at Berkshire this mark-to-market change would produce what I described as “wild andcapricious swings in our bottom line.”\nThe accuracy of that prediction can be suggested by our quarterly results during 2018. In the first and fourth\nquarters, we reported GAAP losses of $1.1 billion and $25.4 billion respectively. In the second and third quarters, we\nreported profits of $12 billion and $18.5 billion. In complete contrast to these gyrations, the many businesses that\nBerkshire owns delivered consistent and satisfactory operating earnings in allquarters. For the year, those earnings\nexceeded their 2016 high of $17.6 billion by 41%.\nWide swings in our quarterly GAAP earnings will inevitably continue. That’s because our huge equity\nportfolio – valued at nearly $173 billion at the end of 2018 – will often experience one-day price fluctuations of $2billion or more, all of which the new rule says must be dropped immediately to our bottom line. Indeed, in the fourthquarter, a period of high volatility in stock prices, we experienced several days with a “profit” or “loss” of more than$4 billion.\nOur advice? Focus on operating earnings, paying little attention to gains or losses of any variety. My saying\nthat in no way diminishes the importance of our investments to Berkshire. Over time, Charlie and I expect them todeliver substantial gains, albeit with highly irregular timing.\n************\nLong-time readers of our annual reports will have spotted the different way in which I opened this letter. For\nnearly three decades, the initial paragraph featured the percentage change in Berkshire’s per-share book value. It’snow time to abandon that practice.\nThe fact is that the annual change in Berkshire’s book value – which makes its farewell appearance on page\n2 – is a metric that has lost the relevance it once had. Three circumstances have made that so. First, Berkshire hasgradually morphed from a company whose assets are concentrated in marketable stocks into one whose major valueresides in operating businesses. Charlie and I expect that reshaping to continue in an irregular manner. Second, whileourequity holdings are valued at market prices, accounting rules require our collection of operating companies to be\nincluded in book value at an amount far below their current value, a mismark that has grown in recent years. Third, itis likely that – over time – Berkshire will be a significant repurchaser of its shares, transactions that will take place atprices above book value but below our estimate of intrinsic value. The math of such purchases is simple: Eachtransaction makes per-share intrinsic value go up, while per-share book value goes down. That combination causesthe book-value scorecard to become increasingly out of touch with economic reality.\n3\n\nIn future tabulations of our financial results, we expect to focus on Berkshire’s market price. Markets can be\nextremely capricious: Just look at the 54-year history laid out on page 2. Over time, however, Berkshire’s stock pricewill provide the best measure of business performance.\n************\nBefore moving on, I want to give you some good news – really good news – that is not reflected in our\nfinancial statements. It concerns the management changes we made in early 2018, when Ajit Jain was put in chargeof all insurance activities and Greg Abel was given authority over all other operations. These moves were overdue.Berkshire is now far better managed than when I alone was supervising operations. Ajit and Greg have rare talents,and Berkshire blood flows through their veins.\nNow let’s take a look at what you own.\nFocus on the Forest – Forget the Trees\nInvestors who evaluate Berkshire sometimes obsess on the details of our many and diverse businesses – our\neconomic “trees,” so to speak. Analysis of that type can be mind-numbing, given that we own a vast array ofspecimens, ranging from twigs to redwoods. A few of our trees are diseased and unlikely to be around a decade fromnow. Many others, though, are destined to grow in size and beauty.\nFortunately, it’s not necessary to evaluate each tree individually to make a rough estimate of Berkshire’s\nintrinsic business value. That’s because our forest contains five “groves” of major importance, each of which can beappraised, with reasonable accuracy, in its entirety. Four of those groves are differentiated clusters of businesses andfinancial assets that are easy to understand. The fifth – our huge and diverse insurance operation – delivers great valueto Berkshire in a less obvious manner, one I will explain later in this letter.\nBefore we look more closely at the first four groves, let me remind you of our prime goal in the deployment\nof your capital: to buy ably-managed businesses, in whole or part , that possess favorable and durable economic\ncharacteristics. We also need to make these purchases at sensible prices.\nSometimes we can buy control of companies that meet our tests. Far more often, we find the attributes we\nseek in publicly-traded businesses, in which we normally acquire a 5% to 10% interest. Our two-pronged approach tohuge-scale capital allocation is rare in corporate America and, at times, gives us an important advantage.\nIn recent years, the sensible course for us to follow has been clear: Many stocks have offered far more for\nour money than we could obtain by purchasing businesses in their entirety. That disparity led us to buy about $43billion of marketable equities last year, while selling only $19 billion. Charlie and I believe the companies in whichwe invested offered excellent value, far exceeding that available in takeover transactions.\nDespite our recent additions to marketable equities, the most valuable grove in Berkshire’s forest remains the\nmany dozens of non-insurance businesses that Berkshire controls (usually with 100% ownership and never with lessthan 80%). Those subsidiaries earned $16.8 billion last year. When we say “earned,” moreover, we are describing whatremains after allincome taxes, interest payments, managerial compensation (whether cash or stock-based),\nrestructuring expenses, depreciation, amortization and home-office overhead.\nThat brand of earnings is a far cry from that frequently touted by Wall Street bankers and corporate CEOs.\nToo often, their presentations feature “adjusted EBITDA,” a measure that redefines “earnings” to exclude a variety ofall-too-real costs.\n4\n\nFor example, managements sometimes assert that their company’s stock-based compensation shouldn’t be\ncounted as an expense. (What else could it be – a giftfrom shareholders?) And restructuring expenses? Well, maybe\nlast year’s exact rearrangement won’t recur. But restructurings of one sort or another are common in business –Berkshire has gone down that road dozens of times, and our shareholders have always borne the costs of doing so.\nAbraham Lincoln once posed the question: “If you call a dog’s tail a leg, how many legs does it have?” and\nthen answered his own query: “Four, because calling a tail a leg doesn’t make it one.” Abe would have felt lonely onWall Street.\nCharlie and I do contend that our acquisition-related amortization expenses of $1.4 billion (detailed on page\nK-84) are not a true economic cost. We add back such amortization “costs” to GAAP earnings when we are evaluatingboth private businesses and marketable stocks.\nIn contrast, Berkshire’s $8.4 billion depreciation charge understates our true economic cost. In fact, we need\nto spend more than this sum annually to simply remain competitive in our many operations. Beyond those\n“maintenance” capital expenditures, we spend large sums in pursuit of growth. Overall, Berkshire invested a record$14.5 billion last year in plant, equipment and other fixed assets, with 89% of that spent in America.\nBerkshire’s runner-up grove by value is its collection of equities, typically involving a 5% to 10% ownership\nposition in a very large company. As noted earlier, our equity investments were worth nearly $173 billion at yearend,an amount far above their cost. If the portfolio had been sold at its yearend valuation, federal income tax of about$14.7 billion would have been payable on the gain. In all likelihood, we will hold most of these stocks for a long time.Eventually, however, gains generate taxes at whatever rate prevails at the time of sale.\nOur investees paid us dividends of $3.8 billion last year, a sum that will increase in 2019. Far more important\nthan the dividends, though, are the huge earnings that are annually retained by these companies. Consider, as anindicator, these figures that cover only our five largest holdings.\nYearend\nOwnership\nBerkshire’s Share in $ millions of\nCompany Dividends(1) Retained Earnings(2)\nAmerican Express 17.9% $ 237 $ 997\nApple 5.4% 745 2,502Bank of America 9.5% 551 2,096Coca-Cola 9.4% 624 (21)Wells Fargo 9.8% 809 1,263\nTotal $2,966 $6,837\n(1) Based on current annual rate.(2) Based on 2018 earnings minus common and preferred dividends paid.\nGAAP – which dictates the earnings we report – does not allow us to include the retained earnings of\ninvestees in our financial accounts. But those earnings are of enormous value to us: Over the years, earnings retainedby our investees (viewed as a group) have eventually delivered capital gains to Berkshire that totaled more than onedollar for each dollar these companies reinvested for us.\nAll of our major holdings enjoy excellent economics, and most use a portion of their retained earnings to\nrepurchase their shares. We very much like that: If Charlie and I think an investee’s stock is underpriced, we rejoicewhen management employs some of its earnings to increase Berkshire’s ownership percentage.\n5\n\nHere’s one example drawn from the table above: Berkshire’s holdings of American Express have remained\nunchanged over the past eight years. Meanwhile, our ownership increased from 12.6% to 17.9% because ofrepurchases made by the company. Last year, Berkshire’s portion of the $6.9 billion earned by American Express was$1.2 billion, about 96% of the $1.3 billion we paid for our stake in the company. When earnings increase and sharesoutstanding decrease, owners – over time – usually do well.\nA third category of Berkshire’s business ownership is a quartet of companies in which we share control with\nother parties. Our portion of the after-tax operating earnings of these businesses – 26.7% of Kraft Heinz, 50% ofBerkadia and Electric Transmission Texas, and 38.6% of Pilot Flying J – totaled about $1.3 billion in 2018.\nIn our fourth grove, Berkshire held $112 billion at yearend in U.S. Treasury bills and other cash equivalents,\nand another $20 billion in miscellaneous fixed-income instruments. We consider a portion of that stash to beuntouchable, having pledged to always hold at least $20 billion in cash equivalents to guard against external calamities.We have also promised to avoid anyactivities that could threaten our maintaining that buffer.\nBerkshire will forever remain a financial fortress. In managing, I will make expensive mistakes of\ncommission and will also miss many opportunities, some of which should have been obvious to me. At times, ourstock will tumble as investors flee from equities. But I will never risk getting caught short of cash.\nIn the years ahead, we hope to move much of our excess liquidity into businesses that Berkshire will\npermanently own. The immediate prospects for that, however, are not good: Prices are sky-high for businessespossessing decent long-term prospects.\nThat disappointing reality means that 2019 will likely see us again expanding our holdings of marketable\nequities. We continue, nevertheless, to hope for an elephant-sized acquisition. Even at our ages of 88 and 95 – I’m the\nyoung one – that prospect is what causes my heart and Charlie’s to beat faster. (Just writing about the possibility of a\nhuge purchase has caused my pulse rate to soar.)\nMy expectation of more stock purchases is nota market call. Charlie and I have no idea as to how stocks will\nbehave next week or next year. Predictions of that sort have never been a part of our activities. Our thinking, rather,\nis focused on calculating whether a portion of an attractive business is worth more than its market price.\n************\nI believe Berkshire’s intrinsic value can be approximate d by summing the values of our four asset-laden\ngroves and then subtracting an appropriate amount for taxes eventually payable on the sale of marketable securities.\nYou may ask whether an allowance should not also be made for the major tax costs Berkshire would incur if\nwe were to sell certain of our wholly-owned businesses. Forget that thought: It would be foolish for us to sell any ofour wonderful companies even if notax would be payable on its sale. Truly good businesses are exceptionally hard to\nfind. Selling any you are lucky enough to own makes no sense at all.\nThe interest cost on allof our debt has been deducted as an expense in calculating the earnings at Berkshire’s\nnon-insurance businesses. Beyond that, much of our ownership of the first four groves is financed by funds generatedfrom Berkshire’s fifth grove – a collection of exceptional insurance companies. We call those funds “float,” a sourceof financing that we expect to be cost-free – or maybe even better than that – over time. We will explain thecharacteristics of float later in this letter.\nFinally, a point of key and lasting importance: Berkshire’s value is maximized by our having assembled the\nfive groves into a single entity. This arrangement allows us to seamlessly and objectively allocate major amounts ofcapital, eliminate enterprise risk, avoid insularity, fund assets at exceptionally low cost, occasionally take advantageof tax efficiencies, and minimize overhead.\nAt Berkshire, the whole is greater – considerably greater – than the sum of the parts.\n6\n\nRepurchases and Reporting\nEarlier I mentioned that Berkshire will from time to time be repurchasing its own stock. Assuming that we\nbuy at a discount to Berkshire’s intrinsic value – which certainly will be our intention – repurchases will benefit boththose shareholders leaving the company and those who stay.\nTrue, the upside from repurchases is very slight for those who are leaving. That’s because careful buying by\nus will minimize any impact on Berkshire’s stock price. Nevertheless, there is some benefit to sellers in having an\nextra buyer in the market.\nFor continuing shareholders, the advantage is obvious: If the market prices a departing partner’s interest at,\nsay, 90¢ on the dollar, continuing shareholders reap an increase in per-share intrinsic value with every repurchase bythe company. Obviously, repurchases should be price-sensitive: Blindly buying an overpriced stock is value-destructive, a fact lost on many promotional or ever-optimistic CEOs.\nWhen a company says that it contemplates repurchases, it’s vital that all shareholder-partners be given the\ninformation they need to make an intelligent estimate of value. Providing that information is what Charlie and I try todo in this report. We do not want a partner to sell shares back to the company because he or she has been misled orinadequately informed.\nSome sellers, however, may disagree with our calculation of value and others may have found investments\nthat they consider more attractive than Berkshire shares. Some of that second group will be right: There areunquestionably many stocks that will deliver far greater gains than ours.\nIn addition, certain shareholders will simply decide it’s time for them or their families to become net\nconsumers rather than continuing to build capital. Charlie and I have no current interest in joining that group. Perhapswe will become big spenders in our old age.\n************\nFor 54 years our managerial decisions at Berkshire have been made from the viewpoint of the shareholders\nwho are staying, not those who are leaving. Consequently, Charlie and I have never focused on current-quarter results.\nBerkshire, in fact, may be the only company in the Fortune 500 that does not prepare monthly earnings reports\nor balance sheets. I, of course, regularly view the monthly financial reports of most subsidiaries. But Charlie and Ilearn of Berkshire’s overall earnings and financial position only on a quarterly basis.\nFurthermore, Berkshire has no company-wide budget (though many of our subsidiaries find one useful). Our\nlack of such an instrument means that the parent company has never had a quarterly “number” to hit. Shunning the\nuse of this bogey sends an important message to our many managers, reinforcing the culture we prize.\nOver the years, Charlie and I have seen all sorts of bad corporate behavior, both accounting and operational,\ninduced by the desire of management to meet Wall Street expectations. What starts as an “innocent” fudge in order tonot disappoint “the Street” – say, trade-loading at quarter-end, turning a blind eye to rising insurance losses, or drawingdown a “cookie-jar” reserve – can become the first step toward full-fledged fraud. Playing with the numbers “just thisonce” may well be the CEO’s intent; it’s seldom the end result. And if it’s okay for the boss to cheat a little, it’s easyfor subordinates to rationalize similar behavior.\nAt Berkshire, our audience is neither analysts nor commentators: Charlie and I are working for our\nshareholder-partners. The numbers that flow up to us will be the ones we send on to you.\n7\n\nNon-Insurance Operations – From Lollipops to Locomotives\nLet’s now look further at Berkshire’s most valuable grove – our collection of non-insurance businesses –\nkeeping in mind that we do not wish to unnecessarily hand our competitors information that might be useful to them.Additional details about individual operations can be found on pages K-5 – K-22 and pages K-40 – K-51.\nViewed as a group, these businesses earned pre-tax income in 2018 of $20.8 billion, a 24% increase over\n2017. Acquisitions we made in 2018 delivered only a trivial amount of that gain.\nI will stick with pre-tax figures in this discussion. But our after-tax gain in 2018 from these businesses was\nfargreater – 47 %– thanks in large part to the cut in the corporate tax rate that became effective at the beginning of\nthat year. Let’s look at why the impact was so dramatic.\nBegin with an economic reality: Like it or not, the U.S. Government “owns” an interest in Berkshire’s\nearnings of a size determined by Congress. In effect, our country’s Treasury Department holds a special class of ourstock – call this holding the AA shares – that receives large “dividends” (that is, tax payments) from Berkshire. In2017, as in many years before, the corporate tax rate was 35%, which meant that the Treasury was doing very wellwith its AA shares. Indeed, the Treasury’s “stock,” which was paying nothing when we took over in 1965, had evolvedinto a holding that delivered billions of dollars annually to the federal government.\nLast year, however, 40% of the government’s “ownership” (14/35\nths) was returned to Berkshire – free of\ncharge – when the corporate tax rate was reduced to 21%. Consequently, our “A” and “B” shareholders received amajor boost in the earnings attributable to their shares.\nThis happening materially increased the intrinsic value of the Berkshire shares you and I own. The same\ndynamic, moreover, enhanced the intrinsic value of almost all of the stocks Berkshire holds.\nThose are the headlines. But there are other factors to consider that tempered our gain. For example, the tax\nbenefits garnered by our large utility operation get passed along to its customers. Meanwhile, the tax rate applicableto the substantial dividends we receive from domestic corporations is little changed at about 13%. (This lower rate haslong been logical because our investees have already paid tax on the earnings that they pay to us.) Overall, however,the new law made our businesses and the stocks we own considerably more valuable.\nWhich suggests that we return to the performance of our non-insurance businesses. Our two towering redwoods\nin this grove are BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (90.9% owned). Combined, they earned $9.3 billion before taxlast year, up 6% from 2017. You can read more about these businesses on pages K-5 – K-10 and pages K-40 – K-45.\nOur next five non-insurance subsidiaries, as ranked by earnings (but presented here alphabetically), Clayton\nHomes, International Metalworking, Lubrizol, Marmon and Precision Castparts, had aggregate pre-tax income in 2018of $6.4 billion, up from the $5.5 billion these companies earned in 2017.\nThe next five, similarly ranked and listed (Forest River, Johns Manville, MiTek, Shaw and TTI) earned $2.4\nbillion pre-tax last year, up from $2.1 billion in 2017.\nThe remaining non-insurance businesses that Berkshire owns – and there are many – had pre-tax income of\n$3.6 billion in 2018 vs. $3.3 billion in 2017.\n8\n\nInsurance, “Float,” and the Funding of Berkshire\nOur property/casualty (“P/C”) insurance business – our fifth grove – has been the engine propelling\nBerkshire’s growth since 1967, the year we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire &Marine, for $8.6 million. Today, National Indemnity is the largest property/casualty company in the world as measuredby net worth.\nOne reason we were attracted to the P/C business was the industry’s business model: P/C insurers receive\npremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos, or severeworkplace accidents, payments can stretch over many decades.\nThis collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums – money we call “float” – that\nwill eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their own benefit. Though individualpolicies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation topremium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how it has grown, as the following\ntable shows:\nYear\nFloat (in millions)*\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322018 122,732\n* Includes float arising from life, annuity and health insurance businesses .\nWe may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be very gradual – at the outside no more\nthan 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate or near-\nterm demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. That structure is by design and is a keycomponent in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. That strength will never be compromised.\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers an\nunderwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy theuse of free money – and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous\nindeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. That loss, in\neffect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insurance industry,despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning subnormal returns ontangible net worth as compared to other American businesses.\nNevertheless, I like our own prospects. Berkshire’s unrivaled financial strength allows us far more flexibility\nin investing our float than that generally available to P/C companies. The many alternatives available to us are alwaysan advantage and occasionally offer major opportunities. When other insurers are constrained, our choices expand.\nMoreover, our P/C companies have an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at an\nunderwriting profit for 15 of the past 16 years, the exception being 2017, when our pre-tax loss was $3.2 billion. Forthe entire 16-year span, our pre-tax gain totaled $27 billion, of which $2 billion was recorded in 2018.\n9\n\nThat record is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of our insurance managers, who\nknow that the benefits of float can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service.At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.\n************\nIn most cases, the funding of a business comes from two sources – debt and equity. At Berkshire, we have\ntwo additional arrows in the quiver to talk about, but let’s first address the conventional components.\nWe use debt sparingly. Many managers, it should be noted, will disagree with this policy, arguing that\nsignificant debt juices the returns for equity owners. And these more venturesome CEOs will be right most of the time.\nAt rare and unpredictable intervals, however, credit vanishes and debt becomes financially fatal. A Russian-\nroulette equation – usually win, occasionally die – may make financial sense for someone who gets a piece of acompany’s upside but does not share in its downside. But that strategy would be madness for Berkshire. Rationalpeople don’t risk what they have and need for what they don’t have and don’t need.\nMost of the debt you see on our consolidated balance sheet – see page K-65 – resides at our railroad and\nenergy subsidiaries, both of them asset-heavy companies. During recessions, the cash generation of these businessesremains bountiful. The debt they use is both appropriate for their operations and notguaranteed by Berkshire.\nOur level of equity capital is a different story: Berkshire’s $349 billion is unmatched in corporate America. By\nretaining all earnings for a very long time, and allowing compound interest to work its magic, we have amassed fundsthat have enabled us to purchase and develop the valuable groves earlier described. Had we instead followed a 100%payout policy, we would still be working with the $22 million with which we began fiscal 1965.\nBeyond using debt and equity, Berkshire has benefitted in a major way from two less-common sources of\ncorporate funding. The larger is the float I have described. So far, those funds, though they are recorded as a huge netliability on our balance sheet, have been of more utility to us than an equivalent amount of equity. That’s because they\nhave usually been accompanied by underwriting earnings. In effect, we have been paid in most years for holding and\nusing other people’s money.\nAs I have often done before, I will emphasize that this happy outcome is far from a sure thing: Mistakes in\nassessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years to surface. (Think asbestos.) A major catastrophe thatwill dwarf hurricanes Katrina and Michael willoccur – perhaps tomorrow, perhaps many decades from now. “The\nBig One” may come from a traditional source, such as a hurricane or earthquake, or it may be a total surprise involving,say, a cyber attack having disastrous consequences beyond anything insurers now contemplate. When such a mega-catastrophe strikes, we will get our share of the losses and they will be big – very big. Unlike many other insurers,\nhowever, we will be looking to add business the next day.\nThe final funding source – which again Berkshire possesses to an unusual degree – is deferred income taxes.\nThese are liabilities that we will eventually pay but that are meanwhile interest-free.\nAs I indicated earlier, about $14.7 billion of our $50.5 billion of deferred taxes arises from the unrealized\ngains in our equity holdings. These liabilities are accrued in our financial statements at the current 21% corporate taxrate but will be paid at the rates prevailing when our investments are sold. Between now and then, we in effect havean interest-free “loan” that allows us to have more money working for us in equities than would otherwise be the case.\n10\n\nA further $28.3 billion of deferred tax results from our being able to accelerate the depreciation of assets such\nas plant and equipment in calculating the tax we must currently pay. The front-ended savings in taxes that we recordgradually reverse in future years. We regularly purchase additional assets, however. As long as the present tax lawprevails, this source of funding should trend upward.\nOver time, Berkshire’s funding base – that’s the right-hand side of our balance sheet – should grow, primarily\nthrough the earnings we retain. Our job is to put the money retained to good use on the left-hand side, by addingattractive assets.\nGEICO and Tony Nicely\nThat title says it all: The company and the man are inseparable.Tony joined GEICO in 1961 at the age of 18; I met him in the mid-1970s. At that time, GEICO, after a four-\ndecade record of both rapid growth and outstanding underwriting results, suddenly found itself near bankruptcy. Arecently-installed management had grossly underestimated GEICO’s loss costs and consequently underpriced itsproduct. It would take many months until those loss-generating policies on GEICO’s books – there were no less than2.3 million of them – would expire and could then be repriced. The company’s net worth in the meantime was rapidlyapproaching zero.\nIn 1976, Jack Byrne was brought in as CEO to rescue GEICO. Soon after his arrival, I met him, concluded\nthat he was the perfect man for the job, and began to aggressively buy GEICO shares. Within a few months, Berkshirebought about\n1⁄3of the company, a portion that later grew to roughly1⁄2without our spending a dime. That stunning\naccretion occurred because GEICO, after recovering its health, consistently repurchased its shares. All told, this half-interest in GEICO cost Berkshire $47 million, about what you might pay today for a trophy apartment in New York.\nLet’s now fast-forward 17 years to 1993, when Tony Nicely was promoted to CEO. At that point, GEICO’s\nreputation and profitability had been restored – but not its growth. Indeed, at yearend 1992 the company had only 1.9million auto policies on its books, far less than its pre-crisis high. In sales volume among U.S. auto insurers, GEICOthen ranked an undistinguished seventh.\nLate in 1995, after Tony had re-energized GEICO, Berkshire made an offer to buy the remaining 50% of the\ncompany for $2.3 billion, about 50 times what we had paid for the first half (and people say I never pay up!). Ouroffer was successful and brought Berkshire a wonderful, but underdeveloped, company and an equally wonderfulCEO, who would move GEICO forward beyond my dreams.\nGEICO is now America’s Number Two auto insurer, with sales 1,200% greater than it recorded in 1995.\nUnderwriting profits have totaled $15.5 billion (pre-tax) since our purchase, and float available for investment hasgrown from $2.5 billion to $22.1 billion.\nBy my estimate, Tony’s management of GEICO has increased Berkshire’s intrinsic value by more than $50\nbillion. On top of that, he is a model for everything a manager should be, helping his 40,000 associates to identify andpolish abilities they didn’t realize they possessed.\nLast year, Tony decided to retire as CEO, and on June 30\nthhe turned that position over to Bill Roberts, his\nlong-time partner. I’ve known and watched Bill operate for several decades, and once again Tony made the rightmove. Tony remains Chairman and will be helpful to GEICO for the rest of his life. He’s incapable of doing less.\nAllBerkshire shareholders owe Tony their thanks. Ihead the list.\n11\n\nInvestments\nBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value. We exclude\nour Kraft Heinz holding – 325,442,152 shares – because Berkshire is part of a control group and therefore mustaccount for this investment on the “equity” method. On its balance sheet, Berkshire carries its Kraft Heinz holding ata GAAP figure of $13.8 billion, an amount reduced by our share of the large write-off of intangible assets taken byKraft Heinz in 2018. At yearend, our Kraft Heinz holding had a market value of $14 billion and a cost basis of$9.8 billion.\n12/31/18\nShares* CompanyPercentage of\nCompany\nOwned Cost** Market\n(in millions)\n151,610,700 American Express Company ................. 17.9 $ 1,287 $ 14,452\n255,300,329 Apple Inc. ................................ 5 . 4 36,044 40,271\n918,919,000 Bank of America Corp. ...................... 9 . 5 11,650 22,642\n84,488,751 The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. .......... 8 . 8 3,860 3,977\n6,789,054 Charter Communications, Inc. ................ 3 . 0 1,210 1,935\n400,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company .................... 9 . 4 1,299 18,940\n65,535,000 Delta Air Lines, Inc. ........................ 9 . 6 2,860 3,270\n18,784,698 The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. .............. 4 . 9 2,380 3,138\n50,661,394 JPMorgan Chase & Co. ..................... 1 . 5 5,605 4,946\n24,669,778 Moody’s Corporation ....................... 12.9 248 3,455\n47,890,899 Southwest Airlines Co. ...................... 8 . 7 2,005 2,226\n21,938,642 United Continental Holdings Inc. .............. 8 . 1 1,195 1,837\n146,346,999 U.S. Bancorp ............................. 9 . 1 5,548 6,688\n43,387,980 USG Corporation .......................... 31.0 836 1,851\n449,349,102 Wells Fargo & Company .................... 9 . 8 10,639 20,706\nOthers ................................... 16,201 22,423\nTotal Common Stocks Carried at Market ........ $ 102,867 $ 172,757\n* Excludes shares held by pension funds of Berkshire subsidiaries.\n** This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis.\nCharlie and I do notview the $172.8 billion detailed above as a collection of ticker symbols – a financial\ndalliance to be terminated because of downgrades by “the Street,” expected Federal Reserve actions, possible politicaldevelopments, forecasts by economists or whatever else might be the subject du jour .\nWhat we see in our holdings, rather, is an assembly of companies that we partly own and that, on a weighted\nbasis, are earning about 20% on the net tangible equity capital required to run their businesses. These companies, also,\nearn their profits without employing excessive levels of debt.\n12\n\nReturns of that order by large, established and understandable businesses are remarkable under any\ncircumstances. They are truly mind-blowing when compared against the return that many investors have accepted onbonds over the last decade – 3% or less on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, for example.\nOn occasion, a ridiculously-high purchase price for a given stock will cause a splendid business to become a\npoor investment – if not permanently, at least for a painfully long period. Over time, however, investment performanceconverges with business performance. And, as I will next spell out, the record of American business has beenextraordinary.\nThe American Tailwind\nOn March 11\nth, it will be 77 years since I first invested in an American business. The year was 1942, I was\n11, and I went all in, investing $114.75 I had begun accumulating at age six. What I bought was three shares of CitiesService preferred stock. I had become a capitalist, and it felt good.\nLet’s now travel back through the two 77-year periods that preceded my purchase. That leaves us starting in\n1788, a year prior to George Washington’s installation as our first president. Could anyone then have imagined whattheir new country would accomplish in only three 77-year lifetimes?\nDuring the two 77-year periods prior to 1942, the United States had grown from four million people – about\n1⁄2of 1% of the world’s population – into the most powerful country on earth. In that spring of 1942, though, it faced\na crisis: The U.S. and its allies were suffering heavy losses in a war that we had entered only three months earlier. Badnews arrived daily.\nDespite the alarming headlines, almost all Americans believed on that March 11\nththat the war would be\nwon. Nor was their optimism limited to that victory. Leaving aside congenital pessimists, Americans believed thattheir children and generations beyond would live far better lives than they themselves had led.\nThe nation’s citizens understood, of course, that the road ahead would not be a smooth ride. It never had\nbeen. Early in its history our country was tested by a Civil War that killed 4% of all American males and led PresidentLincoln to openly ponder whether “a nation so conceived and so dedicated could long endure.” In the 1930s, Americasuffered through the Great Depression, a punishing period of massive unemployment.\nNevertheless, in 1942, when I made my purchase, the nation expected post-war growth, a belief that proved\nto be well-founded. In fact, the nation’s achievements can best be described as breathtaking.\nLet’s put numbers to that claim: If my $114.75 had been invested in a no-fee S&P 500 index fund, and all\ndividends had been reinvested, my stake would have grown to be worth (pre-taxes) $606,811 on January 31, 2019 (thelatest data available before the printing of this letter). That is a gain of 5,288 for 1. Meanwhile, a $1 million investment\nby a tax-free institution of that time – say, a pension fund or college endowment – would have grown to about $5.3billion .\nLet me add one additional calculation that I believe will shock you: If that hypothetical institution had paid\nonly 1%of assets annually to various “helpers,” such as investment managers and consultants, its gain would have\nbeen cut in half , to $2.65 billion. That’s what happens over 77 years when the 11.8% annual return actually achieved\nby the S&P 500 is recalculated at a 10.8% rate.\n13\n\nThose who regularly preach doom because of government budget deficits (as I regularly did myself for many\nyears) might note that our country’s national debt has increased roughly 400-fold during the last of my 77-year periods.That’s 40,000%! Suppose you had foreseen this increase and panicked at the prospect of runaway deficits and aworthless currency. To “protect” yourself, you might have eschewed stocks and opted instead to buy 3\n1⁄4ounces of\ngold with your $114.75.\nAnd what would that supposed protection have delivered? You would now have an asset worth about $4,200,\nless than 1% of what would have been realized from a simple unmanaged investment in American business. The\nmagical metal was no match for the American mettle.\nOur country’s almost unbelievable prosperity has been gained in a bipartisan manner. Since 1942, we have\nhad seven Republican presidents and seven Democrats. In the years they served, the country contended at various timeswith a long period of viral inflation, a 21% prime rate, several controversial and costly wars, the resignation of apresident, a pervasive collapse in home values, a paralyzing financial panic and a host of other problems. Allengendered scary headlines; all are now history.\nChristopher Wren, architect of St. Paul’s Cathedral, lies buried within that London church. Near his tomb are\nposted these words of description (translated from Latin): “If you would seek my monument, look around you.” Thoseskeptical of America’s economic playbook should heed his message.\nIn 1788 – to go back to our starting point – there really wasn’t much here except for a small band of ambitious\npeople and an embryonic governing framework aimed at turning their dreams into reality. Today, the Federal Reserveestimates our household wealth at $108 trillion , an amount almost impossible to comprehend.\nRemember, earlier in this letter, how I described retained earnings as having been the key to Berkshire’s\nprosperity? So it has been with America. In the nation’s accounting, the comparable item is labeled “savings.” Andsave we have. If our forefathers had instead consumed all they produced, there would have been no investment, noproductivity gains and no leap in living standards.\n************\nCharlie and I happily acknowledge that much of Berkshire’s success has simply been a product of what I\nthink should be called The American Tailwind . It is beyond arrogance for American businesses or individuals to boast\nthat they have “done it alone.” The tidy rows of simple white crosses at Normandy should shame those who makesuch claims.\nThere are also many other countries around the world that have bright futures. About that, we should rejoice:\nAmericans will be both more prosperous and safer if allnations thrive. At Berkshire, we hope to invest significant\nsums across borders.\nOver the next 77 years, however, the major source of our gains will almost certainly be provided by The\nAmerican Tailwind. We are lucky – gloriously lucky – to have that force at our back.\n14\n\nThe Annual Meeting\nBerkshire’s 2019 annual meeting will take place on Saturday, May 4th. If you are thinking about attending –\nand Charlie and I hope you come – check out the details on pages A-2 – A-3. They describe the same schedule we’vefollowed for some years.\nIf you can’t join us in Omaha, attend via Yahoo’s webcast. Andy Serwer and his Yahoo associates do an\noutstanding job, both in covering the entire meeting and interviewing many Berkshire managers, celebrities, financialexperts and shareholders from the U.S. and abroad. The world’s knowledge of what goes on in Omaha the firstSaturday of every May has grown dramatically since Yahoo came on board. Its coverage begins at 8:45 a.m. CDT andprovides Mandarin translation.\n************\nFor 54 years, Charlie and I have loved our jobs. Daily, we do what we find interesting, working with people\nwe like and trust. And now our new management structure has made our lives even more enjoyable.\nWith the whole ensemble – that is, with Ajit and Greg running operations, a great collection of businesses, a\nNiagara of cash-generation, a cadre of talented managers and a rock-solid culture – your company is in good shapefor whatever the future brings.\nFebruary 23, 2019 Warren E.

The components of that figure are $24 billion of operating earnings, $3.7 billion of realized capitalgains and a $53.7 billion gain from an increase in the amount of net unrealized capital gains that exist in the stocks\nwe hold. Each of those components of earnings is stated on an after-tax basis.\nThat $53.7 billion gain requires comment. It resulted from a new GAAP rule, imposed in 2018, that requires\na company holding equity securities to include in earnings the net change in the unrealized gains and losses of those\nsecurities. As we stated in last year’s letter, neither Charlie Munger, my partner in managing Berkshire, nor I agreewith that rule.\nThe adoption of the rule by the accounting profession, in fact, was a monumental shift in its own thinking.\nBefore 2018, GAAP insisted – with an exception for companies whose business was to trade securities – thatunrealized gains within a portfolio of stocks were never to be included in earnings and unrealized losses were to be\nincluded only if they were deemed “other than temporary.” Now, Berkshire must enshrine in each quarter’s bottom\nline – a key item of news for many investors, analysts and commentators – every up and down movement of the stocksit owns, however capricious those fluctuations may be.\nBerkshire’s 2018 and 2019 years glaringly illustrate the argument we have with the new rule. In 2018, a down\nyear for the stock market, our net unrealized gains decreased by $20.6 billion, and we therefore reported GAAP\nearnings of only $4 billion. In 2019, rising stock prices increased net unrealized gains by the aforementioned $53.7\nbillion, pushing GAAP earnings to the $81.4 billion reported at the beginning of this letter. Those market gyrationsled to a crazy 1,900% increase in GAAP earnings!\nMeanwhile, in what we might call the real world, as opposed to accounting-land, Berkshire’s equity holdings\naveraged about $200 billion during the two years, and the intrinsic value of the stocks we own grew steadily and\nsubstantially throughout the period.\nCharlie and I urge you to focus on operating earnings – which were little changed in 2019 – and to ignore\nboth quarterly and annual gains or losses from investments, whether these are realized or unrealized.\nOur advising that in no way diminishes the importance of these investments to Berkshire. Over time, Charlie\nand I expect our equity holdings – as a group – to deliver major gains, albeit in an unpredictable and highly irregular\nmanner. To see why we are optimistic, move on to the next discussion.\nThe Power of Retained Earnings\nIn 1924, Edgar Lawrence Smith, an obscure economist and financial advisor, wrote Common Stocks as Long\nTerm Investments , a slim book that changed the investment world. Indeed, writing the book changed Smith himself,\nforcing him to reassess his own investment beliefs.\nGoing in, he planned to argue that stocks would perform better than bonds during inflationary periods and\nthat bonds would deliver superior returns during deflationary times. That seemed sensible enough. But Smith was infor a shock.\n3\n\nHis book began, therefore, with a confession: “These studies are the record of a failure – the failure of facts\nto sustain a preconceived theory.” Luckily for investors, that failure led Smith to think more deeply about how stocksshould be evaluated.\nFor the crux of Smith’s insight, I will quote an early reviewer of his book, none other than John Maynard\nKeynes: “I have kept until last what is perhaps Mr. Smith’s most important, and is certainly his most novel, point.Well-managed industrial companies do not, as a rule, distribute to the shareholders the whole of their earned profits.In good years, if not in all years, they retain a part of their profits and put them back into the business. Thus there is\nan element of compound interest (Keynes’ italics) operating in favour of a sound industrial investment. Over a period\nof years, the real value of the property of a sound industrial is increasing at compound interest, quite apart from thedividends paid out to the shareholders.”\nAnd with that sprinkling of holy water, Smith was no longer obscure.It’s difficult to understand why retained earnings were unappreciated by investors before Smith’s book was\npublished. After all, it was no secret that mind-boggling wealth had earlier been amassed by such titans as Carnegie,Rockefeller and Ford, all of whom had retained a huge portion of their business earnings to fund growth and produceever-greater profits. Throughout America, also, there had long been small-time capitalists who became rich followingthe same playbook.\nNevertheless, when business ownership was sliced into small pieces – “stocks” – buyers in the pre-Smith\nyears usually thought of their shares as a short-term gamble on market movements. Even at their best, stocks wereconsidered speculations. Gentlemen preferred bonds.\nThough investors were slow to wise up, the math of retaining and reinvesting earnings is now well\nunderstood. Today, school children learn what Keynes termed “novel”: combining savings with compound interestworks wonders.\n************\nAt Berkshire, Charlie and I have long focused on using retained earnings advantageously. Sometimes this\njob has been easy – at other times, more than difficult, particularly when we began working with huge and ever-growing sums of money.\nIn our deployment of the funds we retain, we first seek to invest in the many and diverse businesses we\nalready own. During the past decade, Berkshire’s depreciation charges have aggregated $65 billion whereas thecompany’s internal investments in property, plant and equipment have totaled $121 billion. Reinvestment in\nproductive operational assets will forever remain our top priority.\nIn addition, we constantly seek to buy new businesses that meet three criteria. First, they must earn good\nreturns on the net tangible capital required in their operation. Second, they must be run by able and honest managers.Finally, they must be available at a sensible price.\nWhen we spot such businesses, our preference would be to buy 100% of them. But the opportunities to make\nmajor acquisitions possessing our required attributes are rare. Far more often, a fickle stock market serves upopportunities for us to buy large, but non-controlling , positions in publicly-traded companies that meet our standards.\nWhichever way we go – controlled companies or only a major stake by way of the stock market – Berkshire’s\nfinancial results from the commitment will in large part be determined by the future earnings of the business we havepurchased. Nonetheless, there is between the two investment approaches a hugely important accounting difference,essential for you to understand.\n4\n\nIn our controlled companies, (defined as those in which Berkshire owns more than 50% of the shares), the\nearnings of each business flow directly into the operating earnings that we report to you. What you see is what youget.\nIn the non-controlled companies, in which we own marketable stocks, only the dividends that Berkshire\nreceives are recorded in the operating earnings we report. The retained earnings? They’re working hard and creatingmuch added value, but notin a way that deposits those gains directly into Berkshire’s reported earnings.\nAt almost all major companies other than Berkshire, investors would notfind what we’ll call this “non-\nrecognition of earnings” important. For us, however, it is a standout omission, of a magnitude that we lay out for youbelow.\nHere, we list our 10 largest stock-market holdings of businesses. The list distinguishes between their earnings\nthat are reported to you under GAAP accounting – these are the dividends Berkshire receives from those 10 investees– and our share, so to speak, of the earnings the investees retain and put to work. Normally, those companies useretained earnings to expand their business and increase its efficiency. Or sometimes they use those funds to repurchasesignificant portions of their own stock, an act that enlarges Berkshire’s share of the company’s future earnings.\nYearend\nOwnership\nBerkshire’s Share (in millions)\nCompany Dividends(1) Retained Earnings(2)\nAmerican Express 18.7% $ 261 $ 998\nApple 5.7% 773 2,519Bank of America 10.7% 682 2,167Bank of New York Mellon 9.0% 101 288Coca-Cola 9.3% 640 194Delta Airlines 11.0% 114 416J.P.

Sometimes, alas, retentions produce nothing. But bothlogic and our past experience indicate that from the group we will realize capital gains at least equal to – and probably\nbetter than – the earnings of ours that they retained. (When we sell shares and realize gains, we will pay income tax onthe gain at whatever rate then prevails. Currently, the federal rate is 21%.)\nIt is certain that Berkshire’s rewards from these 10 companies, as well as those from our many other equity\nholdings, will manifest themselves in a highly irregular manner. Periodically, there will be losses, sometimescompany-specific, sometimes linked to stock-market swoons. At other times – last year was one of those – our gainwill be outsized. Overall, the retained earnings of our investees are certain to be of major importance in the growth of\nBerkshire’s value.\nMr. Smith got it right.\n5\n\nNon-Insurance Operations\nTom Murphy, a valued director of Berkshire and an all-time great among business managers, long ago gave\nme some important advice about acquisitions: “To achieve a reputation as a good manager, just be sure you buy goodbusinesses.”\nOver the years Berkshire has acquired many dozens of companies, all of which I initially regarded as “good\nbusinesses.” Some, however, proved disappointing; more than a few were outright disasters. A reasonable number, onthe other hand, have exceeded my hopes.\nIn reviewing my uneven record, I’ve concluded that acquisitions are similar to marriage: They start, of course,\nwith a joyful wedding – but then reality tends to diverge from pre-nuptial expectations. Sometimes, wonderfully, thenew union delivers bliss beyond either party’s hopes. In other cases, disillusionment is swift. Applying those imagesto corporate acquisitions, I’d have to say it is usually the buyer who encounters unpleasant surprises. It’s easy to getdreamy-eyed during corporate courtships.\nPursuing that analogy, I would say that our marital record remains largely acceptable, with all parties happy\nwith the decisions they made long ago. Some of our tie-ups have been positively idyllic. A meaningful number,however, have caused me all too quickly to wonder what I was thinking when I proposed.\nFortunately, the fallout from many of my errors has been reduced by a characteristic shared by most\nbusinesses that disappoint: As the years pass, the “poor” business tends to stagnate, thereupon entering a state in whichits operations require an ever-smaller percentage of Berkshire’s capital. Meanwhile, our “good” businesses often tend\nto grow and find opportunities for investing additional capital at attractive rates. Because of these contrastingtrajectories, the assets employed at Berkshire’s winners gradually become an expanding portion of our total capital.\nAs an extreme example of those financial movements, witness Berkshire’s original textile business. When\nwe acquired control of the company in early 1965, this beleaguered operation required nearly allof Berkshire’s capital.\nFor some time, therefore, Berkshire’s non-earning textile assets were a huge drag on our overall returns. Eventually,though, we acquired a spread of “good” businesses, a shift that by the early 1980s caused the dwindling textileoperation to employ only a tiny portion of our capital.\nToday, we have most of your money deployed in controlled businesses that achieve good-to-excellent returns\non the net tangible assets each requires for its operations. Our insurance business has been the superstar. That operationhas special characteristics that give it a unique metric for calibrating success, one unfamiliar to many investors. Wewill save that discussion for the next section.\nIn the paragraphs that follow, we group our wide array of non-insurance businesses by size of earnings, after\ninterest, depreciation, taxes, non-cash compensation, restructuring charges – all of those pesky, but very real, coststhat CEOs and Wall Street sometimes urge investors to ignore. Additional information about these operations can befound on pages K-6 – K-21 and pages K-40 – K-52.\nOur BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) – the two lead dogs of Berkshire’s non-\ninsurance group – earned a combined $8.3 billion in 2019 (including only our 91% share of BHE), an increase of 6%from 2018.\nOur next five non-insurance subsidiaries, as ranked by earnings (but presented here alphabetically), Clayton\nHomes, International Metalworking, Lubrizol, Marmon and Precision Castparts, had aggregate earnings in 2019 of$4.8 billion, little changed from what these companies earned in 2018.\nThe next five, similarly ranked and listed (Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Johns Manville, NetJets, Shaw\nand TTI) earned $1.9 billion last year, up from the $1.7 billion earned by this tier in 2018.\n6\n\nThe remaining non-insurance businesses that Berkshire owns – and there are many – had aggregate earnings\nof $2.7 billion in 2019, down from $2.8 billion in 2018.\nOur total net income in 2019 from the non-insurance businesses we control amounted to $17.7 billion, an\nincrease of 3% from the $17.2 billion this group earned in 2018. Acquisitions and dispositions had almost no net effecton these results.\n************\nI must add one final item that underscores the wide scope of Berkshire’s operations. Since 2011, we have\nowned Lubrizol, an Ohio-based company that produces and markets oil additives throughout the world. On September26, 2019, a fire originating at a small next-door operation spread to a large French plant owned by Lubrizol.\nThe result was significant property damage and a major disruption in Lubrizol’s business. Even so, both the\ncompany’s property loss and business-interruption loss will be mitigated by substantial insurance recoveries thatLubrizol will receive.\nBut, as the late Paul Harvey was given to saying in his famed radio broadcasts, “Here’s the rest of the story.”\nOne of the largest insurers of Lubrizol was a company owned b y...u h , Berkshire.\nIn Matthew 6:3, the Bible instructs us to “Let not the left hand know what the right hand doeth.” Your\nchairman has clearly behaved as ordered.\nProperty/Casualty Insurance\nOur property/casualty (“P/C”) insurance business has been the engine propelling Berkshire’s growth since\n1967, the year we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire & Marine, for $8.6 million.Today, National Indemnity is the largest P/C company in the world as measured by net worth. Insurance is a businessof promises, and Berkshire’s ability to honor its commitments is unmatched.\nOne reason we were attracted to the P/C business was the industry’s business model: P/C insurers receive\npremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos, or severeworkplace accidents, payments can stretch over many decades.\nThis collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums – money we call “float” – that\nwill eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their own benefit. Though individualpolicies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation topremium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how it has grown, as the following\ntable shows:\nYear\nFloat (in millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322018 122,7322019 129,423\nWe may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be very gradual – at the outside no more\nthan 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate or near-\nterm demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. That structure is by design and is a keycomponent in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. That strength will never be compromised.\n7\n\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers an\nunderwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy theuse of free money – and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\nFor the P/C industry as a whole, the financial value of float is now far less than it was for many years. That’s\nbecause the standard investment strategy for almost all P/C companies is heavily – and properly – skewed toward\nhigh-grade bonds. Changes in interest rates therefore matter enormously to these companies, and during the last decadethe bond market has offered pathetically low rates.\nConsequently, insurers suffered, as year by year they were forced – by maturities or issuer-call provisions –\nto recycle their “old” investment portfolios into new holdings providing much lower yields. Where once these insurerscould safely earn 5 cents or 6 cents on each dollar of float, they now take in only 2 cents or 3 cents (or even less iftheir operations are concentrated in countries mired in the never-never land of negative rates).\nSome insurers may try to mitigate their loss of revenue by buying lower-quality bonds or non-liquid\n“alternative” investments promising higher yields. But those are dangerous games and activities that most institutionsare ill-equipped to play.\nBerkshire’s situation is more favorable than that of insurers in general. Most important, our unrivaled\nmountain of capital, abundance of cash and a huge and diverse stream of non-insurance earnings allow us far moreinvestment flexibility than is generally available to other companies in the industry. The many choices open to us arealways advantageous – and sometimes have presented us with major opportunities.\nOur P/C companies have meanwhile had an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at an\nunderwriting profit for 16 of the last 17 years, the exception being 2017, when our pre-tax loss was a whopping $3.2billion. For the entire 17-year span, our pre-tax gain totaled $27.5 billion, of which $400 million was recorded in 2019.\nThat record is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of our insurance managers, who\nknow that the rewards of float can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service.At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.\nAs I have repeatedly done in the past, I will emphasize now that happy outcomes in insurance are far from a\nsure thing: We will most certainly not have an underwriting profit in 16 of the next 17 years. Danger always lurks.\nMistakes in assessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years – even decades – to surface and\nripen. (Think asbestos.) A major catastrophe that will dwarf hurricanes Katrina and Michael willoccur – perhaps\ntomorrow, perhaps many decades from now. “The Big One” may come from a traditional source, such as wind orearthquake, or it may be a total surprise involving, say, a cyber attack having disastrous consequences beyond anythinginsurers now contemplate. When such a mega-catastrophe strikes, Berkshire will get its share of the losses and theywill be big – very big. Unlike many other insurers, however, handling the loss will not come close to straining our\nresources, and we will be eager to addto our business the next day.\n** **********\nClose your eyes for a moment and try to envision a locale that might spawn a dynamic P/C insurer. New\nYork? London? Silicon Valley?\nHow about Wilkes-Barre?\n8\n\nLate in 2012, Ajit Jain, the invaluable manager of our insurance operations, called to tell me that he was\nbuying a tiny company – GUARD Insurance Group – in that small Pennsylvania city for $221 million (roughly its networth at the time). He added that Sy Foguel, GUARD’s CEO, was going to be a star at Berkshire. Both GUARD andSy were new names to me.\nBingo and bingo: In 2019, GUARD had premium volume of $1.9 billion, up 379% since 2012, and also\ndelivered a satisfactory underwriting profit. Since joining Berkshire, Sy has led the company into both new productsand new regions of the country and has increased GUARD’s float by 265%.\nIn 1967, Omaha seemed an unlikely launching pad for a P/C giant. Wilkes-Barre may well deliver a similar\nsurprise.\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy is now celebrating its 20\nthyear under our ownership. That anniversary suggests\nthat we should be catching up with the company’s accomplishments.\nWe’ll start with the topic of electricity rates. When Berkshire entered the utility business in 2000, purchasing\n76% of BHE, the company’s residential customers in Iowa paid an average of 8.8 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh).Prices for residential customers have since risen less than 1% a year, and we have promised that there will be no baserate price increases through 2028. In contrast, here’s what is happening at the other large investor-owned Iowa utility:Last year, the rates it charged its residential customers were 61% higher than BHE’s. Recently, that utility received arate increase that will widen the gap to 70%.\nThe extraordinary differential between our rates and theirs is largely the result of our huge accomplishments\nin converting wind into electricity. In 2021, we expect BHE’s operation to generate about 25.2 million megawatt-hoursof electricity (MWh) in Iowa from wind turbines that it both owns and operates. That output will totally cover theannual needs of its Iowa customers, which run to about 24.6 million MWh. In other words, our utility will have attainedwind self-sufficiency in the state of Iowa.\nIn still another contrast, that other Iowa utility generates less than 10% of its power from wind. Furthermore,\nwe know of no other investor-owned utility, wherever located, that by 2021 will have achieved a position of windself-sufficiency. In 2000, BHE was serving an agricultural-based economy; today, three of its five largest customersare high-tech giants. I believe their decisions to site plants in Iowa were in part based upon BHE’s ability to deliverrenewable, low-cost energy.\nOf course, wind is intermittent, and our blades in Iowa turn only part of the time. In certain periods, when\nthe air is still, we look to our non-wind generating capacity to secure the electricity we need. At opposite times, wesell the excess power that wind provides us to other utilities, serving them through what’s called “the grid.” The powerwe sell them supplants their need for a carbon resource – coal, say, or natural gas.\nBerkshire Hathaway now owns 91% of BHE in partnership with Walter Scott, Jr. and Greg Abel. BHE has\nnever paid Berkshire Hathaway a dividend since our purchase and has, as the years have passed, retained $28 billionof earnings. That pattern is an outlier in the world of utilities, whose companies customarily pay big dividends –sometimes reaching, or even exceeding, 80% of earnings. Our view: The more we can invest, the more we like it.\nToday, BHE has the operating talent and experience to manage truly huge utility projects – requiring\ninvestments of $100 billion or more – that could support infrastructure benefitting our country, our communities andour shareholders. We stand ready, willing and able to take on such opportunities.\n9\n\nInvestments\nBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value. We exclude\nour Kraft Heinz holding – 325,442,152 shares – because Berkshire is part of a control group and therefore mustaccount for this investment on the “equity” method. On its balance sheet, Berkshire carries the Kraft Heinz holding ata GAAP figure of $13.8 billion, an amount that represents Berkshire’s share of the audited net worth of Kraft Heinzat December 31, 2019. Please note, though, that the market value of our shares on that date was only $10.5 billion.\n12/31/19\nShares*\nCompanyPercentage of\nCompany\nOwned Cost** Market\n(in millions)\n151,610,700 American Express Company .................. 18.7 $ 1,287 $ 18,874\n250,866,566 Apple Inc. ................................ 5 . 7 35,287 73,667\n947,760,000 Bank of America Corp. ...................... 10.7 12,560 33,380\n81,488,751 The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. ........... 9 . 0 3,696 4,101\n5,426,609 Charter Communications, Inc. ................ 2 . 6 9 4 4 2,632\n400,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company .................... 9 . 3 1,299 22,140\n70,910,456 Delta Air Lines, Inc. ........................ 11.0 3,125 4,147\n12,435,814 The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. ............... 3 . 5 8 9 0 2,859\n60,059,932 JPMorgan Chase & Co. ...................... 1 . 9 6,556 8,372\n24,669,778 Moody’s Corporation ....................... 13.1 248 5,857\n46,692,713 Southwest Airlines Co. ...................... 9 . 0 1,940 2,520\n21,938,642 United Continental Holdings Inc. .............. 8 . 7 1,195 1,933\n149,497,786 U.S. Bancorp .............................. 9 . 7 5,709 8,864\n10,239,160 Visa Inc. ................................. 0 . 6 3 4 9 1,924\n345,688,918 Wells Fargo & Company ..................... 8 . 4 7,040 18,598\nOthers*** ................................ 28,215 38,159\nTotal Equity Investments Carried at Market ...... $110,340 $248,027\n* Excludes shares held by pension funds of Berkshire subsidiaries.\n** This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis.*** Includes $10 billion investment in Occidental Petroleum Corporation consisting of preferred stock and\nwarrants to buy common stock.\nCharlie and I do notview the $248 billion detailed above as a collection of stock market wagers – dalliances\nto be terminated because of downgrades by “the Street,” an earnings “miss,” expected Federal Reserve actions,possible political developments, forecasts by economists or whatever else might be the subject du jour .\nWhat we see in our holdings, rather, is an assembly of companies that we partly own and that, on a weighted\nbasis, are earning more than 20% on the net tangible equity capital required to run their businesses. These companies,\nalso, earn their profits without employing excessive levels of debt.\nReturns of that order by large, established and understandable businesses are remarkable under any\ncircumstances. They are truly mind-blowing when compared to the returns that many investors have accepted onbonds over the last decade – 2\n1⁄2% or even less on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, for example.\n10\n\nForecasting interest rates has never been our game, and Charlie and I have noidea what rates will average\nover the next year, or ten or thirty years. Our perhaps jaundiced view is that the pundits who opine on these subjectsreveal, by that very behavior, far more about themselves than they reveal about the future.\nWhat we cansay is that ifsomething close to current rates should prevail over the coming decades and if\ncorporate tax rates also remain near the low level businesses now enjoy, it is almost certain that equities will over time\nperform far better than long-term, fixed-rate debt instruments.\nThat rosy prediction comes with a warning: Anything can happen to stock prices tomorrow. Occasionally,\nthere will be major drops in the market, perhaps of 50% magnitude or even greater. But the combination of TheAmerican Tailwind, about which I wrote last year, and the compounding wonders described by Mr. Smith, will makeequities the much better long-term choice for the individual who does not use borrowed money and who can controlhis or her emotions. Others? Beware!\nThe Road Ahead\nThree decades ago, my Midwestern friend, Joe Rosenfield, then in his 80s, received an irritating letter from\nhis local newspaper. In blunt words, the paper asked for biographical data it planned to use in Joe’s obituary. Joedidn’t respond. So? A month later, he got a second letter from the paper, this one labeled “URGENT.”\nCharlie and I long ago entered the urgent zone. That’s not exactly great news for us. But Berkshire\nshareholders need not worry: Your company is 100% prepared for our departure.\nThe two of us base our optimism upon five factors. First, Berkshire’s assets are deployed in an extraordinary\nvariety of wholly or partly-owned businesses that, averaged out, earn attractive returns on the capital they use. Second,Berkshire’s positioning of its “controlled” businesses within a single entity endows it with some important andenduring economic advantages. Third, Berkshire’s financial affairs will unfailingly be managed in a manner allowingthe company to withstand external shocks of an extreme nature. Fourth, we possess skilled and devoted top managers\nfor whom running Berkshire is far more than simply having a high-paying and/or prestigious job. Finally, Berkshire’sdirectors – your guardians – are constantly focused on both the welfare of owners and the nurturing of a culture thatis rare among giant corporations. (The value of this culture is explored in Margin of Trust , a new book by Larry\nCunningham and Stephanie Cuba that will be available at our annual meeting.)\nCharlie and I have very pragmatic reasons for wanting to assure Berkshire’s prosperity in the years following\nour exit: The Mungers have Berkshire holdings that dwarf any of the family’s other investments, and I have a full 99%of my net worth lodged in Berkshire stock. I have never sold any shares and have no plans to do so. My only disposalof Berkshire shares, aside from charitable donations and minor personal gifts, took place in 1980, when I, along withother Berkshire stockholders who elected to participate, exchanged some of our Berkshire shares for the shares of anIllinois bank that Berkshire had purchased in 1969 and that, in 1980, needed to be offloaded because of changes in thebank holding company law.\nToday, my will specifically directs its executors – as well as the trustees who will succeed them in\nadministering my estate after the will is closed – not to sell anyBerkshire shares. My will also absolves both the\nexecutors and the trustees from liability for maintaining what obviously will be an extreme concentration of assets.\nThe will goes on to instruct the executors – and, in time, the trustees – to each year convert a portion of my\nA shares into B shares and then distribute the Bs to various foundations. Those foundations will be required to deploytheir grants promptly. In all, I estimate that it will take 12 to 15 years for the entirety of the Berkshire shares I hold atmy death to move into the market.\nAbsent my will’s directive that all my Berkshire shares should be held until their scheduled distribution dates,\nthe “safe” course for both my executors and trustees would be to sell the Berkshire shares under their temporarycontrol and reinvest the proceeds in U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities matching the scheduled dates fordistributions. That strategy would leave the fiduciaries immune from both public criticism and the possibility ofpersonal liability for failure to act in accordance with the “prudent man” standard.\n11\n\nI myself feel comfortable that Berkshire shares will provide a safe and rewarding investment during the\ndisposal period. There is always a chance – unlikely, but not negligible – that events will prove me wrong. I believe,however, that there is a high probability that my directive will deliver substantially greater resources to society thanwould result from a conventional course of action.\nKey to my “Berkshire-only” instructions is my faith in the future judgment and fidelity of Berkshire directors.\nThey will regularly be tested by Wall Streeters bearing fees. At many companies, these super-salesmen might win. Ido not, however, expect that to happen at Berkshire.\nBoards of Directors\nIn recent years, both the composition of corporate boards and their purpose have become hot topics. Once,\ndebate about the responsibilities of boards was largely limited to lawyers; today, institutional investors and politicianshave weighed in as well.\nMy credentials for discussing corporate governance include the fact that, over the last 62 years, I have served\nas a director of 21 publicly-owned companies (listed below). In all but two of them, I have represented a substantialholding of stock. In a few cases, I have tried to implement important change.\nDuring the first 30 or so years of my services, it was rare to find a woman in the room unless she represented\na family controlling the enterprise. This year, it should be noted, marks the 100\nthanniversary of the 19thAmendment,\nwhich guaranteed American women the right to have their voices heard in a voting booth. Their attaining similar statusin a board room remains a work in progress.\nOver the years, many new rules and guidelines pertaining to board composition and duties have come into\nbeing. The bedrock challenge for directors, nevertheless, remains constant: Find and retain a talented CEO –possessing integrity, for sure – who will be devoted to the company for his/her business lifetime. Often, that task is\nhard. When directors get it right, though, they need to do little else. But when they mess it up ,......\nAudit committees now work much harder than they once did and almost always view the job with appropriate\nseriousness. Nevertheless, these committees remain no match for managers who wish to game numbers, an offensethat has been encouraged by the scourge of earnings “guidance” and the desire of CEOs to “hit the number.” My directexperience (limited, thankfully) with CEOs who have played with a company’s numbers indicates that they were moreoften prompted by ego than by a desire for financial gain.\nCompensation committees now rely much more heavily on consultants than they used to. Consequently,\ncompensation arrangements have become more complicated – what committee member wants to explain paying largefees year after year for a simple plan? – and the reading of proxy material has become a mind-numbing experience.\nOne very important improvement in corporate governance has been mandated: a regularly-scheduled\n“executive session” of directors at which the CEO is barred. Prior to that change, truly frank discussions of a CEO’sskills, acquisition decisions and compensation were rare.\nAcquisition proposals remain a particularly vexing problem for board members. The legal orchestration for\nmaking deals has been refined and expanded (a word aptly describing attendant costs as well). But I have yet to see aCEO who craves an acquisition bring in an informed and articulate critic to argue against it. And yes, include meamong the guilty.\nBerkshire, Blue Chip Stamps, Cap Cities-ABC, Coca-Cola, Data Documents, Dempster, General Growth, Gillette,Kraft Heinz, Maracaibo Oil, Munsingwear, Omaha National Bank, Pinkerton’s, Portland Gas Light, Salomon,Sanborn Map, Tribune Oil, U.S. Air, Vornado, Washington Post, Wesco Financial\n12\n\nOverall, the deck is stacked in favor of the deal that’s coveted by the CEO and his/her obliging staff. It would\nbe an interesting exercise for a company to hire two “expert” acquisition advisors, one pro and one con, to deliver hisor her views on a proposed deal to the board – with the winning advisor to receive, say, ten times a token sum paid tothe loser. Don’t hold your breath awaiting this reform: The current system, whatever its shortcomings for shareholders,works magnificently for CEOs and the many advisors and other professionals who feast on deals. A venerable cautionwill forever be true when advice from Wall Street is contemplated: Don’t ask the barber whether you need a haircut.\nOver the years, board “independence” has become a new area of emphasis. One key point relating to this\ntopic, though, is almost invariably overlooked: Director compensation has now soared to a level that inevitably makespay a subconscious factor affecting the behavior of many non-wealthy members. Think, for a moment, of the directorearning $250,000-300,000 for board meetings consuming a pleasant couple of days six or so times a year. Frequently,the possession of one such directorship bestows on its holder three to four times the annual median income of U.S.\nhouseholds. (I missed much of this gravy train: As a director of Portland Gas Light in the early 1960s, I received $100annually for my service. To earn this princely sum, I commuted to Maine four times a year.)\nAnd job security now? It’s fabulous. Board members may get politely ignored, but they seldom get fired.\nInstead, generous age limits – usually 70 or higher – act as the standard method for the genteel ejection of directors.\nIs it any wonder that a non-wealthy director (“NWD”) now hopes – or even yearns – to be asked to join a\nsecond board, thereby vaulting into the $500,000-600,000 class? To achieve this goal, the NWD will need help. TheCEO of a company searching for board members will almost certainly check with the NWD’s current CEO as towhether NWD is a “good” director. “Good,” of course, is a code word. If the NWD has seriously challenged his/herpresent CEO’s compensation or acquisition dreams, his or her candidacy will silently die. When seeking directors,CEOs don’t look for pit bulls. It’s the cocker spaniel that gets taken home.\nDespite the illogic of it all, the director for whom fees are important – indeed, craved – is almost universally\nclassified as “independent” while many directors possessing fortunes very substantially linked to the welfare of thecorporation are deemed lacking in independence. Not long ago, I looked at the proxy material of a large Americancompany and found that eight directors had never purchased a share of the company’s stock using their own money .\n(They, of course, had received grants of stock as a supplement to their generous cash compensation.) This particular\ncompany had long been a laggard, but the directors were doing wonderfully.\nPaid-with-my-own-money ownership, of course, does notcreate wisdom or ensure business smarts.\nNevertheless, I feel better when directors of our portfolio companies have had the experience of purchasing shareswith their savings, rather than simply having been the recipients of grants.\n************\nHere, a pause is due: I’d like you to know that almost all of the directors I have met over the years have been\ndecent, likable and intelligent. They dressed well, made good neighbors and were fine citizens. I’ve enjoyed theircompany. Among the group are some men and women that I would not have met except for our mutual board serviceand who have become close friends.\nNevertheless, many of these good souls are people whom I would never have chosen to handle money or\nbusiness matters. It simply was not their game.\nThey, in turn, would never have asked me for help in removing a tooth, decorating their home or improving\ntheir golf swing. Moreover, if I were ever scheduled to appear on Dancing With the Stars , I would immediately seek\nrefuge in the Witness Protection Program. We are all duds at one thing or another. For most of us, the list is long. Theimportant point to recognize is that if you are Bobby Fischer, you must play only chess for money.\nAt Berkshire, we will continue to look for business-savvy directors who are owner-oriented and arrive with\na strong specific interest in our company. Thought and principles, not robot-like “process,” will guide their actions.In representing your interests, they will, of course, seek managers whose goals include delighting their customers,\ncherishing their associates and acting as good citizens of both their communities and our country.\n13\n\nThose objectives are not new. They were the goals of able CEOs sixty years ago and remain so. Who would\nhave it otherwise?\nShort Subjects\nIn past reports, we’ve discussed both the sense and nonsense of stock repurchases. Our thinking, boiled down:\nBerkshire will buy back its stock only if a) Charlie and I believe that it is selling for less than it is worth and b) thecompany, upon completing the repurchase, is left with ample cash.\nCalculations of intrinsic value are far from precise. Consequently, neither of us feels any urgency to buy an\nestimated $1 of value for a very real 95 cents. In 2019, the Berkshire price/value equation was modestly favorable at\ntimes, and we spent $5 billion in repurchasing about 1% of the company.\nOver time, we want Berkshire’s share count to go down . If the price-to-value discount (as we estimate it)\nwidens, we will likely become more aggressive in purchasing shares. We will not, however, prop the stock at anylevel.\nShareholders having at least $20 million in value of A or B shares and an inclination to sell shares to Berkshire\nmay wish to have their broker contact Berkshire’s Mark Millard at 402-346-1400. We request that you phone Markbetween 8:00-8:30 a.m. or 3:00-3:30 p.m. Central Time, calling only if you are ready to sell.\n************\nIn 2019, Berkshire sent $3.6 billion to the U.S. Treasury to pay its current income tax. The U.S. government\ncollected $243 billion from corporate income tax payments during the same period. From these statistics, you can takepride that your company delivered 1\n1⁄2% of the federal income taxes paid by allof corporate America.\nFifty-five years ago, when Berkshire entered its current incarnation, the company paid nothing in federal\nincome tax. (For good reason, too: Over the previous decade, the struggling business had recorded a net loss.) Sincethen, as Berkshire retained nearly all of its earnings, the beneficiaries of that policy became not only the company’sshareholders but also the federal government. In most future years, we both hope and expect to send farlarger sums\nto the Treasury.\n************\nOn pages A-2 – A-3, you will find details about our annual meeting, which will be held on May 2, 2020.\nYahoo, as usual, will be streaming the event worldwide. There will be one important change, however, in our format:I’ve had suggestions from shareholders, media and board members that Ajit Jain and Greg Abel – our two keyoperating managers – be given more exposure at the meeting. That change makes great sense. They are outstandingindividuals, both as managers and as human beings, and you should hear more from them.\nShareholders who this year send a question to be asked by our three long-serving journalists may specify that\nit be posed to Ajit or Greg. They, like Charlie and me, will not have even a hint of what the questions will be.\nThe journalists will alternate questions with those from the audience, who also can direct questions to any of\nthe four of us. So polish up your zingers.\n************\nOn May 2\nnd, come to Omaha. Meet your fellow capitalists. Buy some Berkshire products. Have fun. Charlie\nand I – along with the entire Berkshire gang – are looking forward to seeing you.\nFebruary 22, 2020 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board\n14",

The four components of that figure are $21.9 billion of operating earnings, $4.9 billion of realizedcapital gains, a $26.7 billion gain from an increase in the amount of net unrealized capital gains that exist in the stocks\nwe hold and, finally, an $11 billion lossfrom a write-down in the value of a few subsidiary and affiliate businesses\nthat we own. All items are stated on an after-tax basis.\nOperating earnings are what count most, even during periods when they are notthe largest item in our GAAP\ntotal. Our focus at Berkshire is both to increase this segment of our income and to acquire large and favorably-situatedbusinesses. Last year, however, we met neither goal: Berkshire made no sizable acquisitions and operating earningsfell9%. We did, though, increase Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic value by both retaining earnings and repurchasing\nabout 5% of our shares.\nThe two GAAP components pertaining to capital gains or losses (whether realized or unrealized) fluctuate\ncapriciously from year to year, reflecting swings in the stock market. Whatever today’s figures, Charlie Munger, my\nlong-time partner, and I firmly believe that, over time, Berkshire’s capital gains from its investment holdings will besubstantial.\nAs I’ve emphasized many times, Charlie and I view Berkshire’s holdings of marketable stocks – at yearend\nworth $281 billion – as a collection of businesses . We don’t control the operations of those companies, but we do\nshare proportionately in their long-term prosperity. From an accounting standpoint, however, our portion of theirearnings isnotincluded in Berkshire’s income. Instead, only what these investees pay us in dividends is recorded on\nour books. Under GAAP, the huge sums that investees retain on our behalf become invisible.\nWhat’s out of sight, however, should notbe out of mind: Those unrecorded retained earnings are usually\nbuilding value – lotsof value – for Berkshire. Investees use the withheld funds to expand their business, make\nacquisitions, pay off debt and, often, to repurchase their stock (an act that increases our share of their future earnings).As we pointed out in these pages last year, retained earnings have propelled American business throughout ourcountry’s history. What worked for Carnegie and Rockefeller has, over the years, worked its magic for millions ofshareholders as well.\nOf course, some of our investees will disappoint, adding little, if anything, to the value of their company by\nretaining earnings. But others will over-deliver, a few spectacularly. In aggregate, we expect our share of the hugepile of earnings retained by Berkshire’s non-controlled businesses (what others would label our equity portfolio) toeventually deliver us an equal or greater amount of capital gains. Over our 56-year tenure, that expectation has beenmet.\n3\n\nThe final component in our GAAP figure – that ugly $11 billion write-down – is almost entirely the\nquantification of a mistake I made in 2016. That year, Berkshire purchased Precision Castparts (“PCC”), and I paidtoo much for the company.\nNo one misled me in any way – I was simply too optimistic about PCC’s normalized profit potential. Last\nyear, my miscalculation was laid bare by adverse developments throughout the aerospace industry, PCC’s mostimportant source of customers.\nIn purchasing PCC, Berkshire bought a fine company – the best in its business. Mark Donegan, PCC’s CEO,\nis a passionate manager who consistently pours the same energy into the business that he did before we purchased it.We are lucky to have him running things.\nI believe I was right in concluding that PCC would, over time, earn good returns on the net tangible assets\ndeployed in its operations. I was wrong, however, in judging the average amount of future earnings and, consequently,\nwrong in my calculation of the proper price to pay for the business.\nPCC is far from my first error of that sort. But it’s a big one.\nTwo Strings to Our Bow\nBerkshire is often labeled a conglomerate, a negative term applied to holding companies that own a\nhodge-podge of unrelated businesses. And, yes, that describes Berkshire – but only in part. To understand how andwhy we differ from the prototype conglomerate, let’s review a little history.\nOver time, conglomerates have generally limited themselves to buying businesses in their entirety . That\nstrategy, however, came with two major problems. One was unsolvable: Most of the truly great businesses had nointerest in having anyone take them over. Consequently, deal-hungry conglomerateurs had to focus on so-so\ncompanies that lacked important and durable competitive strengths. That was not a great pond in which to fish.\nBeyond that, as conglomerateurs dipped into this universe of mediocre businesses, they often found\nthemselves required to pay staggering “control” premiums to snare their quarry. Aspiring conglomerateurs knew theanswer to this “overpayment” problem: They simply needed to manufacture a vastly overvalued stock of their ownthat could be used as a “currency” for pricey acquisitions. (“I’ll pay you $10,000 for your dog by giving you two ofmy $5,000 cats.”)\nOften, the tools for fostering the overvaluation of a conglomerate’s stock involved promotional techniques\nand “imaginative” accounting maneuvers that were, at best, deceptive and that sometimes crossed the line into fraud.When these tricks were “successful,” the conglomerate pushed its own stock to, say, 3x its business value in order tooffer the target 2x itsvalue.\nInvesting illusions can continue for a surprisingly long time. Wall Street loves the fees that deal-making\ngenerates, and the press loves the stories that colorful promoters provide. At a point, also, the soaring price of apromoted stock can itself become the “proof” that an illusion is reality.\n4\n\nEventually, of course, the party ends, and many business “emperors” are found to have no clothes. Financial\nhistory is replete with the names of famous conglomerateurs who were initially lionized as business geniuses byjournalists, analysts and investment bankers, but whose creations ended up as business junkyards.\nConglomerates earned their terrible reputation.\n************\nCharlie and I want our conglomerate to ownall or part of a diverse group of businesses with good economic\ncharacteristics and good managers. Whether Berkshire controls these businesses, however, is unimportant to us.\nIt took me a while to wise up. But Charlie – and also my 20-year struggle with the textile operation I inherited\nat Berkshire – finally convinced me that owning a non-controlling portion of a wonderful business is more profitable,more enjoyable and farless work than struggling with 100% of a marginal enterprise.\nFor those reasons, ourconglomerate will remain a collection of controlled andnon-controlled businesses.\nCharlie and I will simply deploy your capital into whatever we believe makes the most sense, based on a company’sdurable competitive strengths, the capabilities and character of its management, and price.\nIf that strategy requires little or no effort on our part, so much the better. In contrast to the scoring system\nutilized in diving competitions, you are awarded nopoints in business endeavors for “degree of difficulty.”\nFurthermore, as Ronald Reagan cautioned: “It’s said that hard work never killed anyone, but Isay why take the\nchance?”\nThe Family Jewels and How We Increase Your Share of These Gems\nOn page A-1 we list Berkshire’s subsidiaries, a smorgasbord of businesses employing 360,000 at yearend.\nYou can read much more about these controlled operations in the 10-K that fills the back part of this report. Our majorpositions in companies that we partly own and don’t control are listed on page 7 of this letter. That portfolio of\nbusinesses, too, is large and diverse.\nMost of Berkshire’s value, however, resides in four businesses, three controlled and one in which we have\nonly a 5.4% interest. All four are jewels.\nThe largest in value is our property/casualty insurance operation, which for 53 years has been the core of\nBerkshire. Our family of insurers is unique in the insurance field. So, too, is its manager, Ajit Jain, who joinedBerkshire in 1986.\nOverall, the insurance fleet operates with farmore capital than is deployed by any of its competitors\nworldwide. That financial strength, coupled with the huge flow of cash Berkshire annually receives from its\nnon-insurance businesses, allows our insurance companies to safely follow an equity-heavy investment strategy not\nfeasible for the overwhelming majority of insurers. Those competitors, for both regulatory and credit-rating reasons,must focus on bonds.\nAnd bonds are not the place to be these days. Can you believe that the income recently available from a\n10-year U.S. Treasury bond – the yield was 0.93% at yearend – had fallen 94% from the 15.8% yield available in\nSeptember 1981? In certain large and important countries, such as Germany and Japan, investors earn a negative return\non trillions of dollars of sovereign debt. Fixed-income investors worldwide – whether pension funds, insurancecompanies or retirees – face a bleak future.\n5\n\nSome insurers, as well as other bond investors, may try to juice the pathetic returns now available by shifting\ntheir purchases to obligations backed by shaky borrowers. Risky loans, however, are notthe answer to inadequate\ninterest rates. Three decades ago, the once-mighty savings and loan industry destroyed itself, partly by ignoring thatmaxim.\nBerkshire now enjoys $138 billion of insurance “float” – funds that do not belong to us, but are nevertheless\nours to deploy, whether in bonds, stocks or cash equivalents such as U.S. Treasury bills. Float has some similaritiesto bank deposits: cash flows in and out daily to insurers, with the total they hold changing very little. The massivesum held by Berkshire is likely to remain near its present level for many years and, on a cumulative basis, has beencostless to us. That happy result, of course, could change – but, over time, I like our odds.\nI have repetitiously – some might say endlessly – explained our insurance operation in my annual letters to\nyou. Therefore, I will this year ask new shareholders who wish to learn more about our insurance business and “float”to read the pertinent section of the 2019 report, reprinted on page A-2. It’s important that you understand the risks,as well as the opportunities, existing in our insurance activities.\nOur second and third most valuable assets – it’s pretty much a toss-up at this point – are Berkshire’s 100%\nownership of BNSF, America’s largest railroad measured by freight volume, and our 5.4% ownership of Apple. Andin the fourth spot is our 91% ownership of Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”). What we have here is a very unusualutility business, whose annual earnings have grown from $122 million to $3.4 billion during our 21 years of ownership.\nI’ll have more to say about BNSF and BHE later in this letter. For now, however, I would like to focus on a\npractice Berkshire will periodically use to enhance your interest in both its “Big Four” as well as the many other assets\nBerkshire owns.\n************\nLast year we demonstrated our enthusiasm for Berkshire’s spread of properties by repurchasing the\nequivalent of 80,998 “A” shares, spending $24.7 billion in the process. That action increased your ownership in allof\nBerkshire’s businesses by 5.2% without requiring you to so much as touch your wallet.\nFollowing criteria Charlie and I have long recommended, we made those purchases because we believed they\nwould both enhance the intrinsic value per share for continuing shareholders andwould leave Berkshire with more\nthan ample funds for any opportunities or problems it might encounter.\nIn no way do we think that Berkshire shares should be repurchased at simply any price. I emphasize that\npoint because American CEOs have an embarrassing record of devoting more company funds to repurchases whenprices have risen than when they have tanked. Our approach is exactly the reverse.\nBerkshire’s investment in Apple vividly illustrates the power of repurchases. We began buying Apple stock\nlate in 2016 and by early July 2018, owned slightly more than one billion Apple shares (split-adjusted). Saying that,I’m referencing the investment held in Berkshire’s general account and am excluding a very small andseparately-managed holding of Apple shares that was subsequently sold. When we finished our purchases inmid-2018, Berkshire’s general account owned 5.2% of Apple.\nOur cost for that stake was $36 billion. Since then, we have both enjoyed regular dividends, averaging about\n$775 million annually, and have also – in 2020 – pocketed an additional $11 billion by selling a small portion of ourposition.\nDespite that sale – voila! – Berkshire now owns 5.4% of Apple. That increase was costless to us, coming\nabout because Apple has continuously repurchased its shares, thereby substantially shrinking the number it now hasoutstanding.\n6\n\nBut that’s far from all of the good news. Because we also repurchased Berkshire shares during the 21⁄2years,\nyounow indirectly own a full 10% more of Apple’s assets and future earnings than you did in July 2018.\nThis agreeable dynamic continues. Berkshire has repurchased more shares since yearend and is likely to\nfurther reduce its share count in the future. Apple has publicly stated an intention to repurchase its shares as well. Asthese reductions occur, Berkshire shareholders will not only own a greater interest in our insurance group and in BNSFand BHE, but will also find their indirect ownership of Apple increasing as well.\nThe math of repurchases grinds away slowly, but can be powerful over time. The process offers a simple way\nfor investors to own an ever-expanding portion of exceptional businesses.\nAnd as a sultry Mae West assured us: “Too much of a good thing can be . . . wonderful.”\nInvestments\nBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend were our largest in market value. We\nexclude our Kraft Heinz holding — 325,442,152 shares — because Berkshire is part of a control group and thereforemust account for that investment using the “equity” method. On its balance sheet, Berkshire carries the Kraft Heinzholding at a GAAP figure of $13.3 billion, an amount that represents Berkshire’s share of the audited net worth ofKraft Heinz on December 31, 2020. Please note, though, that the market value of our shares on that date was only$11.3 billion.\n12/31/20\nShares*\nCompanyPercentage of\nCompany\nOwned Cost** Market\n(in millions)\n25,533,082 AbbVie Inc. ............................... 1 . 4 $ 2,333 $ 2,736\n151,610,700 American Express Company .................. 18.8 1,287 18,331\n907,559,761 Apple Inc. ................................. 5 . 4 31,089 120,424\n1,032,852,006 Bank of America Corp. ...................... 11.9 14,631 31,306\n66,835,615 The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. ........... 7 . 5 2,918 2,837\n225,000,000 BYD Co.

Since our country’s birth, individuals with an idea, ambition\nand often just a pittance of capital have succeeded beyond their dreams by creating something new or by improvingthe customer’s experience with something old.\nCharlie and I journeyed throughout the nation to join with many of these individuals or their families. On the\nWest Coast, we began the routine in 1972 with our purchase of See’s Candy. A full century ago, Mary See set out todeliver an age-old product that she had reinvented with special recipes. Added to her business plan were quaint storesstaffed by friendly salespeople. Her first small outlet in Los Angeles eventually led to several hundred shops, spreadthroughout the West.\nToday, Mrs. See’s creations continue to delight customers while providing life-long employment for\nthousands of women and men. Berkshire’s job is simply not to meddle with the company’s success. When a businessmanufactures and distributes a non-essential consumer product, the customer is the boss. And, after 100 years, the\ncustomer’s message to Berkshire remains clear: “Don’t mess with mycandy.” (The website is https://www.sees.com/;\ntry the peanut brittle.)\nLet’s move across the continent to Washington, D.C. In 1936, Leo Goodwin, along with his wife, Lillian,\nbecame convinced that auto insurance – a standardized product customarily purchased from agents – could be solddirectly at a much lower price. Armed with $100,000, the pair took on giant insurers possessing 1,000 times or moretheir capital. Government Employees Insurance Company (later shortened to GEICO) was on its way.\nBy luck, I was exposed to the company’s potential a full 70 years ago. It instantly became my first love (of\nan investment sort). You know the rest of the story: Berkshire eventually became the 100% owner of GEICO, whichat 84 years of age is constantly fine-tuning – but not changing – the vision of Leo and Lillian.\nThere has been, however, a change in the company’s size. In 1937, its first full year of operation, GEICO did\n$238,288 of business. Last year the figure was $35 billion.\n************\nToday, with much of finance, media, government and tech located in coastal areas, it’s easy to overlook the\nmany miracles occurring in middle America. Let’s focus on two communities that provide stunning illustrations ofthe talent and ambition existing throughout our country.\nYou will not be surprised that I begin with Omaha.In 1940, Jack Ringwalt, a graduate of Omaha’s Central High School (the alma mater as well of Charlie, my\ndad, my first wife, our three children and two grandchildren), decided to start a property/casualty insurance companyfunded by $125,000 in capital.\nJack’s dream was preposterous, requiring his pipsqueak operation – somewhat pompously christened as\nNational Indemnity – to compete with giant insurers, all of which operated with abundant capital. Additionally, thosecompetitors were solidly entrenched with nationwide networks of well-funded and long-established local agents.Under Jack’s plan, National Indemnity, unlike GEICO, would itself use whatever agencies deigned to accept it andconsequently enjoy nocost advantage in its acquisition of business. To overcome those formidable handicaps,\nNational Indemnity focused on “odd-ball” risks, which were deemed unimportant by the “big boys.” And, improbably,the strategy succeeded.\nJack was honest, shrewd, likeable and a bit quirky. In particular, he disliked regulators. When he periodically\nbecame annoyed with their supervision, he would feel an urge to sell his company.\n8\n\nFortunately, I was nearby on one of those occasions. Jack liked the idea of joining Berkshire, and we made a\ndeal in 1967, taking all of 15 minutes to reach a handshake. I never asked for an audit.\nToday National Indemnity is the onlycompany in the world prepared to insure certain giant risks. And, yes,\nit remains based in Omaha, a few miles from Berkshire’s home office.\nOver the years, we have purchased four additional businesses from Omaha families, the best known among\nthem being Nebraska Furniture Mart (“NFM”). The company’s founder, Rose Blumkin (“Mrs. B”), arrived in Seattlein 1915 as a Russian emigrant, unable to read or speak English. She settled in Omaha several years later and by 1936had saved $2,500 with which to start a furniture store.\nCompetitors and suppliers ignored her, and for a time their judgment seemed correct: World War II stalled\nher business, and at yearend 1946, the company’s net worth had grown to only $72,264. Cash, both in the till and ondeposit, totaled $50 (that’s not a typo).\nOne invaluable asset, however, went unrecorded in the 1946 figures: Louie Blumkin, Mrs. B’s only son, had\nrejoined the store after four years in the U.S. Army. Louie fought at Normandy’s Omaha Beach following the D-Dayinvasion, earned a Purple Heart for injuries sustained in the Battle of the Bulge, and finally sailed home in November1945.\nOnce Mrs. B and Louie were reunited, there was no stopping NFM. Driven by their dream, mother and son\nworked days, nights and weekends. The result was a retailing miracle.\nBy 1983, the pair had created a business worth $60 million. That year, on my birthday, Berkshire purchased\n80% of NFM, again without an audit. I counted on Blumkin family members to run the business; the third and fourthgeneration do so today. Mrs. B, it should be noted, worked daily until she was 103 – a ridiculously prematureretirement age as judged by Charlie and me.\nNFM now owns the three largest home-furnishings stores in the U.S. Each set a sales record in 2020, a feat\nachieved despite the closing of NFM’s stores for more than six weeks because of COVID-19.\nA post-script to this story says it all: When Mrs. B’s large family gathered for holiday meals, she always\nasked that they sing a song before eating. Her selection never varied: Irving Berlin’s “God Bless America.”\n************\nLet’s move somewhat east to Knoxville, the third largest city in Tennessee. There, Berkshire has ownership\nintworemarkable companies – Clayton Homes (100% owned) and Pilot Travel Centers (38% owned now, but headed\nfor 80% in 2023).\nEach company was started by a young man who had graduated from the University of Tennessee and stayed\nput in Knoxville. Neither had a meaningful amount of capital nor wealthy parents.\nBut, so what? Today, Clayton and Pilot each have annual pre-tax earnings of more than $1 billion . Together\nthey employ about 47,000 men and women.\nJim Clayton, after several other business ventures, founded Clayton Homes on a shoestring in 1956, and “Big\nJim” Haslam started what became Pilot Travel Centers in 1958 by purchasing a service station for $6,000. Each of themen later brought into the business a son with the same passion, values and brains as his father. Sometimes there is amagic to genes.\n9\n\n“Big Jim” Haslam, now 90, has recently authored an inspirational book in which he relates how Jim Clayton ’s\nson, Kevin, encouraged the Haslams to sell a large portion of Pilot to Berkshire. Every retailer knows that satisfiedcustomers are a store’s best salespeople. That’s true when businesses are changing hands as well.\n************\nWhen you next fly over Knoxville or Omaha, tip your hat to the Claytons, Haslams and Blumkins as well as\nto the army of successful entrepreneurs who populate every part of our country. These builders needed America’sframework for prosperity – a unique experiment when it was crafted in 1789 – to achieve their potential. In turn,America needed citizens like Jim C., Jim H., Mrs. B and Louie to accomplish the miracles our founding fathers sought.\nToday, many people forge similar miracles throughout the world, creating a spread of prosperity that benefits\nallof humanity. In its brief 232 years of existence, however, there has been noincubator for unleashing human\npotential like America. Despite some severe interruptions, our country’s economic progress has been breathtaking.\nBeyond that, we retain our constitutional aspiration of becoming “a more perfect union.” Progress on that\nfront has been slow, uneven and often discouraging. We have, however, moved forward and will continue to do so.\nOur unwavering conclusion: Never bet against America.\nThe Berkshire Partnership\nBerkshire is a Delaware corporation, and our directors must follow the state’s laws. Among them is a\nrequirement that board members must act in the best interest of the corporation and its stockholders. Our directors\nembrace that doctrine.\nIn addition, of course, Berkshire directors want the company to delight its customers, to develop and reward\nthe talents of its 360,000 associates, to behave honorably with lenders and to be regarded as a good citizen of the manycities and states in which we operate. We value these four important constituencies.\nNone of these groups, however, have a vote in determining such matters as dividends, strategic direction,\nCEO selection, or acquisitions and divestitures. Responsibilities like those fall solely on Berkshire’s directors, who\nmust faithfully represent the long-term interests of the corporation and its owners .\nBeyond legal requirements, Charlie and I feel a special obligation to the many individual shareholders of\nBerkshire. A bit of personal history may help you to understand our unusual attachment and how it shapes ourbehavior.\n************\nBefore my Berkshire years, I managed money for many individuals through a series of partnerships, the first\nthree of those formed in 1956. As time passed, the use of multiple entities became unwieldy and, in 1962, weamalgamated 12 partnerships into a single unit, Buffett Partnership Ltd. (“BPL”).\nBy that year, virtually all of my own money, and that of my wife as well, had become invested alongside the\nfunds of my many limited partners. I received no salary or fees. Instead, as the general partner, I was compensated bymy limited partners only after they secured returns above an annual threshold of 6%. If returns failed to meet thatlevel, the shortfall was to be carried forward against my share of future profits. (Fortunately, that never happened:Partnership returns always exceeded the 6% “bogey.”) As the years went by, a large part of the resources of myparents, siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins and in-laws became invested in the partnership.\n10\n\nCharlie formed his partnership in 1962 and operated much as I did. Neither of us had anyinstitutional\ninvestors, and very few of our partners were financially sophisticated. The people who joined our ventures simplytrusted us to treat their money as we treated our own. These individuals – either intuitively or by relying on the adviceof friends – correctly concluded that Charlie and I had an extreme aversion to permanent loss of capital and that wewould not have accepted their money unless we expected to do reasonably well with it.\nI stumbled into business management after BPL acquired control of Berkshire in 1965. Later still, in 1969,\nwe decided to dissolve BPL. After yearend, the partnership distributed, pro-rata, all of its cash along with three stocks,the largest by value being BPL’s 70.5% interest in Berkshire.\nCharlie, meanwhile, wound up his operation in 1977. Among the assets he distributed to partners was a major\ninterest in Blue Chip Stamps, a company his partnership, Berkshire and I jointly controlled. Blue Chip was also amongthe three stocks my partnership had distributed upon its dissolution.\nIn 1983, Berkshire and Blue Chip merged, thereby expanding Berkshire’s base of registered shareholders\nfrom 1,900 to 2,900. Charlie and I wanted everyone – old, new and prospective shareholders – to be on the same page.\nTherefore, the 1983 annual report – up front – laid out Berkshire’s “major business principles.” The first\nprinciple began: “Although our form is corporate, our attitude is partnership.” That defined our relationship in 1983;it defines it today. Charlie and I – and our directors as well – believe this dictum will serve Berkshire well for manydecades to come.\n************\nOwnership of Berkshire now resides in five large “buckets,” one occupied by me as a “founder” of sorts.\nThat bucket is certain to empty as the shares I own are annually distributed to various philanthropies.\nTwo of the remaining four buckets are filled by institutional investors, each handling other people’s money .\nThat, however, is where the similarity between those buckets ends: Their investing procedures could not be moredifferent.\nIn one institutional bucket are index funds, a large and mushrooming segment of the investment world. These\nfunds simply mimic the index that they track. The favorite of index investors is the S&P 500, of which Berkshire is acomponent. Index funds, it should be emphasized, own Berkshire shares simply because they are required to do so.\nThey are on automatic pilot, buying and selling onlyfor “weighting” purposes.\nIn the other institutional bucket are professionals who manage their clients’ money, whether those funds\nbelong to wealthy individuals, universities, pensioners or whomever. These professional managers have a mandate tomove funds from one investment to another based on their judgment as to valuation and prospects. That is anhonorable, though difficult, occupation.\nWe are happy to work for this “active” group, while they meanwhile search for a better place to deploy the\nfunds of their clientele. Some managers, to be sure, have a long-term focus and trade very infrequently. Others usecomputers employing algorithms that may direct the purchase or sale of shares in a nano-second. Some professionalinvestors will come and go based upon their macro-economic judgments.\nOur fourth bucket consists of individual shareholders who operate in a manner similar to the active\ninstitutional managers I’ve just described. These owners, understandably, think of their Berkshire shares as a possiblesource of funds when they see another investment that excites them. We have no quarrel with that attitude, which issimilar to the way we look at some of the equities we own at Berkshire.\n11\n\nAll of that said, Charlie and I would be less than human if we did not feel a special kinship with our fifth\nbucket: the million-plus individual investors who simply trust us to represent their interests, whatever the future may\nbring. They have joined us with no intent to leave, adopting a mindset similar to that held by our original partners.Indeed, many investors from our partnership years, and/or their descendants, remain substantial owners of Berkshire.\nA prototype of those veterans is Stan Truhlsen, a cheerful and generous Omaha ophthalmologist as well as\npersonal friend, who turned 100 on November 13, 2020. In 1959, Stan, along with 10 other young Omaha doctors,formed a partnership with me. The docs creatively labeled their venture Emdee, Ltd. Annually, they joined my wifeand me for a celebratory dinner at our home.\nWhen our partnership distributed its Berkshire shares in 1969, allof the doctors kept the stock they received.\nThey may not have known the ins and outs of investing or accounting, but they didknow that at Berkshire they would\nbe treated as partners.\nTwo of Stan’s comrades from Emdee are now in their high-90s and continue to hold Berkshire shares. This\ngroup’s startling durability – along with the fact that Charlie and I are 97 and 90, respectively – serves up an interestingquestion: Could it be that Berkshire ownership fosters longevity?\n************\nBerkshire’s unusual and valued family of individual shareholders may add to your understanding of our\nreluctance to court Wall Street analysts and institutional investors. We already have the investors we want and don’t\nthink that they, on balance, would be upgraded by replacements.\nThere are only so many seats – that is, shares outstanding – available for Berkshire ownership. And we very\nmuch like the people already occupying them.\nOf course, some turnover in “partners” will occur. Charlie and I hope, however, that it will be minimal. Who,\nafter all, seeks rapid turnover in friends, neighbors or marriage?\nIn 1958, Phil Fisher wrote a superb book on investing. In it, he analogized running a public company to\nmanaging a restaurant. If you are seeking diners, he said, you can attract a clientele and prosper featuring either\nhamburgers served with a Coke ora French cuisine accompanied by exotic wines. But you must not, Fisher warned,\ncapriciously switch from one to the other: Your message to potential customers must be consistent with what they willfind upon entering your premises.\nAt Berkshire, we have been serving hamburgers and Coke for 56 years. We cherish the clientele this fare has\nattracted.\nThe tens of millions of other investors and speculators in the United States and elsewhere have a wide variety\nof equity choices to fit their tastes. They will find CEOs and market gurus with enticing ideas. If they want price\ntargets, managed earnings and “stories,” they will not lack suitors. “Technicians” will confidently instruct them as towhat some wiggles on a chart portend for a stock’s next move. The calls for action will never stop.\nMany of those investors, I should add, will do quite well. After all, ownership of stocks is very much a\n“positive-sum” game. Indeed, a patient and level-headed monkey, who constructs a portfolio by throwing 50 darts ata board listing all of the S&P 500, will – over time – enjoy dividends and capital gains, just as long as it never gets\ntempted to make changes in its original “selections.”\n12\n\nProductive assets such as farms, real estate and, yes, business ownership produce wealth – lots of it. Most\nowners of such properties will be rewarded. All that’s required is the passage of time, an inner calm, amplediversification and a minimization of transactions and fees. Still, investors must never forget that their expenses are\nWall Street’s income . And, unlike my monkey, Wall Streeters do not work for peanuts.\nWhen seats open up at Berkshire – and we hope they are few – we want them to be occupied by newcomers\nwho understand and desire what we offer. After decades of management, Charlie and I remain unable to promiseresults. We cananddo, however, pledge to treat you as partners.\nAnd so, too, will our successors.\nA Berkshire Number that May Surprise You\nRecently, I learned a fact about our company that I had never suspected: Berkshire owns American-based\nproperty, plant and equipment – the sort of assets that make up the “business infrastructure” of our country – with aGAAP valuation exceeding the amount owned by anyother U.S. company. Berkshire’s depreciated cost of these\ndomestic “fixed assets” is $154 billion. Next in line on this list is AT&T, with property, plant and equipment of $127\nbillion.\nOur leadership in fixed-asset ownership, I should add, does not, in itself, signal an investment triumph. The\nbestresults occur at companies that require minimal assets to conduct high-margin businesses – andoffer goods or\nservices that will expand their sales volume with only minor needs for additional capital. We, in fact, own a few ofthese exceptional businesses, but they are relatively small and, at best, grow slowly.\nAsset-heavy companies, however, can be good investments. Indeed, we are delighted with our two\ngiants – BNSF and BHE: In 2011, Berkshire’s first full year of BNSF ownership, the two companies had combinedearnings of $4.2 billion. In 2020, a tough year for many businesses, the pair earned $8.3 billion.\nBNSF and BHE will require major capital expenditures for decades to come. The good news is that both are\nlikely to deliver appropriate returns on the incremental investment.\nLet’s look first at BNSF. Your railroad carries about 15% of all non-local ton-miles (a ton of freight moved\none mile) of goods that move in the United States, whether by rail, truck, pipeline, barge or aircraft. By a significantmargin, BNSF’s loads top those of any other carrier.\nThe history of American railroads is fascinating. After 150 years or so of frenzied construction, skullduggery,\noverbuilding, bankruptcies, reorganizations and mergers, the railroad industry finally emerged a few decades ago asmature and rationalized.\nBNSF began operations in 1850 with a 12-mile line in northeastern Illinois. Today, it has 390 antecedents\nwhose railroads have been purchased or merged. The company’s extensive lineage is laid out athttp://www.bnsf.com/bnsf-resources/pdf/about-bnsf/History_and_Legacy.pdf.\nBerkshire acquired BNSF early in 2010. Since our purchase, the railroad has invested $41 billion in fixed\nassets, an outlay $20 billion in excess of its depreciation charges. Railroading is an outdoor sport, featuring mile-longtrains obliged to reliably operate in both extreme cold and heat, as they all the while encounter every form of terrainfrom deserts to mountains. Massive flooding periodically occurs. BNSF owns 23,000 miles of track, spread throughout28 states, and must spend whatever it takes to maximize safety and service throughout its vast system.\n13\n\nNevertheless, BNSF has paid substantial dividends to Berkshire – $41.8 billion in total. The railroad pays us,\nhowever, only what remains after it both fulfills the needs of its business and maintains a cash balance of about$2 billion. This conservative policy allows BNSF to borrow at low rates, independent of any guarantee of its debt byBerkshire.\nOne further word about BNSF: Last year, Carl Ice, its CEO, and his number two, Katie Farmer, did an\nextraordinary job in controlling expenses while navigating a significant downturn in business. Despite a 7% declinein the volume of goods carried, the two actually increased BNSF’s profit margin by 2.9 percentage points. Carl, aslong planned, retired at yearend and Katie took over as CEO. Your railroad is in good hands.\nBHE, unlike BNSF, pays nodividends on its common stock, a highly-unusual practice in the electric-utility\nindustry. That Spartan policy has been the case throughout our 21 years of ownership. Unlike railroads, our country’selectric utilities need a massive makeover in which the ultimate costs will be staggering. The effort will absorb all ofBHE’s earnings for decades to come. We welcome the challenge and believe the added investment will beappropriately rewarded.\nLet me tell you about one of BHE’s endeavors – its $18 billion commitment to rework and expand a\nsubstantial portion of the outdated grid that now transmits electricity throughout the West. BHE began this project in2006 and expects it to be completed by 2030 – yes, 2030.\nThe advent of renewable energy made our project a societal necessity. Historically, the coal-based generation\nof electricity that long prevailed was located close to huge centers of population. The best sites for the new world ofwind and solar generation, however, are often in remote areas. When BHE assessed the situation in 2006, it was nosecret that a huge investment in western transmission lines had to be made. Very few companies or governmentalentities, however, were in a financial position to raise their hand after they tallied the project’s cost.\nBHE’s decision to proceed, it should be noted, was based upon its trust in America’s political, economic and\njudicial systems. Billions of dollars needed to be invested before meaningful revenue would flow. Transmission lineshad to cross the borders of states and other jurisdictions, each with its own rules and constituencies. BHE would alsoneed to deal with hundreds of landowners and execute complicated contracts with both the suppliers that generatedrenewable power and the far-away utilities that would distribute the electricity to their customers. Competing interestsand defenders of the old order, along with unrealistic visionaries desiring an instantly-new world, had to be brought onboard.\nBoth surprises and delays were certain. Equally certain, however, was the fact that BHE had the managerial\ntalent, the institutional commitment and the financial wherewithal to fulfill its promises. Though it will be many yearsbefore our western transmission project is completed, we are today searching for other projects of similar size to takeon.\nWhatever the obstacles, BHE will be a leader in delivering ever-cleaner energy.\nThe Annual Meeting\nLast year, on February 22\nnd, I wrote you about our plans for a gala annual meeting. Within a month, the\nschedule was junked.\nOur home office group, led by Melissa Shapiro and Marc Hamburg, Berkshire’s CFO, quickly regrouped.\nMiraculously, their improvisations worked. Greg Abel, one of Berkshire’s Vice Chairmen, joined me on stage facinga dark arena, 18,000 empty seats and a camera. There was no rehearsal: Greg and I arrived about 45 minutes before“showtime.”\n14\n\nDebbie Bosanek, my incredible assistant who joined Berkshire 47 years ago at age 17, had put together about\n25 slides displaying various facts and figures that I had assembled at home. An anonymous but highly-capable teamof computer and camera operators projected the slides onto the screen in proper order.\nYahoo streamed the proceedings to a record-sized international audience. Becky Quick of CNBC, operating\nfrom her home in New Jersey, selected questions from thousands that shareholders had earlier submitted or thatviewers had emailed to her during the four hours Greg and I were on stage. See’s peanut brittle and fudge, along withCoca-Cola, provided us with nourishment.\nThis year, on May 1\nst, we are planning to go one better. Again, we will rely on Yahoo and CNBC to perform\nflawlessly. Yahoo will go live at 1 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (“EDT”). Simply navigate tohttps://finance.yahoo.com/brklivestream.\nOur formal meeting will commence at 5:00 p.m. EDT and should finish by 5:30 p.m. Earlier, between\n1:30-5:00, we will answer your questions as relayed by Becky. As always, we will have no foreknowledge as to whatquestions will be asked. Send your zingers to BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com. Yahoo will wrap things up after 5:30.\nAnd now – drum roll, please – a surprise. This year our meeting will be held in Los Angeles ...a n d Charlie\nwill be on stage with me offering answers and observations throughout the 31⁄2-hour question period. I missed him last\nyear and, more important, youclearly missed him. Our other invaluable vice-chairmen, Ajit Jain and Greg Abel, will\nbe with us to answer questions relating to their domains.\nJoin us via Yahoo. Direct your really tough questions to Charlie! We will have fun, and we hope you will as\nwell.\nBetter yet, of course, will be the day when we see you face to face. I hope and expect that will be in 2022.\nThe citizens of Omaha, our exhibiting subsidiaries and all of us at the home office can’t wait to get you back for anhonest-to-God annual meeting, Berkshire-style .\nFebruary 27, 2021 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board\n15",

We are\nhonored by your trust.\nOur position carries with it the responsibility to report to you what we would like to know if wewere the\nabsentee owner and you were the manager. We enjoy communicating directly with you through this annual letter, and\nthrough the annual meeting as well.\nOur policy is to treat all shareholders equally. Therefore, we do not hold discussions with analysts nor large\ninstitutions. Whenever possible, also, we release important communications on Saturday mornings in order tomaximize the time for shareholders and the media to absorb the news before markets open on Monday.\nA wealth of Berkshire facts and figures are set forth in the annual 10-K that the company regularly files with\nthe S.E.C. and that we reproduce on pages K-1 – K-119. Some shareholders will find this detail engrossing; otherswill simply prefer to learn what Charlie and I believe is new or interesting at Berkshire.\nAlas, there was little action of that sort in 2021. We did, though, make reasonable progress in increasing the\nintrinsic value of your shares. That task has been my primary duty for 57 years. And it will continue to be.\nWhat You Own\nBerkshire owns a wide variety of businesses, some in their entirety, some only in part. The second group\nlargely consists of marketable common stocks of major American companies. Additionally, we own a few non-U.S.equities and participate in several joint ventures or other collaborative activities.\nWhatever our form of ownership, our goal is to have meaningful investments in businesses with both durable\neconomic advantages and a first-class CEO. Please note particularly that we own stocks based upon our expectationsabout their long-term business performance and notbecause we view them as vehicles for timely market moves. That\npoint is crucial: Charlie and I are notstock-pickers; we are business-pickers.\nI make many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of businesses includes some enterprises that\nhave truly extraordinary economics, many others that enjoy good economic characteristics, and a few that aremarginal. One advantage of our common-stock segment is that – on occasion – it becomes easy to buy pieces of\nwonderful businesses at wonderful prices. That shooting-fish-in-a-barrel experience is very rare in negotiated\ntransactions and never occurs en masse . It is also far easier to exit from a mistake when it has been made in the\nmarketable arena.\n3\n\nSurprise, Surprise\nHere are a few items about your company that often surprise even seasoned investors:\n• Many people perceive Berkshire as a large and somewhat strange collection of financial assets. In truth,\nBerkshire owns and operates more U.S.-based “infrastructure” assets – classified on our balance sheet as\nproperty, plant and equipment – than are owned and operated by any other American corporation. That\nsupremacy has never been our goal. It has, however, become a fact.\nAt yearend, those domestic infrastructure assets were carried on Berkshire’s balance sheet at $158 billion.\nThat number increased last year and will continue to increase. Berkshire always will be building.\n• Every year, your company makes substantial federal income tax payments. In 2021, for example, we paid\n$3.3 billion while the U.S. Treasury reported total corporate income-tax receipts of $402 billion.\nAdditionally, Berkshire pays substantial state and foreign taxes. “I gave at the office” is an unassailableassertion when made by Berkshire shareholders.\nBerkshire’s history vividly illustrates the invisible and often unrecognized financial partnership between\ngovernment and American businesses. Our tale begins early in 1955, when Berkshire Fine Spinning andHathaway Manufacturing agreed to merge their businesses. In their requests for shareholder approval, thesevenerable New England textile companies expressed high hopes for the combination.\nThe Hathaway solicitation, for example, assured its shareholders that “The combination of the resources and\nmanagements will result in one of the strongest and most efficient organizations in the textile industry.” Thatupbeat view was endorsed by the company’s advisor, Lehman Brothers (yes, that Lehman Brothers).\nI’m sure it was a joyous day in both Fall River (Berkshire) and New Bedford (Hathaway) when the union\nwas consummated. After the bands stopped playing and the bankers went home, however, the shareholdersreaped a disaster.\nIn the nine years following the merger, Berkshire’s owners watched the company’s net worth crater from\n$51.4 million to $22.1 million. In part, this decline was caused by stock repurchases, ill-advised dividendsand plant shutdowns. But nine years of effort by many thousands of employees delivered an operating lossas well. Berkshire’s struggles were not unusual: The New England textile industry had silently entered anextended and non-reversible death march.\nDuring the nine post-merger years, the U.S. Treasury suffered as well from Berkshire’s troubles. All told, the\ncompany paid the government only $337,359 in income tax during that period – a pathetic $100 per day .\nEarly in 1965, things changed. Berkshire installed new management that redeployed available cash and\nsteered essentially allearnings into a variety of good businesses, most of which remained good through the\nyears. Coupling reinvestment of earnings with the power of compounding worked its magic, and shareholdersprospered.\nBerkshire’s owners, it should be noted, were not the only beneficiary of that course correction. Their “silent\npartner,” the U.S. Treasury, proceeded to collect many tens of billions of dollars from the company in income\ntax payments. Remember the $100 daily? Now, Berkshire pays roughly $9 million daily to the Treasury.\n4\n\nIn fairness to our governmental partner, our shareholders should acknowledge – indeed trumpet – the fact\nthat Berkshire’s prosperity has been fostered mightily because the company has operated in America. Our\ncountry would have done splendidly in the years since 1965 without Berkshire. Absent our American home,\nhowever, Berkshire would never have come close to becoming what it is today. When you see the flag, saythanks.\n• From an $8.6 million purchase of National Indemnity in 1967, Berkshire has become the world leader in\ninsurance “float” – money we hold and can invest but that does not belong to us. Including a relatively small\nsum derived from life insurance, Berkshire’s total float has grown from $19 million when we entered the\ninsurance business to $147 billion .\nSo far, this float has cost us less than nothing. Though we have experienced a number of years when insurance\nlosses combined with operating expenses exceeded premiums, overall we have earned a modest 55-year\nprofit from the underwriting activities that generated our float.\nOf equal importance, float is very sticky. Funds attributable to our insurance operations come and go daily,\nbut their aggregate total is immune from precipitous decline. When it comes to investing float, we cantherefore think long-term.\nIf you are not already familiar with the concept of float, I refer you to a long explanation on page A-5. To\nmy surprise, our float increased $9 billion last year, a buildup of value that is important to Berkshire ownersthough is not reflected in our GAAP (“generally-accepted accounting principles”) presentation of earnings\nand net worth.\nMuch of our huge value creation in insurance is attributable to Berkshire’s good luck in my 1986 hiring of\nAjit Jain. We first met on a Saturday morning, and I quickly asked Ajit what his insurance experience hadbeen. He replied, “None.”\nI said, “Nobody’s perfect,” and hired him. That was my lucky day: Ajit actually was as perfect a choice as\ncould have been made. Better yet, he continues to be – 35 years later.\nOne final thought about insurance: I believe that it is likely – but farfrom assured – that Berkshire’s float\ncan be maintained without our incurring a long-term underwriting loss. I am certain , however, that there will\nbe some years when we experience such losses, perhaps involving very large sums.\nBerkshire is constructed to handle catastrophic events as no other insurer – and that priority will remain long\nafter Charlie and I are gone.\nOur Four Giants\nThrough Berkshire, our shareholders own many dozens of businesses. Some of these, in turn, have a\ncollection of subsidiaries of their own. For example, Marmon has more than 100 individual business operations,ranging from the leasing of railroad cars to the manufacture of medical devices.\n• Nevertheless, operations of our “Big Four” companies account for a very large chunk of Berkshire’s value.\nLeading this list is our cluster of insurers. Berkshire effectively owns 100% of this group, whose massivefloat value we earlier described. The invested assets of these insurers are further enlarged by the extraordinaryamount of capital we invest to back up their promises.\n5\n\nThe insurance business is made to order for Berkshire. The product will never be obsolete, and sales volume\nwill generally increase along with both economic growth and inflation. Also, integrity and capital will foreverbe important. Our company can and will behave well.\nThere are, of course, other insurers with excellent business models and prospects. Replication of Berkshire’s\noperation, however, would be almost impossible.\n• Apple – our runner-up Giant as measured by its yearend market value – is a different sort of holding. Here,\nour ownership is a mere 5.55%, up from 5.39% a year earlier. That increase sounds like small potatoes. Butconsider that each 0.1% of Apple’s 2021 earnings amounted to $100 million . We spent noBerkshire funds\nto gain our accretion. Apple’s repurchases did the job.\nIt’s important to understand that only dividends from Apple are counted in the GAAP earnings Berkshire\nreports – and last year, Apple paid us $785 million of those. Yet our “share” of Apple’s earnings amountedto a staggering $5.6 billion . Much of what the company retained was used to repurchase Apple shares, an act\nwe applaud. Tim Cook, Apple’s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple products as his firstlove, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim’s managerial touch as well.\n• BNSF, our third Giant, continues to be the number one artery of American commerce, which makes it an\nindispensable asset for America as well as for Berkshire. If the many essential products BNSF carries wereinstead hauled by truck, America’s carbon emissions would soar.\nYour railroad had record earnings of $6 billion in 2021. Here, it should be noted, we are talking about the\nold-fashioned sort of earnings that we favor: a figure calculated after interest, taxes, depreciation,\namortization and all forms of compensation. (Our definition suggests a warning: Deceptive “adjustments” toearnings – to use a polite description – have become both more frequent and more fanciful as stocks haverisen. Speaking less politely, I would say that bull markets breed bloviated bull . . ..)\nBNSF trains traveled 143 million miles last year and carried 535 million tons of cargo. Both accomplishments\nfar exceed those of any other American carrier. You can be proud of your railroad.\n• BHE, our final Giant, earned a record $4 billion in 2021. That’s up more than 30-fold from the $122 million\nearned in 2000, the year that Berkshire first purchased a BHE stake. Now, Berkshire owns 91.1% of thecompany.\nBHE’s record of societal accomplishment is as remarkable as its financial performance. The company had\nnowind or solar generation in 2000. It was then regarded simply as a relatively new and minor participant in\nthe huge electric utility industry. Subsequently, under David Sokol’s and Greg Abel’s leadership, BHE hasbecome a utility powerhouse (no groaning, please) and a leading force in wind, solar and transmissionthroughout much of the United States.\nGreg’s report on these accomplishments appears on pages A-3 and A-4. The profile you will find there is not\nin any way one of those currently-fashionable “green-washing” stories. BHE has been faithfully detailing itsplans and performance in renewables and transmissions every year since 2007 .\nTo further review this information, visit BHE’s website at brkenergy.com. There, you will see that the\ncompany has long been making climate-conscious moves that soak up allof its earnings. More opportunities\nlie ahead. BHE has the management, the experience, the capital and the appetite for the huge power projectsthat our country needs.\n6\n\nInvestments\nNow let’s talk about companies we don’t control, a list that again references Apple. Below we list our fifteen\nlargest equity holdings, several of which are selections of Berkshire’s two long-time investment managers, ToddCombs and Ted Weschler. At yearend, this valued pair had total authority in respect to $34 billion of investments,\nmany of which do not meet the threshold value we use in the table. Also, a significant portion of the dollars that Toddand Ted manage are lodged in various pension plans of Berkshire-owned businesses, with the assets of these plans not\nincluded in this table.\n12/31/21\nShares\nCompanyPercentage of\nCompany\nOwned Cost* Market\n(in millions)\n151,610,700 American Express Company .................... 19.9 1,287 24,804\n907,559,761 Apple Inc. .................................. 5 . 6 31,089 161,155\n1,032,852,006 Bank of America Corp. ........................ 12.8 14,631 45,952\n66,835,615 The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. ............ 8 . 3 2,918 3,882\n225,000,000 BYD Co.

Early\nin 2023, Berkshire will purchase an additional interest in Pilot that will raise our ownership to 80% and lead to ourfully consolidating Pilot’s earnings, assets and liabilities in our financial statements.\n7\n\nU.S. Treasury Bills\nBerkshire’s balance sheet includes $144 billion of cash and cash equivalents (excluding the holdings of\nBNSF and BHE). Of this sum, $120 billion is held in U.S. Treasury bills, all maturing in less than a year. That stakeleaves Berkshire financing about\n1⁄2of 1% of the publicly-held national debt.\nCharlie and I have pledged that Berkshire (along with our subsidiaries other than BNSF and BHE) will always\nhold more than $30 billion of cash and equivalents. We want your company to be financially impregnable and never\ndependent on the kindness of strangers (or even that of friends). Both of us like to sleep soundly, and we want ourcreditors, insurance claimants and you to do so as well.\nBut $144 billion?That imposing sum, I assure you, is not some deranged expression of patriotism. Nor have Charlie and I lost\nour overwhelming preference for business ownership. Indeed, I first manifested my enthusiasm for that 80 years ago,\non March 11, 1942, when I purchased three shares of Cities Services preferred stock. Their cost was $114.75 andrequired allof my savings. (The Dow Jones Industrial Average that day closed at 99, a fact that should scream to you:\nNever bet against America.)\nAfter my initial plunge, I always kept at least 80% of my net worth in equities. My favored status throughout\nthat period was 100% – and still is. Berkshire’s current 80%-or-so position in businesses is a consequence of myfailure to find entire companies or small portions thereof (that is, marketable stocks) which meet our criteria for long-term holding.\nCharlie and I have endured similar cash-heavy positions from time to time in the past. These periods are\nnever pleasant; they are also never permanent. And, fortunately, we have had a mildly attractive alternative during2020 and 2021 for deploying capital. Read on.\nShare Repurchases\nThere are three ways that we can increase the value of your investment. The first is always front and center\nin our minds: Increase the long-term earning power of Berkshire’s controlled businesses through internal growth orby making acquisitions. Today, internal opportunities deliver far better returns than acquisitions. The size of thoseopportunities, however, is small compared to Berkshire’s resources.\nOur second choice is to buy non-controlling part-interests in the many good or great businesses that are\npublicly traded. From time to time, such possibilities are both numerous and blatantly attractive. Today, though, wefind little that excites us.\nThat’s largely because of a truism: Long-term interest rates that are low push the prices of allproductive\ninvestments upward, whether these are stocks, apartments, farms, oil wells, whatever. Other factors influencevaluations as well, but interest rates will always be important.\nOur final path to value creation is to repurchase Berkshire shares. Through that simple act, we increase your\nshare of the many controlled and non-controlled businesses Berkshire owns. When the price/value equation is right,\nthis path is the easiest and most certain way for us to increase your wealth. (Alongside the accretion of value tocontinuing shareholders, a couple of other parties gain: Repurchases are modestly beneficial to the seller of therepurchased shares and to society as well.)\n8\n\nPeriodically, as alternative paths become unattractive, repurchases make good sense for Berkshire’s owners.\nDuring the past two years, we therefore repurchased 9% of the shares that were outstanding at yearend 2019 for a total\ncost of $51.7 billion. That expenditure left our continuing shareholders owning about 10% more of allBerkshire\nbusinesses, whether these are wholly-owned (such as BNSF and GEICO) or partly-owned (such as Coca-Cola andMoody’s).\nI want to underscore that for Berkshire repurchases to make sense, our shares must offer appropriate value.\nWe don’t want to overpay for the shares of other companies, and it would be value -destroying if we were to overpay\nwhen we are buying Berkshire. As of February 23, 2022, since yearend we repurchased additional shares at a cost of$1.2 billion. Our appetite remains large but will always remain price-dependent.\nIt should be noted that Berkshire’s buyback opportunities are limited because of its high-class investor base.\nIf our shares were heavily held by short-term speculators, both price volatility and transaction volumes wouldmaterially increase. That kind of reshaping would offer us far greater opportunities for creating value by makingrepurchases. Nevertheless, Charlie and I far prefer the owners we have, even though their admirable buy-and-keepattitudes limit the extent to which long-term shareholders can profit from opportunistic repurchases.\nFinally, one easily-overlooked value calculation specific to Berkshire: As we’ve discussed, insurance “float”\nof the right sort is of great value to us. As it happens, repurchases automatically increase the amount of “float” per\nshare . That figure has increased during the past two years by 25% – going from $79,387 per “A” share to $99,497, a\nmeaningful gain that, as noted, owes some thanks to repurchases.\nA Wonderful Man and a Wonderful Business\nLast year, Paul Andrews died. Paul was the founder and CEO of TTI, a Fort Worth-based subsidiary of\nBerkshire. Throughout his life – in both his business and his personal pursuits – Paul quietly displayed all the qualities\nthat Charlie and I admire. His story should be told.\nIn 1971, Paul was working as a purchasing agent for General Dynamics when the roof fell in. After losing a\nhuge defense contract, the company fired thousands of employees, including Paul.\nWith his first child due soon, Paul decided to bet on himself, using $500 of his savings to found Tex-Tronics\n(later renamed TTI). The company set itself up to distribute small electronic components, and first-year sales totaled$112,000. Today, TTI markets more than one million different items with annual volume of $7.7 billion.\nBut back to 2006: Paul, at 63, then found himself happy with his family, his job, and his associates. But he\nhad one nagging worry, heightened because he had recently witnessed a friend’s early death and the disastrous resultsthat followed for that man’s family and business. What, Paul asked himself in 2006, would happen to the many peopledepending on him if he should unexpectedly die?\nFor a year, Paul wrestled with his options. Sell to a competitor? From a strictly economic viewpoint, that\ncourse made the most sense. After all, competitors could envision lucrative “synergies” – savings that would beachieved as the acquiror slashed duplicated functions at TTI.\nB u t...S u c hap u r c h aser would most certainly also retain itsCFO, itslegal counsel, itsHR unit. Their TTI\ncounterparts would therefore be sent packing. And ugh! If a new distribution center were to be needed, the acquirer’shome city would certainly be favored over Fort Worth.\n9\n\nWhatever the financial benefits, Paul quickly concluded that selling to a competitor was not for him. He next\nconsidered seeking a financial buyer, a species once labeled – aptly so – a leveraged buyout firm. Paul knew, however,that such a purchaser would be focused on an “exit strategy.” And who could know what that would be? Broodingover it all, Paul found himself having no interest in handing his 35-year-old creation over to a reseller.\nWhen Paul met me, he explained why he had eliminated these two alternatives as buyers. He then summed\nup his dilemma by saying – in far more tactful phrasing than this – “After a year of pondering the alternatives, I wantto sell to Berkshire because you are the only guy left.” So, I made an offer and Paul said “Yes.” One meeting; onelunch; one deal.\nTo say we both lived happily ever after is an understatement. When Berkshire purchased TTI, the company\nemployed 2,387. Now the number is 8,043. A large percentage of that growth took place in Fort Worth and environs.Earnings have increased 673%.\nAnnually, I would call Paul and tell him his salary should be substantially increased. Annually, he would tell\nme, “We can talk about that next year, Warren; I’m too busy now.”\nWhen Greg Abel and I attended Paul’s memorial service, we met children, grandchildren, long-time\nassociates (including TTI’s first employee) and John Roach, the former CEO of a Fort Worth company Berkshire hadpurchased in 2000. John had steered his friend Paul to Omaha, instinctively knowing we would be a match.\nAt the service, Greg and I heard about the multitudes of people and organizations that Paul had silently\nsupported. The breadth of his generosity was extraordinary – geared always to improving the lives of others,particularly those in Fort Worth.\nIn all ways, Paul was a class act.\n************\nGood luck – occasionally extraordinary luck – has played its part at Berkshire. If Paul and I had not enjoyed\na mutual friend – John Roach – TTI would not have found its home with us. But that ample serving of luck was onlythe beginning. TTI was soon to lead Berkshire to its most important acquisition.\nEvery fall, Berkshire directors gather for a presentation by a few of our executives. We sometimes choose\nthe site based upon the location of a recent acquisition, by that means allowing directors to meet the new subsidiary’sCEO and learn more about the acquiree’s activities.\nIn the fall of 2009, we consequently selected Fort Worth so that we could visit TTI. At that time, BNSF,\nwhich also had Fort Worth as its hometown, was the third-largest holding among our marketable equities. Despite thatlarge stake, I had never visited the railroad’s headquarters.\nDeb Bosanek, my assistant, scheduled our board’s opening dinner for October 22. Meanwhile, I arranged to\narrive earlier that day to meet with Matt Rose, CEO of BNSF, whose accomplishments I had long admired. When Imade the date, I had no idea that our get-together would coincide with BNSF’s third-quarter earnings report, whichwas released late on the 22\nnd.\nThe market reacted badly to the railroad’s results. The Great Recession was in full force in the third quarter,\nand BNSF’s earnings reflected that slump. The economic outlook was also bleak, and Wall Street wasn’t feelingfriendly to railroads – or much else.\n10\n\nOn the following day, I again got together with Matt and suggested that Berkshire would offer the railroad a\nbetter long-term home than it could expect as a public company. I also told him the maximum price that Berkshirewould pay.\nMatt relayed the offer to his directors and advisors. Eleven busy days later, Berkshire and BNSF announced\na firm deal. And here I’ll venture a rare prediction: BNSF will be a key asset for Berkshire and our country a century\nfrom now.\nThe BNSF acquisition would never have happened if Paul Andrews hadn’t sized up Berkshire as the right\nhome for TTI.\nThanks\nI taught my first investing class 70 years ago. Since then, I have enjoyed working almost every year with\nstudents of all ages, finally “retiring” from that pursuit in 2018.\nAlong the way, my toughest audience was my grandson’s fifth-grade class. The 11-year-olds were squirming\nin their seats and giving me blank stares until I mentioned Coca-Cola and its famous secret formula. Instantly, everyhand went up, and I learned that “secrets” are catnip to kids.\nTeaching, like writing, has helped me develop and clarify my own thoughts. Charlie calls this phenomenon\nthe orangutan effect: If you sit down with an orangutan and carefully explain to it one of your cherished ideas, youmay leave behind a puzzled primate, but will yourself exit thinking more clearly.\nTalking to university students is far superior. I have urged that they seek employment in (1) the field and (2)\nwith the kind of people they would select, if they had no need for money. Economic realities, I acknowledge, may\ninterfere with that kind of search. Even so, I urge the students never to give up the quest, for when they find that sortof job, they will no longer be “working.”\nCharlie and I, ourselves, followed that liberating course after a few early stumbles. We both started as part-\ntimers at my grandfather’s grocery store, Charlie in 1940 and I in 1942. We were each assigned boring tasks and paidlittle, definitely not what we had in mind. Charlie later took up law, and I tried selling securities. Job satisfactioncontinued to elude us.\nFinally, at Berkshire, we found what we love to do. With very few exceptions, we have now “worked” for\nmany decades with people whom we like and trust. It’s a joy in life to join with managers such as Paul Andrews orthe Berkshire families I told you about last year. In our home office, we employ decent and talented people – no jerks.Turnover averages, perhaps, one person per year.\nIw o u l dl i k e ,h o w e v e r ,t oe m p h a s i z eaf u r t h e ri t e mt h a tt u r n so u rj o b si n t of u na n ds a t i s f a c t i o n----w o r k i n g\nfor you. There is nothing more rewarding to Charlie and me than enjoying the trust of individual long-term\nshareholders who, for many decades, have joined us with the expectation that we would be a reliable custodian of theirfunds.\nObviously, we can’t select our owners, as we could do if our form of operation were a partnership. Anyone\ncan buy shares of Berkshire today with the intention of soon reselling them. For sure, we get a few of that type ofshareholder, just as we get index funds that own huge amounts of Berkshire simply because they are required to doso.\n11\n\nTo a truly unusual degree, however, Berkshire has as owners a very large corps of individuals and families\nthat have elected to join us with an intent approaching “til death do us part.” Often, they have trusted us with a large– some might say excessive – portion of their savings.\nBerkshire, these shareholders would sometimes acknowledge, might be far from the best selection they could\nhave made. But they would add that Berkshire would rank high among those with which they would be mostcomfortable. And people who are comfortable with their investments will, on average, achieve better results than thosewho are motivated by ever-changing headlines, chatter and promises.\nLong-term individual owners are both the “partners” Charlie and I have always sought and the ones we\nconstantly have in mind as we make decisions at Berkshire. To them we say, “It feels good to ‘work’ for you, and youhave our thanks for your trust.”\nThe Annual Meeting\nClear your calendar! Berkshire will have its annual gathering of capitalists in Omaha on Friday, April 29th\nthrough Sunday, May 1st. The details regarding the weekend are laid out on pages A-1 and A-2. Omaha eagerly awaits\nyou, as do I.\nI will end this letter with a sales pitch. “Cousin” Jimmy Buffett has designed a pontoon “party” boat that is\nnow being manufactured by Forest River, a Berkshire subsidiary. The boat will be introduced on April 29 at ourBerkshire Bazaar of Bargains. And, for two days only, shareholders will be able to purchase Jimmy’s masterpiece ata 10% discount. Your bargain-hunting chairman will be buying a boat for his family’s use. Join me.\nFebruary 26, 2022 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board\n12",

We are grateful for their enduring trust, a relationship that often spans\nmuch of their adult lifetime. It is those dedicated savers that are forefront in my mind as I writethis letter.\nA common belief is that people choose to save when young, expecting thereby to maintain\ntheir living standards after retirement. Any assets that remain at death, this theory says, will usuallybe left to their families or, possibly, to friends and philanthropy.\nOur experience has differed. We believe Berkshire’s individual holders largely to be of the\nonce-a-saver, always-a-saver variety. Though these people live well, they eventually dispensemost of their funds to philanthropic organizations. These, in turn, redistribute the funds byexpenditures intended to improve the lives of a great many people who are unrelated to the originalbenefactor. Sometimes, the results have been spectacular.\nThe disposition of money unmasks humans. Charlie and I watch with pleasure the vast flow\nof Berkshire-generated funds to public needs and, alongside, the infrequency with which ourshareholders opt for look-at-me assets and dynasty-building.\nWho wouldn’t enjoy working for shareholders like ours?\nWhat We Do\nCharlie and I allocate your savings at Berkshire between two related forms of ownership.\nFirst, we invest in businesses that we control, usually buying 100% of each. Berkshire directscapital allocation at these subsidiaries and selects the CEOs who make day-by-day operatingdecisions. When large enterprises are being managed, both trust and rules are essential. Berkshireemphasizes the former to an unusual – some would say extreme – degree. Disappointments areinevitable. We are understanding about business mistakes; our tolerance for personal misconduct\nis zero.\nIn our second category of ownership, we buy publicly-traded stocks through which we\npassively own pieces of businesses. Holding these investments, we have no say in management.\n3\n\nOur goal in both forms of ownership is to make meaningful investments in businesses with\nboth long-lasting favorable economic characteristics and trustworthy managers. Please noteparticularly that we own publicly-traded stocks based on our expectations about their long-termbusiness performance, not because we view them as vehicles for adroit purchases and sales. That\npoint is crucial: Charlie and I are notstock-pickers; we are business-pickers.\nOver the years, I have made many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of\nbusinesses currently consists of a few enterprises that have truly extraordinary economics, manythat enjoy very good economic characteristics, and a large group that are marginal. Along the way,other businesses in which I have invested have died, their products unwanted by the public.Capitalism has two sides: The system creates an ever-growing pile of losers while concurrentlydelivering a gusher of improved goods and services. Schumpeter called this phenomenon “creativedestruction.”\nOne advantage of our publicly-traded segment is that – episodically – it becomes easy to\nbuy pieces of wonderful businesses at wonderful prices. It’s crucial to understand that stocks often\ntrade at truly foolish prices, both high and low. “Efficient” markets exist only in textbooks. Intruth, marketable stocks and bonds are baffling, their behavior usually understandable only inretrospect.\nControlled businesses are a different breed. They sometimes command ridiculously higher\nprices than justified but are almost never available at bargain valuations. Unless under duress, theowner of a controlled business gives no thought to selling at a panic-type valuation.\n************\nAt this point, a report card from me is appropriate: In 58 years of Berkshire management,\nmost of my capital-allocation decisions have been no better than so-so. In some cases, also, badmoves by me have been rescued by very large doses of luck. (Remember our escapes fromnear-disasters at USAir and Salomon? I certainly do.)\nOur satisfactory results have been the product of about a dozen truly good decisions – that\nwould be about one every five years – anda sometimes-forgotten advantage that favors long-term\ninvestors such as Berkshire. Let’s take a peek behind the curtain.\nThe Secret Sauce\nIn August 1994 – yes, 1994 – Berkshire completed its seven-year purchase of the 400\nmillion shares of Coca-Cola we now own. The total cost was $1.3 billion – then a very meaningfuls u ma tB e r k s h i r e .\nThe cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend\nhad increased to $704 million. Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays. All Charlie\nand I were required to do was cash Coke’s quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checksa r eh i g h l yl i k e l yt og r o w .\n4\n\nAmerican Express is much the same story. Berkshire’s purchases of Amex were essentially\ncompleted in 1995 and, coincidentally, also cost $1.3 billion. Annual dividends received from thisinvestment have grown from $41 million to $302 million. Those checks, too, seem highly likely\nto increase.\nThese dividend gains, though pleasing, are farfrom spectacular. But they bring with them\nimportant gains in stock prices. At yearend, our Coke investment was valued at $25 billion whileAmex was recorded at $22 billion. Each holding now accounts for roughly 5% of Berkshire’s networth, akin to its weighting long ago.\nAssume, for a moment, I had made a similarly-sized investment mistake in the 1990s, one\nthat flat-lined and simply retained its $1.3 billion value in 2022. (An example would be ahigh-grade 30-year bond.) That disappointing investment would now represent an insignificant0.3% of Berkshire’s net worth and would be delivering to us an unchanged $80 million or so ofannual income.\nThe lesson for investors: The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom.\nOver time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders. And, yes, it helps to start early and liveinto your 90s as well.\nThe Past Year in Brief\nBerkshire had a good year in 2022. The company’s operating earnings – our term for\nincome calculated using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), exclusive of\ncapital gains or losses from equity holdings – set a record at $30.8 billion. Charlie and I focus onthis operational figure and urge you to do so as well. The GAAP figure, absent our adjustment ,\nfluctuates wildly and capriciously at every reporting date. Note its acrobatic behavior in 2022,which is in no way unusual:\nEarnings in $ billions\n2022 Quarter “Operating Earnings”GAAP Earnings We\nare Required to Report\n1 7.0 5.5\n2 9.3 (43.8)3 7.8 (2.7)4 6.7 18.2\nThe GAAP earnings are 100% misleading when viewed quarterly or even annually. Capital\ngains, to be sure, have been hugely important to Berkshire over past decades, and we expect themto be meaningfully positive in future decades. But their quarter-by-quarter gyrations, regularly andmindlessly headlined by media, totally misinform investors.\n5\n\nA second positive development for Berkshire last year was our purchase of Alleghany\nCorporation, a property-casualty insurer captained by Joe Brandon. I’ve worked with Joe in thepast, and he understands both Berkshire and insurance. Alleghany delivers special value tous because Berkshire’s unmatched financial strength allows its insurance subsidiaries to followvaluable and enduring investment strategies unavailable to virtually all competitors.\nAided by Alleghany, our insurance float increased during 2022 from $147 billion to $164\nbillion. With disciplined underwriting, these funds have a decent chance of being cost-free over\ntime. Since purchasing our first property-casualty insurer in 1967, Berkshire’s float has increased8,000-fold through acquisitions, operations and innovations. Though notrecognized in our\nfinancial statements, this float has been an extraordinary asset for Berkshire. New shareholderscan get an understanding of its value by reading our annually updated explanation of float onpage A-2.\n************\nAvery minor gain in per-share intrinsic value took place in 2022 through Berkshire share\nrepurchases as well as similar moves at Apple and American Express, both significant investeesof ours. At Berkshire, we directly increased your interest in our unique collection of businesses byrepurchasing 1.2% of the company’s outstanding shares. At Apple and Amex, repurchasesincreased Berkshire’s ownership a bit without any cost to us.\nThe math isn’t complicated: When the share count goes down, your interest in our many\nbusinesses goes up. Every small bit helps if repurchases are made at value-accretive prices. Just\nas surely, when a company overpays for repurchases, the continuing shareholders lose. At such\ntimes, gains flow only to the selling shareholders and to the friendly, but expensive, investment\nbanker who recommended the foolish purchases.\nGains from value-accretive repurchases, it should be emphasized, benefit allowners – in\nevery respect. Imagine, if you will, three fully-informed shareholders of a local auto dealership,\none of whom manages the business. Imagine, further, that one of the passive owners wishes to sellhis interest back to the company at a price attractive to the two continuing shareholders. Whencompleted, has this transaction harmed anyone? Is the manager somehow favored over thecontinuing passive owners? Has the public been hurt?\nWhen you are told that allrepurchases are harmful to shareholders orto the country, or\nparticularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or asilver-tongued demagogue (characters that are notmutually exclusive).\n6\n\nAlmost endless details of Berkshire’s 2022 operations are laid out on pages K-33 – K-66.\nCharlie and I, along with many Berkshire shareholders, enjoy poring over the many facts andfigures laid out in that section. These pages are not, however, required reading. There are many\nBerkshire centimillionaires and, yes, billionaires who have never studied our financial figures.They simply know that Charlie and I – along with our families and close friends – continue to havevery significant investments in Berkshire, and they trust us to treat their money as we do our own.\nAnd thatis a promise we can make.\n************\nFinally, an important warning: Even the operating earnings figure that we favor can easily\nbe manipulated by managers who wish to do so. Such tampering is often thought of as sophisticatedby CEOs, directors and their advisors. Reporters and analysts embrace its existence as well.Beating “expectations” is heralded as a managerial triumph.\nThat activity is disgusting. It requires no talent to manipulate numbers: Only a deep desire\nto deceive is required. “Bold imaginative accounting,” as a CEO once described his deception tome, has become one of the shames of capitalism.\n58 Years – and a Few Figures\nIn 1965, Berkshire was a one-trick pony, the owner of a venerable – but doomed – New\nEngland textile operation. With that business on a death march, Berkshire needed an immediatefresh start. Looking back, I was slow to recognize the severity of its problems.\nAnd then came a stroke of good luck: National Indemnity became available in 1967, and\nwe shifted our resources toward insurance and other non-textile operations.\nThus began our journey to 2023, a bumpy road involving a combination of continuous\nsavings by our owners (that is, by their retaining earnings), the power of compounding, ouravoidance of major mistakes and – most important of all – the American Tailwind. America would\nhave done fine without Berkshire. The reverse is nottrue.\nBerkshire now enjoys major ownership in an unmatched collection of huge and diversified\nbusinesses. Let’s first look at the 5,000 or so publicly-held companies that trade daily onNASDAQ, the NYSE and related venues. Within this group is housed the members of the S&P500 Index, an elite collection of large and well-known American companies.\nIn aggregate, the 500 earned $1.8 trillion in 2021. I don’t yet have the final results for 2022.\nUsing, therefore, the 2021 figures, only 128 of the 500 (including Berkshire itself) earned $3 billionor more. Indeed, 23 lost money.\n7\n\nAt yearend 2022, Berkshire was the largest owner of eight of these giants: American\nExpress, Bank of America, Chevron, Coca-Cola, HP Inc., Moody’s, Occidental Petroleum andParamount Global.\nIn addition to those eight investees, Berkshire owns 100% of BNSF and 92% of BH\nEnergy, each with earnings that exceed the $3 billion mark noted above ($5.9 billion at BNSF and$4.3 billion at BHE). Were these companies publicly-owned, they would replace two presentmembers of the 500. All told, our ten controlled and non-controlled behemoths leave Berkshiremore broadly aligned with the country’s economic future than is the case at any other U.S.company. (This calculation leaves aside “fiduciary” operations such as pension funds andinvestment companies.) In addition, Berkshire’s insurance operation, though conducted throughmany individually-managed subsidiaries, has a value comparable to BNSF or BHE.\nAs for the future, Berkshire will always hold a boatload of cash and U.S. Treasury bills\nalong with a wide array of businesses. We will also avoid behavior that could result in any\nuncomfortable cash needs at inconvenient times, including financial panics and unprecedentedinsurance losses. Our CEO will always be the Chief Risk Officer – a task it is irresponsible todelegate. Additionally, our future CEOs will have a significant part of their net worth in Berkshireshares, bought with their own money. Andyes, our shareholders will continue to save and prosper\nby retaining earnings.\nAt Berkshire, there will be no finish line.\nSome Surprising Facts About Federal Taxes\nDuring the decade ending in 2021, the United States Treasury received about $32.3 trillion\nin taxes while it spent $43.9 trillion.\nThough economists, politicians and many of the public have opinions about the\nconsequences of that huge imbalance, Charlie and I plead ignorance and firmly believe thatnear-term economic and market forecasts are worse than useless. Our job is to manage Berkshire’soperations and finances in a manner that will achieve an acceptable result over time and that willpreserve the company’s unmatched staying power when financial panics or severe worldwiderecessions occur. Berkshire also offers some modest protection from runaway inflation, but thisattribute is farfrom perfect. Huge and entrenched fiscal deficits have consequences.\nThe $32 trillion of revenue was garnered by the Treasury through individual income taxes\n(48%), social security and related receipts (34\n1⁄2%), corporate income tax payments (81⁄2%) and a\nwide variety of lesser levies. Berkshire’s contribution via the corporate income tax was $32 billionduring the decade, almost exactly a tenth of 1% of allmoney that the Treasury collected.\n8\n\nAnd that means – brace yourself – had there been roughly 1,000 taxpayers in the U.S.\nmatching Berkshire’s payments, no other businesses nor any of the country’s 131 millionhouseholds would have needed to pay anytaxes to the federal government. Not a dime.\n************\nMillions, billions, trillions – we all know the words, but the sums involved are almost\nimpossible to comprehend. Let’s put physical dimensions to the numbers:\n If you convert $1 million into newly-printed $100 bills, you will have a stack that reaches\nyour chest.\n Perform the same exercise with $1 billion – this is getting exciting! – and the stack reaches\nabout\n3⁄4of a mile into the sky.\n Finally, imagine piling up $32 billion, the total of Berkshire’s 2012-21 federal income tax\npayments. Now the stack grows to more than 21 miles in height, about three times the levelat which commercial airplanes usually cruise.\nWhen it comes to federal taxes, individuals who own Berkshire can unequivocally state “I\ngave at the office.”\n************\nAt Berkshire we hope and expect to pay much more in taxes during the next decade. We\nowe the country no less: America’s dynamism has made a huge contribution to whatever successBerkshire has achieved – a contribution Berkshire will always need. We count on the American\nTailwind and, though it has been becalmed from time to time, its propelling force has alwaysreturned.\nI have been investing for 80 years – more than one-third of our country’s lifetime. Despite\nour citizens’ penchant – almost enthusiasm – for self-criticism and self-doubt, I have yet to see atime when it made sense to make a long-term bet against America. And I doubt very much thatany reader of this letter will have a different experience in the future.\nNothing Beats Having a Great Partner\nCharlie and I think pretty much alike. But what it takes me a page to explain, he sums up\nin a sentence. His version, moreover, is always more clearly reasoned and also moreartfully – some might add bluntly – stated.\nHere are a few of his thoughts, many lifted from a very recent podcast:\n The world is full of foolish gamblers, and they will not do as well as the patient investor.\n If you don’t see the world the way it is, it’s like judging something through a distorted lens. All I want to know is where I’m going to die, so I’ll never go there. And a related thought:\nEarly on, write your desired obituary – and then behave accordingly.\n If you don’t care whether you are rational or not, you won’t work on it. Then you will stay\nirrational and get lousy results.\n9\n\n Patience can be learned. Having a long attention span and the ability to concentrate on one\nthing for a long time is a huge advantage.\n You can learn a lot from dead people. Read of the deceased you admire and detest. Don’t bail away in a sinking boat if you can swim to one that is seaworthy. A great company keeps working after you are not; a mediocre company won’t do that. Warren and I don’t focus on the froth of the market. We seek out good long-term\ninvestments and stubbornly hold them for a long time.\n Ben Graham said, “Day to day, the stock market is a voting machine; in the long term it’s\na weighing machine.” If you keep making something more valuable, then some wise personis going to notice it and start buying.\n There is no such thing as a 100% sure thing when investing. Thus, the use of leverage is\ndangerous. A string of wonderful numbers times zero will always equal zero. Don’t counton getting rich twice.\n You don’t, however, need to own a lot of things in order to get rich. You have to keep learning if you want to become a great investor. When the world changes,\nyoumust change.\n Warren and I hated railroad stocks for decades, but the world changed and finally the\ncountry had four huge railroads of vital importance to the American economy. We wereslow to recognize the change, but better late than never.\n Finally, Iwill add two short sentences by Charlie that have been his decision-clinchers for\ndecades: “Warren, think more about it. You’re smart and I’m right.”\nAnd so it goes. I never have a phone call with Charlie without learning something. And,\nwhile he makes me think, he also makes me laugh.\n************\nI will add to Charlie’s list a rule of my own: Find a very smart high-grade\npartner – preferably slightly older than you – and then listen very carefully to what he says.\nA Family Gathering in Omaha\nCharlie and I are shameless. Last year, at our first shareholder get-together in three years,\nwe greeted you with our usual commercial hustle.\nFrom the opening bell, we went straight for your wallet. In short order, our See’s kiosk\nsold you eleven tons of nourishing peanut brittle and chocolates. In our P.T. Barnum pitch, we\npromised you longevity. After all, what else but candy from See’s could account for Charlie andme making it to 99 and 92?\nI know you can’t wait to hear the specifics of last year’s hustle.On Friday, the doors were open from noon until 5 p.m., and our candy counters rang up\n2,690 individual sales. On Saturday, See’s registered an additional 3,931 transactions between7 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., despite the fact that 6\n1⁄2of the 91⁄2operating hours occurred while our movie\nand the question-and-answer session were limiting commercial traffic.\n10\n\nDo the math: See’s rang up about 10 sales per minute during its prime operating time\n(racking up $400,309 of volume during the two days), with all the goods purchased at a singlelocation selling products that haven’t been materially altered in 101 years. What worked for See’sin the days of Henry Ford’s model T works now.\n************\nCharlie, I, and the entire Berkshire bunch look forward to seeing you in Omaha on\nMay 5-6. We will have a good time and so will you.\nFebruary 25, 2023 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board\n11",

    "text": "Charlie Munger – The Architect of Berkshire Hathaway  \nCharlie Munger died on November 28, just 33 days before his 100th birthday. \nThough born and raised in Omaha, he spent 80% of his life domiciled \nelsewhere. Consequently, it was not until 1959 when he was 35 that I first met him. In 1962, he decided that he should take up money management. \nThree years later he told me – correctly! – that I had made a dumb decision in \nbuying control of Berkshire. But, he assured me, since I had already made the move, \nhe would tell me how to correct my mistake. \nIn what I next relate, bear in mind that Charlie and his family did not have a \ndime invested in the small investing partnership that I was then managing and whose money I had used for the Berkshire purchase. Moreover, neither of us expected that Charlie would ever  own a share of Berkshire stock. \nNevertheless, Charlie, in 1965, promptly advised me: “Warren, forget about \never buying another company like Berkshire. But now that you control Berkshire, add to it wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up buying fair businesses at wonderful prices. In other words, abandon everything you learned from your hero, Ben Graham. It works but only when practiced at small scale.” With much back-sliding I subsequently followed his instructions. \nMany years later, Charlie became my partner in running Berkshire and, \nrepeatedly, jerked me back to sanity when my old habits surfaced. Until his death, he continued in this role and together we, along with those who early on invested with us, ended up far better off than Charlie and I had ever dreamed possible. \nIn reality, Charlie was the “architect” of the present Berkshire, and I acted as \nthe “general contractor” to carry out the day-by-day construction of his vision. \nCharlie never sought to take credit for his role as creator but instead let me \ntake the bows and receive the accolades. In a way his relationship with me was part older brother, part loving father. Even when he knew he was right, he gave me the reins, and when I blundered he never – never  –reminded me of my mistake. \nIn the physical world, great buildings are linked to their architect while those \nwho had poured the concrete or installed the windows are soon forgotten. Berkshire has become a great company. Though I have long been in charge of the construction crew; Charlie  should forever  be credited with being the architect. \n2 \n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. \nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: \nBerkshire has more than three million shareholder accounts. I am charged with writing a \nletter every year that will be useful to this diverse and ever-changing group of owners, many of whom wish to learn more about their investment. \nCharlie Munger, for decades my partner in managing Berkshire, viewed this obligation \nidentically and would expect me to communicate with you this year in the regular manner. He and I were of one mind regarding our responsibilities to Berkshire shareholders. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nWriters find it useful to picture the reader they seek, and often they are hoping to attract a \nmass audience. At Berkshire, we have a more limited target: investors who trust Berkshire with their savings without any expectation of resale (resembling in attitude people who save in order to buy a farm or rental property rather than people who prefer using their excess funds to purchase lottery tickets or “hot” stocks). \nOver the years, Berkshire has attracted an unusual number of such “lifetime” shareholders \nand their heirs. We cherish their presence and believe they are entitled to hear every year both the good and bad news, delivered directly from their CEO and not from an investor-relations officer \nor communications consultant forever serving up optimism and syrupy mush. \nIn visualizing the owners that Berkshire  seeks, I am lucky to have the perfect mental model, \nmy sister, Bertie. Let me introduce her. \nFor openers, Bertie is smart, wise and likes to challenge my thinking. We have never, \nhowever, had a shouting match or anything close to a ruptured relationship. We never will. \nFurthermore, Bertie, and her three daughters as well, have a large portion of their savings \nin Berkshire shares. Their ownership spans decades, and every year Bertie will read what I have to say. My job is to anticipate her questions and give her honest answers. \n3 \n\nBertie, like most of you, understands many accounting terms, but she is not ready for a \nCPA exam. She follows business news – reading four newspapers daily – but doesn’t consider herself an economic expert. She is sensible – very sensible – instinctively knowing that pundits \nshould always  be ignored. After all, if she could reliably predict tomorrow’s winners, would she \nfreely share her valuable insights and thereby increase competitive buying? That would be like finding gold and then handing a map to the neighbors showing its location. \nBertie understands the power – for good or bad – of incentives, the weaknesses of humans, \nthe “tells” that can be recognized when observing human behavior. She knows who is “selling” and who can be trusted. In short, she is nobody’s fool. \nSo, what would interest Bertie this year? \nOperating Results, Fact and Fiction \nLet’s begin with the numbers. The official  annual report begins on K-1 and extends for 124 \npages. It is filled with a vast amount of information – some important, some trivial. \nAmong its disclosures many owners, along with financial reporters, will focus on page \nK-72. There, they will find the proverbial “bottom line” labeled “Net earnings (loss).” The numbers read $90 billion for 2021, ($23 billion) for 2022 and $96 billion for 2023. \nWhat in the world is going on? You seek guidance and are told that the procedures for calculating these “earnings” are \npromulgated by a sober and credentialed Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), mandated by a dedicated and hard-working Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and audited by the world-class professionals at Deloitte & Touche (“D&T”). On page K-67, D&T pulls no punches: “In our opinion, the financial statements . . . . . present fairly, in all material  respects \n(italics mine), the financial position of the Company . . . . . and the results of its operations . . . . . for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 . . . . .” \nSo sanctified, this worse-than-useless “net income” figure quickly gets transmitted \nthroughout the world via the internet and media. All parties believe they have done their job – and, legally, they have. \nWe, however, are left uncomfortable. At Berkshire, our view is that “earnings” should be a \nsensible concept that Bertie will find somewhat useful – but only  as a starting point  – in \nevaluating a business. Accordingly, Berkshire also reports to Bertie and you what we call \n“operating earnings.” Here is the story they tell: $27.6 billion for 2021; $30.9 billion for 2022 and \n$37.4 billion for 2023. \n4 \n\nThe primary  difference between the mandated figures and the ones Berkshire prefers is that \nwe exclude unrealized capital gains or losses that at times can exceed $5 billion a day . Ironically, \nour preference was pretty much the rule until 2018, when the “improvement” was mandated. Galileo’s experience, several centuries ago, should have taught us not to mess with mandates from on high. But, at Berkshire, we can be stubborn. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nMake no mistake about the significance of capital gains: I expect them to be a very \nimportant component of Berkshire’s value accretion during the decades ahead. Why else would we commit huge dollar amounts of your money (and Bertie’s) to marketable equities just as I have been doing with my own funds throughout my investing lifetime? \nI can’t remember a period since March 11, 1942 – the date of my first stock purchase – that \nI have not had a majority of my net worth in equities, U.S.-based  equities. And so far, so good. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below 100 on that fateful day in 1942 when I “pulled the trigger.” I was down about $5 by the time school was out. Soon, things turned around and now that index hovers around 38,000. America has been a terrific country for investors. All they have needed to do is sit quietly, listening to no one. \nIt is more than silly, however, to make judgments about Berkshire’s investment value based \non “earnings” that incorporate the capricious day-by-day  and, yes, even year-by-year movements \nof the stock market. As Ben Graham taught me, “In the short run the market acts as a voting machine; in the long run it becomes a weighing machine.” \nWhat We Do \nOur goal at Berkshire is simple: We want to own either all or a portion of businesses that \nenjoy good economics that are fundamental and enduring. Within capitalism, some businesses will flourish for a very long time while others will prove to be sinkholes. It’s harder than you would think to predict which will be the winners and losers. And those who tell you they know the answer are usually either self-delusional or snake-oil salesmen. \nAt Berkshire, we particularly favor the rare enterprise that can deploy additional  capital at \nhigh returns in the future. Owning only one of these companies – and simply sitting tight – can deliver wealth almost beyond measure. Even heirs to such a holding can – ugh! – sometimes live a lifetime of leisure. \nWe also hope these favored businesses are run by able and trustworthy managers, though \nthat is a more difficult judgment to make, however, and Berkshire has had its share of disappointments. \n5 \n\nIn 1863, Hugh McCulloch, the first Comptroller of the United States, sent a letter to all \nnational banks. His instructions included this warning: “Never deal with a rascal under the expectation that you can prevent him from cheating you.” Many bankers who thought they could “manage” the rascal problem have learned the wisdom of Mr. McCulloch’s advice – and I have as well. People are not that easy to read. Sincerity and empathy can easily be faked. That is as true now as it was in 1863. \nThis combination of the two necessities I’ve described for acquiring businesses has for \nlong been our goal in purchases and, for a while, we had an abundance of candidates to evaluate. If I missed one – and I missed plenty – another always came along. \nThose days are long behind us; size did us in, though increased competition for purchases \nwas also a factor. \nBerkshire now has – by far  – the largest GAAP net worth recorded by any American \nbusiness. Record operating income and a strong stock market led to a yearend figure of $561 billion. The total GAAP net worth for the other 499 S&P companies – a who’s who of American \nbusiness – was $8.9 trillion in 2022. (The 2023 number for the S&P has not yet been tallied but is unlikely to materially exceed $9.5 trillion.) \nBy this measure, Berkshire now occupies nearly 6% of the universe in which it operates. \nDoubling our huge base is simply not possible within, say, a five-year period, particularly because we are highly averse to issuing shares (an act that immediately juices net worth). \nThere remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the \nneedle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others. Some we can value; some we can’t. And, if we can, they have to be attractively priced. Outside the U.S., there are essentially no candidates that are meaningful  options for capital deployment at Berkshire. All \nin all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance. \nNevertheless, managing Berkshire is mostly fun and always interesting. On the positive \nside, after 59 years of assemblage, the company now owns either a portion or 100% of various businesses that, on a weighted basis, have somewhat better prospects than exist at most large American companies. By both luck and pluck, a few huge winners have emerged from a great many dozens of decisions. And we now have a small cadre of long-time managers who never muse about going elsewhere and who regard 65 as just another birthday. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nBerkshire benefits from an unusual constancy and clarity of purpose. While we emphasize \ntreating our employees, communities and suppliers well – who wouldn’t  wish to do so? – our \nallegiance will always  be to our country and our shareholders. We never forget that, though your \nmoney is comingled  with ours, it does not belong  to us. \n6 \n\nWith that focus, and with our present mix of businesses, Berkshire should  do a bit better \nthan the average American corporation and, more important, should  also operate with materially \nless risk of permanent loss of capital. Anything beyond “slightly better,” though, is wishful thinking. This modest aspiration wasn’t the case when Bertie went all-in on Berkshire – but it is now. \nOur Not-So-Secret Weapon \nOccasionally, markets and/or the economy will cause stocks and bonds of some large and \nfundamentally good businesses to be strikingly mispriced. Indeed, markets can – and will – unpredictably seize up or even vanish  as they did for four months in 1914 and for a few days \nin 2001. If you believe that American investors are now more stable than in the past, think back to September 2008. Speed of communication and the wonders of technology facilitate  instant \nworldwide paralysis, and we have come a long way since smoke signals. Such instant panics won’t happen often – but they will happen. \nBerkshire’s ability to immediately respond to market seizures with both huge sums and \ncertainty of performance may offer us an occasional large-scale opportunity. Though the stock \nmarket is massively larger than it was in our early years, today’s active  participants are neither \nmore emotionally stable nor better taught than when I was in school. For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young. The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupants. \nOne fact of financial life should never be forgotten. Wall Street – to use the term in its \nfigurative sense – would like its customers to make money, but what truly causes its denizens’ \njuices to flow is feverish activity. At such times, whatever foolishness can be marketed will be \nvigorously marketed – not by everyone but always by someone. \nOccasionally, the scene turns ugly. The politicians then become enraged; the most flagrant \nperpetrators of misdeeds slip away, rich and unpunished; and your friend next door becomes bewildered, poorer and sometimes vengeful. Money, he learns, has trumped morality. \nOne investment rule at Berkshire has not and will not change: Never  risk permanent loss \nof capital. Thanks to the American tailwind and the power of compound interest, the arena in which we operate has been – and will be – rewarding if you make a couple of good decisions during a \nlifetime and avoid serious mistakes. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nI believe Berkshire can handle financial  disasters of a magnitude beyond any heretofore \nexperienced. This ability is one we will not relinquish. When economic upsets occur, as they will, Berkshire’s goal will be to function as an asset  to the country – just as it was in a very minor way \nin 2008-9 – and to help extinguish  the financial fire rather than to be among the many companies \nthat, inadvertently or otherwise, ignited the conflagration. \n7 \n\nOur goal is realistic. Berkshire’s strength comes from its Niagara of diverse earnings \ndelivered after  interest costs, taxes and substantial charges for depreciation and amortization \n(“EBITDA” is a banned measurement at Berkshire). We also operate with minimal requirements for cash, even if the country encounters a prolonged period of global economic weakness, fear and near-paralysis. \nBerkshire does not currently pay dividends, and its share repurchases are 100% \ndiscretionary. Annual debt maturities are never material. \nYour company also holds a cash and U.S. Treasury bill  position far in excess of what \nconventional wisdom deems necessary. During the 2008 panic, Berkshire generated  cash from \noperations and did not rely in any manner on commercial paper, bank lines or debt markets. We did not predict the time of an economic paralysis but we were always prepared  for one. \nExtreme fiscal conservatism is a corporate pledge we make to those who have joined us in \nownership of Berkshire. In most years – indeed in most decades – our caution will likely prove to be unneeded behavior – akin to an insurance policy on a fortress-like building thought  to be \nfireproof. But Berkshire does not want to inflict permanent financial damage – quotational \nshrinkage for extended periods can’t be avoided – on Bertie or any of the individuals who have \ntrusted us with their savings. \nBerkshire is built to last. \nNon-controlled Businesses That Leave Us Comfortable \nLast year I mentioned two of Berkshire’s long-duration partial-ownership \npositions – Coca-Cola and American Express. These are not huge commitments like our Apple position. Each only accounts for 4-5% of Berkshire’s GAAP net worth. But they are meaningful assets and also illustrate our thought processes. \nAmerican Express began operations in 1850, and Coca-Cola was launched in an Atlanta \ndrug store in 1886. (Berkshire is not big on newcomers.) Both companies tried expanding into \nunrelated areas over the years and both found little success in these attempts. In the past – but definitely  not now – both were even mismanaged. \nBut each was hugely successful in its base business, reshaped here and there as conditions \ncalled for. And, crucially, their products “traveled.” Both Coke and AMEX became recognizable names worldwide as did their core products, and the consumption of liquids and the need for \nunquestioned financial trust are timeless essentials of our world. \n8 \n\nDuring 2023, we did not buy or sell a share of either AMEX or Coke – extending our own \nRip Van Winkle slumber that has now lasted well over two decades. Both companies again rewarded our inaction last year by increasing their earnings and dividends. Indeed, our share of AMEX earnings  in 2023 considerably exceeded the $1.3 billion cost of our long-ago purchase. \nBoth AMEX and Coke will almost certainly increase their dividends in 2024 – about 16% \nin the case of AMEX – and we will most certainly leave our holdings untouched throughout the \nyear. Could I create a better worldwide business than these two enjoy? As Bertie will tell \nyou: “No way.” \nThough Berkshire did not purchase shares of either company in 2023, your indirect \nownership of both Coke and AMEX increased a bit last year because of share repurchases we made at Berkshire. Such repurchases work to increase your participation in every  asset that Berkshire \nowns. To this obvious but often overlooked truth, I add my usual caveat: All stock repurchases \nshould be price-dependent. What is sensible at a discount to business-value becomes stupid if done at a premium. \nThe lesson from Coke and AMEX? When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with \nit. Patience  pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that \nare inevitable. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nThis year, I would like to describe two other investments that we expect to maintain \nindefinitely. Like Coke and AMEX, these commitments are not huge relative to our resources. They are worthwhile, however, and we were able to increase both positions during 2023. \nAt yearend, Berkshire owned 27.8% of Occidental Petroleum’s common shares and also \nowned warrants that, for more than five years, give us the option  to materially increase our \nownership at a fixed price. Though we very much like our ownership, as well as the option, Berkshire has no interest in purchasing or managing Occidental. We particularly like its vast oil and gas holdings in the United States, as well as its leadership in carbon-capture initiatives, though the economic feasibility of this technique has yet to be proven. Both of these activities are very much in our country’s interest. \nNot so long ago, the U.S. was woefully dependent on foreign oil, and carbon capture had \nno meaningful constituency. Indeed, in 1975, U.S. production was eight million barrels of oil-equivalent per day (“BOEPD”), a level far short of the country’s needs. From the favorable energy position that facilitated the U.S. mobilization in World War II, the country had retreated to become heavily dependent on foreign – potentially unstable – suppliers. Further declines in oil production were predicted along with future increases in usage. \n9 \n\nFor a long time, the pessimism appeared to be correct, with production falling to five \nmillion BOEPD by 2007. Meanwhile, the U.S. government created a Strategic Petroleum Reserve (“SPR”) in 1975 to alleviate – though not come close to eliminating – this erosion of American self-sufficiency. \nAnd then – Hallelujah! – shale economics became feasible in 2011, and our energy \ndependency ended. Now, U.S. production is more than 13 million BOEPD, and OPEC no longer has the upper hand. Occidental itself has annual U.S. oil production that each year comes close to matching the entire inventory of the SPR. Our country would be very – very – nervous today if \ndomestic production had remained at five million BOEPD, and it found itself hugely dependent on non-U.S. sources. At that level, the SPR would have been emptied within months if foreign oil became unavailable. \nUnder Vicki Hollub’s leadership, Occidental is doing the right things for both its country \nand its owners. No one knows what oil prices will do over the next month, year, or decade. But \nVicki does know how to separate oil from rock, and that’s an uncommon talent, valuable to her shareholders and to her country. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nAdditionally, Berkshire continues to hold its passive and long-term interest in five very \nlarge Japanese companies, each of which operates in a highly-diversified manner somewhat similar to the way Berkshire itself is run. We increased our holdings in all five last year after Greg Abel and I made a trip to Tokyo to talk with their managements. \nBerkshire now owns about 9% of each of the five. (A minor point: Japanese companies \ncalculate outstanding shares in a manner different from the practice in the U.S.) Berkshire has also pledged to each company that it will not purchase shares that will take our holdings beyond 9.9%. Our cost for the five totals ¥1.6 trillion, and the yearend market value of the five was ¥2.9 trillion. However, the yen has weakened in recent years and our yearend unrealized gain in dollars was 61% or $8 billion. \nNeither Greg nor I believe we can forecast market prices of major currencies. We also don’t \nbelieve we can hire anyone with this ability. Therefore, Berkshire has financed most of its Japanese position with the proceeds from ¥1.3 trillion of bonds. This debt has been very well-received in Japan, and I believe Berkshire has more yen-denominated debt outstanding than any other American company. The weakened yen has produced a yearend gain for Berkshire of $1.9 billion, a sum that, pursuant to GAAP rules, has periodically been recognized in income over the 2020-23 period. \nIn certain important ways, all five companies – Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and \nSumitomo – follow shareholder-friendly policies that are much superior to those customarily practiced in the U.S. Since we began our Japanese purchases, each  of the five has reduced the \nnumber of its outstanding shares at attractive prices . \n10 \n\nMeanwhile, the managements of all five companies have been far less aggressive about \ntheir own compensation than is typical in the United States. Note as well that each of the five is applying only about \n1⁄3 of its earnings to dividends. The large sums the five retain are used both to \nbuild their many businesses and, to a lesser degree, to repurchase shares. Like Berkshire, the five companies are reluctant to issue  shares. \nAn additional benefit for Berkshire is the possibility that our investment may lead to \nopportunities for us to partner around the world with five large, well-managed and well-respected companies. Their interests are far more broad than ours. And, on their side, the Japanese CEOs have the comfort of knowing that Berkshire will always possess huge liquid resources that can be instantly available for such partnerships, whatever their size may be. \nOur Japanese purchases began on July 4, 2019. Given Berkshire’s present size, building \npositions through open-market purchases takes a lot of patience and an extended period of “friendly” prices. The process is like turning a battleship. That is an important disadvantage which we did not face in our early days at Berkshire. \nThe Scorecard in 2023 \nEvery quarter we issue a press release that reports our summarized operating earnings (or \nloss) in a manner similar to what is shown below. Here is the full-year compilation: \n (in $ millions) \n 2023 2022 \nInsurance-underwriting ...................... $ 5,428 $ (30) \nInsurance-investment income ................. 9,567 6,484 \nRailroad .................................. 5,087 5,946 \nUtilities and energy ......................... 2,331 3,904 \nOther businesses and miscellaneous items ....... 14,937 14,549 \nOperating earnings .......................... $37,350 $30,853 \nAt Berkshire’s annual gathering on May 6, 2023, I presented the first quarter’s results \nwhich had been released early that morning. I followed with a short summary of the outlook for the full year: (1) most of our non-insurance  businesses faced lower earnings in 2023; (2) that \ndecline would be cushioned by decent results at our two largest non-insurance businesses, BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) which, combined, had accounted for more than 30% of operating earnings in 2022; (3) our investment income was certain  to materially grow because the \nhuge U.S. Treasury bill position held by Berkshire had finally begun to pay us far more than the pittance we had been receiving and (4) insurance would likely do well, both because its underwriting earnings are not correlated to earnings elsewhere in the economy and, beyond that, property-casualty insurance prices had strengthened. \n11 \n\nInsurance came through as expected. I erred, however, in my expectations for both BNSF \nand BHE. Let’s take a look at each. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nRail is essential to America’s economic future. It is clearly the most efficient \nway – measured by cost, fuel usage and carbon intensity – of moving heavy materials to distant destinations. Trucking wins for short hauls, but many goods that Americans need must  travel to \ncustomers many hundreds or even several thousands of miles away. The country can’t run without rail, and the industry’s capital needs will always be huge. Indeed, compared to most American businesses, railroads eat capital. \nBNSF is the largest of six major rail systems that blanket North America. Our railroad \ncarries its 23,759 miles of main track, 99 tunnels, 13,495 bridges, 7,521 locomotives and assorted other fixed assets at $70 billion on its balance sheet. But my guess is that it would cost at least $500 billion to replicate those assets and decades  to complete the job. \nBNSF must annually spend more than its depreciation charge to simply maintain  its present \nlevel of business. This reality is bad for owners, whatever the industry in which they have invested, but it is particularly disadvantageous in capital-intensive industries. \nAt BNSF, the outlays in excess  of GAAP depreciation charges since our purchase 14 years \nago have totaled a staggering $22 billion or more than $1\n1⁄2 billion annually. Ouch! That sort of \ngap means BNSF dividends paid to Berkshire, its owner, will regularly fall  considerably short of \nBNSF’s reported earnings unless we regularly increase the railroad’s debt. And that we do not intend to do. \nConsequently, Berkshire is receiving an acceptable return on its purchase price, though less \nthan it might appear, and also a pittance on the replacement value of the property. That’s no surprise to me or Berkshire’s board of directors. It explains why we could buy BNSF in 2010 at a small fraction of its replacement value. \nNorth America’s rail system moves huge quantities of coal, grain, autos, imported and \nexported goods, etc. one-way  for long distances and those trips often create a revenue problem for \nback-hauls. Weather conditions are extreme and frequently hamper or even stymie the utilization of track, bridges and equipment. Flooding can be a nightmare. None of this is a surprise. While I sit in an always-comfortable office, railroading is an outdoor activity with many employees working under trying and sometimes dangerous conditions. \nAn evolving problem is that a growing percentage of Americans are not looking for the \ndifficult, and often lonely, employment conditions inherent in some rail operations. Engineers must deal with the fact that among an American population of 335 million, some forlorn or mentally-disturbed Americans are going to elect suicide by lying in front of a 100-car, extraordinarily heavy train that can’t be stopped in less than a mile or more. Would you like to be \nthe helpless engineer? This trauma happens about once a day in North America; it is far more common in Europe and will always be with us. \n12 \n\nWage negotiations in the rail industry can end up in the hands of the President and \nCongress. Additionally, American railroads are required  to carry many dangerous products every \nday that the industry would much rather avoid. The words “common carrier” define railroad responsibilities. \nLast year BNSF’s earnings declined more than I expected, as revenues fell. Though fuel \ncosts also fell, wage increases, promulgated in Washington, were far beyond the country’s inflation goals. This differential may recur in future negotiations. \nThough BNSF carries more freight and spends more on capital expenditures than any of \nthe five other major North American railroads, its profit margins have slipped relative to all five since our purchase. I believe that our vast service territory is second to none and that therefore our margin comparisons can and should improve. \nI am particularly proud of both BNSF’s contribution to the country and the people who \nwork in sub-zero outdoor jobs in North Dakota and Montana winters to keep America’s commercial arteries open. Railroads don’t get much attention when they are working but, were they unavailable, the void would be noticed immediately throughout America. \nA century from now, BNSF will continue to be a major asset of the country and of \nBerkshire. You can count on that. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nOur second and even more severe earnings disappointment last year occurred at BHE. Most  \nof its large electric-utility businesses, as well as its extensive gas pipelines, performed about as expected. But the regulatory climate in a few states has raised the specter of zero profitability or even bankruptcy (an actual outcome at California’s largest utility and a current threat in Hawaii). In such jurisdictions, it is difficult to project both earnings and asset values in what was once regarded as among the most stable industries in America. \nFor more than a century, electric utilities raised huge sums to finance their growth through \na state-by-state promise of a fixed return on equity (sometimes with a small bonus for superior performance). With this approach, massive investments were made for capacity that would likely be required a few years down the road. That forward-looking regulation reflected the reality that utilities build generating and transmission assets that often take many years to construct. BHE’s extensive multi-state transmission project in the West was initiated in 2006 and remains some years from completion. Eventually, it will serve 10 states comprising 30% of the acreage in the continental United States. \nWith this model employed by both private and public-power systems, the lights stayed on, \neven if population growth or industrial demand exceeded expectations. The “margin of safety” approach seemed sensible to regulators, investors and the public. Now, the fixed-but-satisfactory-return pact has been broken in a few states, and investors are becoming apprehensive that such ruptures may spread. Climate change adds to their worries. Underground transmission may be required but who, a few decades ago, wanted to pay the staggering costs for such construction? \n13 \n\nAt Berkshire, we have made a best estimate for the amount of losses that have occurred. \nThese costs arose from forest fires, whose frequency and intensity have increased – and will likely continue to increase – if convective storms become more frequent. \nIt will be many years until we know the final tally from BHE’s forest-fire losses and can \nintelligently make decisions about the desirability of future investments in vulnerable western states. It remains to be seen whether the regulatory environment will change elsewhere. \nOther electric utilities may face survival problems resembling those of Pacific Gas and \nElectric and Hawaiian Electric. A confiscatory resolution of our present problems would obviously be a negative for BHE, but both that company and Berkshire itself are structured to survive negative surprises. We regularly get these in our insurance business, where our basic product is risk assumption, and they will occur elsewhere. Berkshire can sustain financial surprises but we will not knowingly  throw good money after bad. \nWhatever the case at Berkshire, the final result for the utility industry may be ominous: \nCertain utilities might no longer attract the savings of American citizens and will be forced to adopt the public-power model. Nebraska made this choice in the 1930s and there are many public-power operations throughout the country. Eventually, voters, taxpayers and users will decide which model they prefer. \nWhen the dust settles, America’s power needs and the consequent capital expenditure will \nbe staggering. I did not anticipate or even consider the adverse developments in regulatory returns and, along with Berkshire’s two partners at BHE, I made a costly mistake in not doing so. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nEnough about problems: Our insurance business performed exceptionally well last year, \nsetting records in sales, float and underwriting profits. Property-casualty insurance (“P/C”) provides the core of Berkshire’s well-being and growth. We have been in the business for 57 years and despite our nearly 5,000-fold  increase in volume – from $17 million to $83  billion  – we have \nmuch room to grow. \nBeyond that, we have learned – too often, painfully – a good deal about what types of \ninsurance business and what sort of people to avoid . The most important lesson is that our \nunderwriters can be thin, fat, male, female, young, old, foreign or domestic. But they can’t be \noptimists at the office, however desirable that quality may generally be in life. \nSurprises  in the P/C business – which can occur decades after six-month or one-year \npolicies have expired – are almost always negative. The industry’s accounting is designed to recognize this reality, but estimation mistakes can be huge. And when charlatans are involved, detection is often both slow and costly. Berkshire will always attempt to be accurate in its estimates of future loss payments but inflation – both monetary and the “legal” variety – is a wild card. \n14 \n\nI’ve told the story of our insurance operations so many times that I will simply direct \nnewcomers to page 18. Here, I will only repeat that our position would not be what it is if Ajit Jain had not joined Berkshire in 1986. Before that lucky day – aside from an almost unbelievably wonderful experience with GEICO that began early in 1951 and will never end – I was largely wandering in the wilderness, as I struggled to build our insurance operation. \nAjit’s achievements since joining Berkshire have been supported by a large cast of \nhugely-talented insurance executives in our various P/C operations. Their names and faces are unknown to most of the press and the public. Berkshire’s lineup of managers, however, is to P/C insurance what Cooperstown’s honorees are to baseball. \nBertie, you can feel good about the fact that you own a piece of an incredible P/C operation \nthat now operates worldwide with unmatched financial resources, reputation and talent. It carried the day in 2023. \nWhat is it with Omaha? \nCome to Berkshire’s annual gathering on May 4, 2024. On stage you will see the three \nmanagers who now bear the prime responsibilities for steering your company. What, you may wonder, do the three have in common? They certainly don’t look alike. Let’s dig deeper. \nGreg Abel, who runs all non-insurance operations for Berkshire – and in all respects is \nready to be CEO of Berkshire tomorrow – was born and raised in Canada (he still plays hockey). In the 1990s, however, Greg lived for six years in Omaha just a few blocks away from me. During that period, I never met him. \nA decade or so earlier, Ajit Jain, who was born, raised and educated in India, lived with his \nfamily in Omaha only a mile or so from my home (where I’ve lived since 1958). Both Ajit and his wife, Tinku, have many Omaha friends, though it’s been more than three decades since they moved to New York (in order to be where much of the action in reinsurance takes place). \nMissing from the stage this year will be Charlie. He and I were both born in Omaha about \ntwo miles from where you will sit at our May get-together. In his first ten years, Charlie lived about a half-mile from where Berkshire has long maintained its office. Both Charlie and I spent our early years in Omaha public schools and were indelibly shaped by our Omaha childhood. We didn’t meet, however, until much later. (A footnote that may surprise you: Charlie lived under 15 of America’s 45 presidents. People refer to President Biden as #46, but that numbering counts Grover Cleveland as both #22 and #24 because his terms were not consecutive. America is a very young country.) \n15 \n\nMoving to the corporate level, Berkshire itself relocated in 1970 from its 81 years of \nresidence in New England to settle in Omaha, leaving its troubles behind and blossoming in its new home. \nAs a final punctuation point to the “Omaha Effect,” Bertie – yes that Bertie – spent her \nearly formative years in a middle-class neighborhood in Omaha and, many decades later, emerged as one of the country’s great investors. \nYou may be thinking that she put all of her money in Berkshire and then simply sat on it. \nBut that’s not true. After starting a family in 1956, Bertie was active financially for 20 years: holding bonds, putting \n1⁄3 of her funds in a publicly-held mutual fund and trading stocks with some \nfrequency. Her potential remained unnoticed. \nThen, in 1980, when 46, and independent of any urgings from her brother, Bertie decided \nto make her move. Retaining only the mutual fund and Berkshire, she made no new trades during \nthe next 43 years. During that period, she became very rich, even after making large philanthropic gifts (think nine figures). \nMillions of American investors could  have followed her reasoning which involved only \nthe common sense she had somehow absorbed as a child in Omaha. And, taking no chances, Bertie returns to Omaha every  May to be re-energized. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nSo what is going on? Is it Omaha’s water? Is it Omaha’s air? Is it some strange planetary \nphenomenon akin to that which has produced Jamaica’s sprinters, Kenya’s marathon runners, or Russia’s chess experts? Must we wait until AI someday yields the answer to this puzzle? \nKeep an open mind. Come to Omaha in May, inhale the air, drink the water and say “hi” \nto Bertie and her good-looking daughters. Who knows? There is no downside, and, in any event, you will have a good time and meet a huge crowd of friendly people. \nTo top things off, we will have available the new 4\nth edition of Poor Charlie’s Almanack. \nPick up a copy. Charlie’s wisdom will improve your life as it has mine. \nFebruary 24, 2024  Warren E.

    "text": "BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. \nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: \nThis letter comes to you as part of Berkshire’s annual report . As a public company, we \nare required to periodically tell you many specific facts and figures. \n“Report,” however, implies a greater responsibility. In addition to the mandated data, we \nbelieve we owe you additional commentary about what you own and how we think. Our goal is to communicate with you in a manner that we would wish you to use if our positions were reversed – that is, if you were Berkshire’s CEO while I and my family were passive investors, \ntrusting you with our savings. \nThis approach leads us to an annual recitation of both good and bad developments at the \nmany businesses you indirectly own through your Berkshire shares. When discussing problems at specific subsidiaries, we do, however, try to follow the advice Tom Murphy gave to me 60 years ago: “praise by name, criticize by category.” \nMistakes – Yes, We Make Them at Berkshire \nSometimes I’ve made mistakes in assessing the future economics of a business I’ve \npurchased for Berkshire – each a case of capital allocation gone wrong. That happens with both judgments about marketable equities – we view these as partial  ownership of businesses – and \nthe 100% acquisitions of companies. \nAt other times, I’ve made mistakes when assessing the abilities or fidelity of the \nmanagers Berkshire is hiring. The fidelity disappointments can hurt beyond their financial impact, a pain that can approach that of a failed marriage. \nA decent batting average in personnel decisions is all that can be hoped for. The cardinal \nsin is delaying the correction of mistakes or what Charlie Munger called “thumb-sucking.” Problems, he would tell me, cannot be wished away. They require action, however uncomfortable that may be. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nDuring the 2019-23 period, I have used the words “mistake” or “error” 16 times in my \nletters to you. Many other huge companies have  never  used either word over that span. Amazon, \nI should acknowledge, made some brutally candid observations in its 2021 letter. Elsewhere, it has generally been happy talk and pictures. \n1 \n\nI have also been a director of large public companies at which “mistake” or “wrong” were \nforbidden words at board meetings or analyst calls. That taboo, implying managerial perfection, always made me nervous (though, at times, ther e could be legal issues that make limited \ndiscussion advisable. We live in a very litigious society.) \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nAt 94, it won’t be long before Greg Abel replaces me as CEO and will be writing the \nannual letters. Greg shares the Berkshire creed that a “report” is what a Berkshire CEO annually owes to owners. And he also understands that if you start fooling your shareholders, you will soon believe your own baloney and be fooling yourself as well. \nPete Liegl – One of a Kind \nLet me pause to tell you the remarkable story of Pete Liegl, a man unknown to most \nBerkshire shareholders but one who contributed many billions to their aggregate wealth. Pete died in November, still working at 80. \nI first heard of Forest River – the Indiana company Pete founded and managed – on \nJune 21, 2005. On that day I received a letter from an  intermediary detailing relevant data about \nthe company, a recreational vehicle (“RV”) manufacturer. The writer said that Pete, the 100% owner of Forest River, specifically wanted to sell to Berkshire. He also told me the price that Pete expected to receive. I liked this no-nonsense approach. \nI did some checking with RV dealers, liked what I learned and arranged a June 28\nth \nmeeting in Omaha. Pete brought along his wife, Sharon, and daughter, Lisa. When we met, Pete \nassured me that he wanted to keep running the business but would feel more comfortable if he could assure financial security for his family. \nPete next mentioned that he owned some real estate that was leased to Forest River and \nhad not been covered in the June 21 letter. Within a few minutes, we arrived at a price for those assets as I expressed no need for appraisal by Berkshire but would simply accept his valuation. \nThen we arrived at the other point that needed clarity. I asked Pete what his compensation \nshould be, adding that whatever he said, I would accept. (This, I should add, is not an approach I \nrecommend for general use.) \nPete paused as his wife, daughter and I leaned forward. Then he surprised us: “Well, I \nlooked at Berkshire’s proxy statement and I wouldn’t want to make more than my boss, so pay me $100,000 per year.” After I picked myself off the floor, Pete added: “But we will earn X (he named a number) this year, and I would like an annual bonus of 10% of any earnings above what the company is now delivering.” I replied: “OK Pete, but if Forest River makes any significant \nacquisitions we will make an appropriate adjustment for the additional capital thus employed.” I didn’t define “appropriate” or “significant,” but those vague terms never caused a problem. \n2 \n\nThe four of us then went to dinner at Omaha’s Happy Hollow Club and lived happily \never after. During the next 19 years, Pete shot the lights out. No competitor came close to his performance. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nEvery company doesn’t have an easy-to-understand business and there are very few \nowners or managers like Pete. And, of course, I expect to make my share of mistakes about the businesses Berkshire buys and sometimes err in evaluating the sort of person with whom I’m dealing. \nBut I’ve also had many pleasant surprises in both the potential of the business as well as \nthe ability and fidelity of the manager. And our experience is that a single  winning decision can \nmake a breathtaking difference over time. (Think GEICO as a business decision, Ajit Jain as a managerial decision and my luck in finding Char lie Munger as a one-of-a-kind partner, personal \nadvisor and steadfast friend.) Mistakes fade away; winners can forever blossom. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nOne further point in our CEO selections: I never look at where a candidate has gone to \nschool. Never! \nOf course, there are great managers who attended the most famous schools. But there are \nplenty such as Pete who may have benefitted by attending a less prestigious institution or even by not bothering to finish school. Look at my frie nd, Bill Gates, who decided that it was far more \nimportant to get underway in an exploding industry that would change the world than it was to stick around for a parchment that he could hang on the wall. (Read his new book, Source Code .) \nNot long ago, I met – by phone – Jessica Toonkel, whose step-grandfather, Ben Rosner, \nlong ago ran a business for Charlie and me. Ben was a retailing genius and, in preparing for this report, I checked with Jessica to confirm Ben’s schooling, which I remembered as limited. Jessica’s reply: “Ben never went past 6\nth grade.” \nI was lucky enough to get an education at three fine universities. And I avidly believe in \nlifelong learning. I’ve observed, however, that a very large portion of business talent is innate with nature swamping nurture. \nPete Liegl was a natural. \n3 \n\nLast Year’s Performance \nIn 2024, Berkshire did better than I expected though 53% of our 189 operating \nbusinesses reported a decline  in earnings. We were aided by a predictable large gain in \ninvestment income as Treasury Bill yields impr oved and we substantially increased our holdings \nof these highly-liquid short-term securities. \nOur insurance business also delivered a major increase in earnings, led by the \nperformance of GEICO. In five years, Todd Combs has reshaped GEICO in a major way, increasing efficiency and bringing underwriting practices up to date. GEICO was a long-held gem that needed major repolishing, and Todd has worked tirelessly in getting the job done. Though not yet complete, the 2024 improvement was spectacular. \nIn general, property-casualty (“P/C”) insurance pricing strengthened during 2024, \nreflecting a major increase in damage from convective storms. Climate change may have been announcing its arrival. However, no “monster” event occurred during 2024. Someday, any day, a \ntruly staggering insurance loss will occur – and there is no guarantee that there will be only one per annum. \nThe P/C business is so central to Berkshire that it warrants a further discussion that \nappears later in this letter. \nBerkshire’s railroad and utility operations, our two largest businesses outside of \ninsurance, improved their aggregate earnings. Both, however, have much left to accomplish. \nLate in the year we increased our ownership of the utility operation from about 92% to \n100% at a cost of roughly $3.9 billion, of which $2.9 billion was paid in cash with a balance in Berkshire “B” shares. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nAll told, we recorded operating earnings  of $47.4 billion in 2024. We regularly – endlessly, \nsome readers may groan – emphasize this measure rather than the GAAP-mandated earnings that \nare reported on page K-68. \nOur measure excludes capital gains or losses on the stocks and bonds we own, whether \nrealized or unrealized. Over time, we think it highly likely that gains will prevail – why else would we buy these securities? – though the year-by-year numbers will swing wildly and unpredictably. Our horizon for such commitments is almost always far longer than a single year. In many, our thinking involves decades. These long-termers are the purchases that sometimes make the cash register ring like church bells. \n4 \n\nHere’s a breakdown of the 2023-24 earnings as we see them. All calculations are after \ndepreciation, amortization and income tax. EBITDA, a flawed favorite of Wall Street, is not for us. \n \n  (in $ millions) \n 2024 \n2023 \nInsurance-underwriting ..................... $  9,020 $ 5,428 \nInsurance-investment income ................ 13,670 9,567 \nBNSF ................................... 5,031 5,087 \nBerkshire Hathaway Energy ................. 3,730 2,331 \nOther controlled businesses ................. 13,072 13,362 \nNon-controlled businesses* ................. 1,519 1,750 \nOther** ................................. 1,395 (175) \nOperating earnings ........................ $47,437 $37,350 \n* Includes certain businesses in which Berkshire had between a 20% and 50% ownership \nsuch as Kraft Heinz, Occidental Petroleum and Berkadia. \n** Includes foreign currency exchange gains of approximately $1.1 billion in 2024 and \napproximately $211 million in 2023 produced by our usage of non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt. \nSurprise, Surprise! An Important American Record is Smashed \nSixty years ago, present management took control of Berkshire. That move was a \nmistake – my mistake – and one that plagued us for two decades . Charlie, I should emphasize, \nspotted my obvious error immediately: Though the price I paid for Berkshire looked  cheap, its \nbusiness – a large northern textile operation – was headed for extinction. \nThe U.S. Treasury, of all places, had already received silent warnings of Berkshire’s \ndestiny. In 1965, the company did not pay a dime of income tax, an embarrassment that had generally prevailed at the company for a decade . That sort of economic behavior may be \nunderstandable for glamorous startups, but it’s a blinking yellow light when it happens at a venerable pillar of American industry. Berkshire was headed for the ash can. \nFast forward 60 years and imagine the surprise at the Treasury when that same \ncompany – still operating under the name of Berkshire Hathaway – paid far more in corporate \nincome tax than the U.S. government had ever received from any company – even the American \ntech titans that commanded market values in the trillions . \nTo be precise, Berkshire last year made four payments to the IRS that totaled $26.8 \nbillion. That’s about 5% of what all of corporate America paid. (In addition, we paid sizable \namounts for income taxes to foreign governments and to 44 states.) \n5 \n\nNote one crucial factor allowing this record-shattering payment: Berkshire shareholders \nduring the same 1965-2024 period received only one cash dividend. On January 3, 1967, we disbursed our sole payment – $101,755 or 10¢ per A share. (I can’t remember why I suggested this action to Berkshire’s board of directors. Now it seems like a bad dream.) \nFor sixty years , Berkshire shareholders endorsed continuous reinvestment and that \nenabled the company to build its taxable income. Cash income-tax payments to the U.S. Treasury, miniscule in the first decade, now aggregate more than $101  billion . . . and counting. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nHuge numbers can be hard to visualize. Let me recast the $26.8 billion that we paid last \nyear. \nIf Berkshire had sent the Treasury a $1 million check every 20 minutes  throughout all of \n2024 – visualize 366 days and nights because 2024 was a leap year – we still would have owed \nthe federal government a significant sum at yearend. Indeed, it would be well into January before the Treasury would tell us that we could take a short breather, get some sleep, and prepare for our 2025 tax payments. \nWhere Your Money Is \nBerkshire’s equity activity is ambidextrous. In one hand we own control of many \nbusinesses, holding at least 80% of the investee’s shares. Generally, we own 100%. These 189 subsidiaries have similarities to marketable common stocks but are far from identical. The collection is worth many hundreds of billions and includes a few rare gems, many good-but-far-from-fabulous businesses and some laggards that have been disappointments. \nWe own nothing that is a major drag, but we have a number that I should not have purchased. \nIn the other  hand, we own a small percentage of a dozen or so very large and highly \nprofitable businesses with household names such as Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola and Moody’s. Many of these companies earn very high returns on the net tangible equity required for their operations. At yearend, our partial-ownership holdings were valued at $272 billion. Understandably, really outstanding businesses are very seldom offered in their entirety, but small \nfractions of these gems can be purchased Monday through Friday on Wall Street and, very occasionally, they sell at bargain prices. \nWe are impartial in our choice of equity vehicles, investing in either variety based upon \nwhere we can best deploy your (and my family’s) savings. Often, nothing looks compelling; very \ninfrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities. Greg has vividly shown his ability to act at such times as did Charlie. \n6 \n\nWith marketable equities, it is easier to change course when I make a mistake. \nBerkshire’s present size, it should be underscored, diminishe s this valuable option. We can’t \ncome and go on a dime. Sometimes a year or more is required to establish or divest an investment. Additionally, with ownership of minority positions we can’t change management if that action is needed or control what is done with capital flows if we are unhappy with the decisions being made. \nWith controlled companies, we can dictate these decisions, but we have far less flexibility \nin the disposition of mistakes. In reality, Berk shire almost never sells controlled businesses \nunless we face what we believe to be unending probl ems. An offset is that some business owners \nseek out Berkshire because of our steadfast behavior. Occasionally, that can be a decided plus for us. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nDespite what some commentators currently view as an extraordinary cash position at \nBerkshire, the great majority of your money remains in equities. That preference won’t change. While our ownership in marketable  equities moved downward last year from $354 billion to \n$272 billion, the value of our non-quoted controlled equities increased somewhat and remains far \ngreater than the value of the marketable  portfolio. \nBerkshire shareholders can rest assured that we will forever deploy a substantial majority \nof their money in equities – mostly American equities although many of these will have international operations of significance. Berkshire will never  prefer ownership of cash-equivalent \nassets over the ownership of good businesses, whether controlled or only partially owned. \nPaper money can see its value evaporate if fiscal folly prevails. In some countries, this \nreckless practice has become habitual, and, in our country’s short history, the U.S. has come close to the edge. Fixed-coupon bonds provide no protection against runaway currency. \nBusinesses, as well as individuals with desi red talents, however, will usually find a way \nto cope with monetary instability as long as their goods or services are desired by the country’s citizenry. So, too, with personal skills. Lacking such assets as athletic excellence, a wonderful voice, medical or legal skills or, for that matter, any special talents, I have had to rely on equities \nthroughout my life. In effect, I have depended on the success of American businesses and I will continue to do so. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nOne way or another, the sensible – better yet imaginative – deployment of savings by \ncitizens is required to propel an ever-growing societal output of desired goods and services. This system is called capitalism. It has its faults and abuses – in certain respects more egregious now than ever – but it also can work wonders unmatched by other economic systems. \nAmerica is Exhibit A. Our country’s progress over its mere 235 years of existence could \nnot have been imagined by even the most optimistic colonists in 1789, when the Constitution was adopted and the country’s energies were unleashed. \n7 \n\nTrue, our country in its infancy sometimes borrowed abroad to supplement our own \nsavings. But, concurrently, we needed many Americans to consistently save and then needed those savers or other Americans to wisely deploy the capital thus made available. If America had consumed all that it produced, the country would have been spinning its wheels. \nThe American process has not always been pretty – our country has forever had many \nscoundrels and promoters who seek to take advantage of those who mistakenly trust them with their savings. But even with such malfeasance – which remains in full force today – and also much deployment of capital that eventually floundered because of brutal competition or disruptive innovation, the savings of Americans has delivered a quantity and quality of output beyond the dreams of any colonist. \nFrom a base of only four million people – and despite a brutal internal war early on, \npitting one American against another – America changed the world in the blink of a celestial eye. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nIn a very minor way, Berkshire shareholders have participated in the American miracle by \nforegoing dividends, thereby electing to reinvest rather than consume. Originally, this reinvestment was tiny, almost meaningless, but  over time, it mushroomed, reflecting the mixture \nof a sustained culture of savings, combined with the magic of long-term compounding. \nBerkshire’s activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished. \nCompanies die for many reasons but, unlike the fate of humans, old age itself is not lethal. Berkshire today is far more youthful than it was in 1965. \nHowever , as Charlie and I have always acknowledged, Berkshire would not have \nachieved its results in any locale except America whereas America would have been every bit the success it has been if Berkshire had never existed. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nSo thank you, Uncle Sam. Someday your nieces and nephews at Berkshire hope to send \nyou even larger payments than we did in 2024. Spend it wisely. Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better. And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires  both wisdom and vigilance on \nyour part. \nProperty-Casualty Insurance \nP/C insurance continues to be Berkshire’s core business. The industry follows a financial \nmodel that is rare – very rare – among giant businesses. \nCustomarily, companies incur costs for labor, materials, inventories, plant and equipment, \netc. before  – or concurrently with – the sale of their products or services. Consequently, their \nCEOs have a good fix on knowing the cost of their product before  they sell it. If the selling price \nis less than its cost, managers soon learn they have a problem. Hemorrhaging cash is hard to ignore. \n8 \n\nWhen writing P/C insurance, we receive payment upfront and much later  learn what our \nproduct has cost us – sometimes a moment of truth that is delayed as much as 30 or more years. (We are still making substantial payments on asbest os exposures that occurred 50 or more years \nago.) \nThis mode of operations has the desirable effect of giving P/C insurers cash before \nthey incur most expenses but carries with it the risk that the company can be losing money – sometimes mountains of money – before the CEO and directors realize what is happening. \nCertain lines of insurance minimize this mismatch, such as crop insurance or hail damage \nin which losses are quickly reported, evaluated and paid. Other lines, however, can lead to executive and shareholder bliss as the company is going broke. Think coverages such as medical malpractice or product liability. In “long-tail” lines, a P/C insurer may report large but fictitious profits to its owners and regulators for many years – even decades. The accounting can be particularly dangerous if the CEO is an optimist or a crook. These possibilities are not fanciful: \nHistory reveals a large number of each species. \nIn recent decades, this “money-up-front, loss-payments-later” model has allowed \nBerkshire to invest large sums (“float”) while ge nerally delivering what we believe to be a small \nunderwriting profit. We make estimates for “surprises” and, so far, these estimates have been sufficient. \nWe are not deterred by the dramatic and growing loss payments sustained by our \nactivities. (As I write this, think wildfires.) It’s our job to price to absorb these and unemotionally take our lumps when surprises develop. It’s also our job to contest “runaway” verdicts, spurious \nlitigation and outright fraudulent behavior. \nUnder Ajit, our insurance operation has blossomed from an obscure Omaha-based \ncompany into a world leader, renowned for both its taste for risk and its Gibraltar-like financial strength. Moreover, Greg, our directors and I all have a very large investment in Berkshire in \nrelation to any compensation we receive. We do not use options or other one-sided forms of \ncompensation; if you lose money, so do we. This approach encourages caution but does not \nensure foresight. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nP/C insurance growth  is dependent on increased economic risk. No risk – no need for \ninsurance. \nThink back only 135 years when the world had no autos, trucks or airplanes. Now there \nare 300 million vehicles in the U.S. alone, a massive fleet causing huge damage daily. Property damage arising from hurricanes, tornadoes and wildfires is massive, growing and increasingly unpredictable in their patterns and eventual costs. \n9 \n\nIt would be foolish – make that madness – to write ten-year policies for these coverages, \nbut we believe one-year assumption of such risk s is generally manageable. If we change our \nminds, we will change the contracts we offer. Du ring my lifetime, auto insurers have generally \nabandoned one-year policies and switched to the six-month variety. This change reduced  float \nbut allowed more intelligent underwriting. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nNo private insurer has the willingness to take on the amount of risk that Berkshire can \nprovide. At times, this advantage can be important. But we also need to shrink  when prices are \ninadequate. We must never  write inadequately-priced policies in order to stay in the game. That \npolicy is corporate suicide. \nProperly pricing P/C insurance is part art, part  science and is definitely not a business for \noptimists. Mike Goldberg, the Berkshire executive who recruited Ajit, said it best: “We want our underwriters to daily come to work nervous, but not paralyzed.” \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nAll things considered, we like the P/C insurance business. Berkshire can financially and \npsychologically handle extreme losses without blinking. We are also not dependent on reinsurers and that gives us a material and enduring cost advantage. Finally, we have outstanding managers \n(no optimists) and are particularly well-situated to utilize the substantial sums P/C insurance \ndelivers for investment. \nOver the past two decades, our insurance business has generated $32 billion of after-tax \nprofits from underwriting, about 3.3 cents per dollar of sales after income tax. Meanwhile, our \nfloat has grown from $46 billion to $171 billion. The float is likely to grow a bit over time and, \nwith intelligent underwriting (and some luck), has a reasonable prospect of being costless. \nBerkshire Increases its Japanese Investments \nA small but important exception to our U.S.-based focus is our growing investment in \nJapan. \nIt’s been almost six years since Berkshire began purchasing shares in five Japanese \ncompanies that very successfully operate in a manner somewhat similar to Berkshire itself. The five are (alphabetically) ITOCHU, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo. Each of these large enterprises, in turn, owns interests in a vast array of businesses, many based in Japan but \nothers that operate throughout the world. \n10 \n\nBerkshire made its first purchases involving the five in July 2019. We simply looked at \ntheir financial records and were amazed at the low prices of their stocks. As the years have passed, our admiration for these companies has consistently grown. Greg has met many times with them, and I regularly follow their progress. Both of us like their capital deployment, their managements and their attitude in respect to their investors. \nEach of the five companies increase dividends when appropriate, they repurchase their \nshares when it is sensible to do so, and their top managers are far less aggressive in their compensation programs than their U.S. counterparts. \nOur holdings of the five are for the very long term, and we are committed  to supporting \ntheir boards of directors. From the start, we also agreed to keep Berkshire’s holdings below 10% of each company’s shares. But, as we approached this limit, the five companies agreed to moderately relax the ceiling. Over time , you will likely see Berkshire’s ownership of all five \nincrease somewhat. \nAt yearend, Berkshire’s aggregate cost (in dollars) was $13.8 billion and the market value \nof our holdings totaled $23.5 billion. \nMeanwhile, Berkshire has consistently – but not pursuant to any formula – increased its \nyen-denominated borrowings. All are at fixed rates, no “floaters.” Greg and I have no view on \nfuture foreign exchange rates and therefore seek a position approximating currency-neutrality. We are required, however, under GAAP rules to regularly recognize in our earnings a calculation of any gains or losses in the yen we have bo rrowed and, at yearend, had included $2.3 billion of \nafter-tax gains due to dollar strength of which $850 million occurred in 2024. \nI expect that Greg and his eventual successors will be holding this Japanese position for \nmany decades and that Berkshire will find other ways to work productively with the five companies in the future. \nWe like the current math of our yen-balanced strategy as well. As I write this, the annual \ndividend income expected from the Japanese investments in 2025 will total about $812 million and the interest cost of our yen-denominated debt will be about $135 million. \nThe Annual Gathering in Omaha \nI hope you will join us in Omaha on May 3\nrd. We are following a somewhat changed \nschedule this year, but the basics remain the same. Our goal is that you get many of your questions answered, that you connect with friends, and that you leave with a good impression of Omaha. The city looks forward to your visits. \n11 \n\nWe will have much the same group of volunteers to offer you a wide variety of Berkshire \nproducts that will lighten your wallet and brighten your day. As usual, we will be open on Friday from noon until 5 p.m. with lovable Squishmallows, underwear from Fruit of the Loom, Brooks running shoes and a host of other items to tempt you. \nAgain, we will have only one book for sale. Last year we featured Poor Charlie’s \nAlmanack  and sold out – 5,000 copies disappeared before the close of business on Saturday. \nThis year we will offer 60 Years of Berkshire Hathaway . In 2015, I asked Carrie Sova, \nwho among her many duties managed much of the activity at the annual meeting, to try her hand at putting together a light-hearted history of Berkshire. I gave her full reign to use her imagination, and she quickly produced a book that blew me away with its ingenuity, contents and design. \nSubsequently, Carrie left Berkshire to raise a family and now has three children. But each \nsummer, the Berkshire office force gets together to watch the Omaha Storm Chasers play baseball against a Triple A opponent. I ask a few alums to join us, and Carrie usually comes with her family. At this year’s event, I brazenly asked her if she would do a 60\nth Anniversary issue, \nfeaturing Charlie’s photos, quotes and stories that have seldom been made public. \nEven with three young children to manage, Carrie immediately said “yes.” Consequently, \nwe will have 5,000 copies of the new book available for sale on Friday afternoon and from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday. \nCarrie refused any payment for her extensive work on the new “Charlie” edition. I \nsuggested she and I co-sign 20 copies to be given to any shareholder contributing $5,000 to the Stephen Center that serves homeless adults and children in South Omaha. The Kizer family, beginning with Bill Kizer, Sr., my long-time friend and Carrie’s grandfather, have for decades been assisting this worthy institution. Whatever is raised through the sale of the 20 autographed books, I will match. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nBecky Quick will cover our somewhat re-engineered gathering on Saturday. Becky \nknows Berkshire like a book and always arranges interesting interviews with managers, investors, shareholders and an occasional celebrity. She and her CNBC crew do a great job of both transmitting our meetings worldwide and archiving much Berkshire-related material. Give our director, Steve Burke, credit for the archive idea. \nWe will not have a movie this year but rather will convene a bit earlier at 8 a.m. I will \nmake a few introductory remarks, and we will promptly get to the Q&A, alternating questions between Becky and the audience. \n12 \n\nGreg and Ajit will join me in answering questions and we will take a half-hour break at \n10:30 a.m. When we reconvene at 11:00 a.m., only Greg will join me on stage. This year we will disband at 1:00 p.m. but stay open for shopping in the exhibit area until 4:00 p.m. \nYou can find the full details regarding weekend activities on page 16. Note particularly \nthe always-popular Brooks run on Sunday morning. (I will be sleeping.) \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nMy wise and good-looking sister, Bertie, of whom I wrote last year, will be attending the \nmeeting along with two of her daughters, both good-looking as well. Observers all agree that the genes producing this dazzling result flow down only the female side of the family. (Sob.) \nBertie is now 91 and we talk regularly on Sundays using old-fashion telephones for \ncommunications. We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting topics as the relative merits of our canes. In my case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on my face. \nBut Bertie regularly one-ups me by asserting that she enjoys an additional benefit: When \na woman uses a cane, she tells me, men quit “hitting” on her. Bertie’s explanation is that the male ego is such that little old ladies with canes simply aren’t an appropriate target. Presently, I have no data to counter her assertion. \nBut I have suspicions. At the meeting I can’t see much from the stage, and I would \nappreciate it if attendees would keep an eye on Bertie. Let me know if the cane is really doing its job. My bet is that she will be surrounded  by males. For those of a certain age, the scene will \nbring back memories of Scarlett O’Hara and her horde of male admirers in Gone with the Wind . \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nThe Berkshire directors and I immensely enjoy having you come to Omaha, and I predict \nthat you will have a good time and likely make some new friends. \nFebruary 22, 2025 Warren E.
